  <h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.73" data-timestamp="0.73"> OK, before you can understand how Bob's sister became the talk of the third grade and the big day that led to that people still remember, I need to explain first that Bob's sister is a drawing. The teacher in this third grade class, Mr. Ablao, spotted it one day while teaching math. He saw one of the students, Antonio, working on a picture.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Ablao</h4><p begin="00:00:20.81" data-timestamp="20.81"> I went over to him and said put the picture away. I probably did that two or three times. And then the fourth time I went over, and I just took the picture and said, pay attention. It's math class.</p><p begin="00:00:31.34" data-timestamp="31.34">And I put it on my desk. He came up right before recess and was like, can I have my picture back? And I was like, what is this picture of anyways? And he said, it's Bob's sister. And I'm like, who's Bob's sister? Turns out Bob's sister is a minion, which I don't even think Bob's sister exists in the minion world.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:49.79" data-timestamp="49.79"> You're saying the minions like from the movie, <i>Despicable</i> <i>Me?</i></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Ablao</h4><p begin="00:00:52.67" data-timestamp="52.67"> Yes, exactly.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:53.87" data-timestamp="53.87"> And he had just invented like a sister character for Bob?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Ablao</h4><p begin="00:00:56.69" data-timestamp="56.69"> Yeah, apparently.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:59.62" data-timestamp="59.62"> Mr. Ablao taped the drawing to the bookshelf behind his desk near a photo of a wolf that was already there. Because it was clear if Antonio kept the drawing, it would continue to be a distraction to him and a couple of his friends, who, at that point, were the only ones in class who really cared about Bob's sister.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Ablao</h4><p begin="00:01:14.50" data-timestamp="74.5"> I was like, don't worry. She's not going anywhere. She'll be right here. Anytime you want to see her, she'll be behind me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:19.33" data-timestamp="79.33"> Because the kids were into the picture of Bob's sister?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Ablao</h4><p begin="00:01:21.52" data-timestamp="81.52"> Yeah. And I didn't really quite understand why. I never investigated why this picture was such a big deal. But yeah, they would talk about it. They would go up and look at it. And, yeah, it was a thing.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:32.38" data-timestamp="92.38"> Why were you guys so excited about Bob's sister, do you think?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dylan</h4><p begin="00:01:35.83" data-timestamp="95.83"> I think it's because it was like another distraction in class that people could talk about.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:41.31" data-timestamp="101.31"> Well, that's straightforward enough.</p><p begin="00:01:43.33" data-timestamp="103.33">This is Dylan, one of Antonio's friends, who was into Bob's sister from the start.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:48.04" data-timestamp="108.04"> Describe the drawing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dylan</h4><p begin="00:01:49.66" data-timestamp="109.66"> It's just like an octopus, and then it had two eyes and then tentacles coming out of it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:57.64" data-timestamp="117.64"> I didn't realize Bob's sister was an octopus?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dylan</h4><p begin="00:02:00.19" data-timestamp="120.19"> Bob's sister was an octopus.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:02.11" data-timestamp="122.11"> But Bob's a minion.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dylan</h4><p begin="00:02:04.89" data-timestamp="124.89"> Well, it didn't really have anything to do with that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:08.47" data-timestamp="128.47"> And was he referring to the minion Bob, or am I just--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dylan</h4><p begin="00:02:11.37" data-timestamp="131.37"> No--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:11.70" data-timestamp="131.7"> No.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dylan</h4><p begin="00:02:11.97" data-timestamp="131.97"> --he was not.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:13.02" data-timestamp="133.02"> I see. Was it a good drawing?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dylan</h4><p begin="00:02:16.32" data-timestamp="136.32"> It was like, an eight-year-old's OK drawing. Like, it wasn't amazing, but it was like, you knew what it was.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:26.63" data-timestamp="146.63"> This whole question-- is it an octopus, is it a minion-- I asked Antonio, who drew Bob's sister-- about that. He tended to see Bob's sister as a Pac-Man ghost with big eyes, but he said-- and I thought it was surprisingly mature for somebody in elementary school. He thought part of the appeal of Bob's sister was that it was open to interpretation.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Antonio</h4><p begin="00:02:45.89" data-timestamp="165.89"> I really don't know what it is. It's a thing. I don't know what it-- it's lots of different things. You could think of it as a minion that looks weird. You could think of it as Fly Guy with no legs. You could think of it as Pac-Man ghost with big eyes.</p><p begin="00:02:59.72" data-timestamp="179.72">Bob's sister was different to everybody. We never went with one of them. We didn't say anything. Anyone could believe what they want.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:06.74" data-timestamp="186.74"> But the thing that was key to Bob's sister was, Bob's sister wasn't actually anyone's sister.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Antonio</h4><p begin="00:03:13.25" data-timestamp="193.25"> His name was just Bobsister, no space.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:15.62" data-timestamp="195.62"> That's really funny.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Antonio</h4><p begin="00:03:17.06" data-timestamp="197.06"> And we didn't come up with a gender either.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:19.46" data-timestamp="199.46"> So Bobsister, gender unspecified, lived on the bookshelf near the photo of a wolf, until one week when Mr. Ablao went on vacation, and the kids had a substitute. When Mr. Ablao came back, Bobsister was gone, vanished, disappeared, and was all the kids wanted to talk about. This is the point where everybody in class gets very, very interested in Bobsister.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Ablao</h4><p begin="00:03:44.74" data-timestamp="224.74"> There's kind of all this speculation about what happened to Bobsister. Was she stolen? Was she murdered? Did she die? And so I go and I look a little bit. I looked under the desk. I looked behind the bookshelf and--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:01.30" data-timestamp="241.3"> Did you ask the substitute?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Ablao</h4><p begin="00:04:03.82" data-timestamp="243.82"> I did, actually. He had no idea what I was talking about, which was good enough for me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:09.28" data-timestamp="249.28"> Oh, really? For me, that makes him suspect number one.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Ablao</h4><p begin="00:04:12.01" data-timestamp="252.01"> [LAUGHS] Interesting.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:15.46" data-timestamp="255.46"> There's your guy. Do you not watch any crime drama at all?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Ablao</h4><p begin="00:04:18.64" data-timestamp="258.64"> [LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:04:19.41" data-timestamp="259.41"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:24.61" data-timestamp="264.61"> There are all kinds of theories about what happened to Bobsister. Antonio and Dylan said it was really fun to talk about various abductors, including animals from an alternate universe. But Dylan says the prime suspect for his classmates-- that other picture on the bookshelf.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dylan</h4><p begin="00:04:38.77" data-timestamp="278.77"> They just decided that the wolf ate it because it was like, right above the wolf.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:44.26" data-timestamp="284.26"> Like the wolf was jealous or something.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dylan</h4><p begin="00:04:46.51" data-timestamp="286.51"> They didn't really know why. That's what they said.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:49.93" data-timestamp="289.93"> Who said that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dylan</h4><p begin="00:04:52.31" data-timestamp="292.31"> Basically, everybody.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:54.20" data-timestamp="294.2"> I mean, he's a wolf.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dylan</h4><p begin="00:04:55.79" data-timestamp="295.79"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:57.42" data-timestamp="297.42"> The chatter about Bobsister does not go away, which is funny, but also Mr. Ablao's got a curriculum to get through.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Ablao</h4><p begin="00:05:03.45" data-timestamp="303.45"> I'm kind of vaguely annoyed because there's a lot going on in the school day, and I don't have much time to think about a picture of Bobsister. But they're kind of pestering me about it.</p><p begin="00:05:13.60" data-timestamp="313.6">And then one other student--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:16.53" data-timestamp="316.53"> Dylan, actually.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Ablao</h4><p begin="00:05:17.79" data-timestamp="317.79"> --pipes in and says, can we have a funeral for Bobsister? And I'm like, what are you talking about? And they're like, well, she died. Something happened.</p><p begin="00:05:30.36" data-timestamp="330.36">And I'm like, a funeral for Bobsister, a picture? And I say yes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:38.19" data-timestamp="338.19"> Probably just to get them to stop talking about Bobsister, but also, this is the kind of teacher he is. He says, sometimes, it's smart to take some detours, follow things where they lead.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Ablao</h4><p begin="00:05:49.14" data-timestamp="349.14"> And they're like, when? I'm like, I don't know when. I don't know when this funeral's going to happen. And they're like, when? When's it going to happen? When's it going to happen? We are going to have a funeral for Bobsister. And so then, finally, I'm like, after recess on Friday.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:09.70" data-timestamp="369.7"> That was Monday. The rest of the week goes pretty normally. Mr. Ablao sort of hoped that they would forget about the funeral by the end of the week, but no way. They're murmuring about it, preparing for it, which he has no part of.</p><p begin="00:06:21.13" data-timestamp="381.13">The eight-year-olds are the ones organizing this and thinking it through. Finally, Friday arrives, the big day, the day of the funeral, kids come back into the room from recess.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Ablao</h4><p begin="00:06:30.64" data-timestamp="390.64"> They're pretty giddy and pretty excited. So finally, I'm like, OK, game on, let's go. Funeral. I have no idea what is about to transpire. All of a sudden, boom, the tables kind of move out of the way.</p><p begin="00:06:45.70" data-timestamp="405.7">The leader of the funeral comes up with the stool. Two other students bring two tables and grab the flowers. Apparently, a bunch of girls had been making posters. They write Bobsister's Funeral on the board.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:01.42" data-timestamp="421.42"> Dylan's the leader of the funeral, and he prepared a eulogy. So did his friend, Theo. Dylan gets in front of the class holding a microphone Mr. Ablao keeps in the room.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Ablao</h4><p begin="00:07:10.49" data-timestamp="430.49"> The rest of the class is totally on the edge of their seats, just waiting for this kid to start the funeral, like, paying more attention to him than they had ever paid to me. They're just like, ready for it. He starts out kind of ad-libbing about welcoming everyone, thanking everyone for coming to celebrate the life of Bobsister.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:33.44" data-timestamp="453.44"> Now, how did you know what to say in a eulogy?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dylan</h4><p begin="00:07:37.85" data-timestamp="457.85"> We didn't. We just said like some things that sounded about right. Like, something that you might say at a funeral that might make someone cry.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:48.32" data-timestamp="468.32"> Do you have your eulogy there?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dylan</h4><p begin="00:07:50.09" data-timestamp="470.09"> Yeah. Take it out?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:52.37" data-timestamp="472.37"> Could you read it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dylan</h4><p begin="00:07:53.60" data-timestamp="473.6"> OK, one sec. And then it sort of-- mine also says sort of back and forth she and he, so. Because I didn't really know. "Bobsister was a great person. People thought that Bob was just a drawing on a piece of paper, but I knew he was anything but that. But she is still in here. She made me think I could do things in school. If she was here today, she would say, keep on trying."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:23.26" data-timestamp="503.26"> That's really nice. It sounds like you were trying to be sort of inspiring.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dylan</h4><p begin="00:08:27.31" data-timestamp="507.31"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:29.20" data-timestamp="509.2"> Had you seen a eulogy in a movie or something that you knew what to do?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dylan</h4><p begin="00:08:32.23" data-timestamp="512.23"> Nope, never.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:33.07" data-timestamp="513.07"> Whoa.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:08:34.76" data-timestamp="514.76"> The other eulogy that Theo wrote was also really good. "I just want to say something about the special person here, Bobsister, how she was such a good friend to all the potatoes, and especially Mr. Potato Head." Potatoes were another fascination of Mr. Ablao's class that year. "What an honor it was to have her with us. God bless her." And then, from the back of the room, Mr. Ablao hears a boy crying.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Ablao</h4><p begin="00:09:00.67" data-timestamp="540.67"> I would say almost wailing, but it was like a real cry. And at first, I'm thinking, oh my god, now they're just turning this into a joke. And then, I realized that he's actually seriously crying. Like, this is not a joke cry.</p><p begin="00:09:15.00" data-timestamp="555">And I walked back there. And everyone kind of turns back. Everyone's looking at both of us. And so I asked him. I'm like, what's wrong? What's going on? Why are you crying?</p><p begin="00:09:30.48" data-timestamp="570.48">And he's like, it's because Bobsister died. And I was like, it's not about anything else, maybe? And he's like, no, it's Bobsister's died, and it's just so sad.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:45.00" data-timestamp="585"> Mr. Ablao thinks maybe it was really about his dog. The dog that boy had grown up with had died just two weeks before. His mom had sent an email to let him know. But Mr. Ablao's really not sure. At eight, you're plenty old enough to catch a glimpse of what death means.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Ablao</h4><p begin="00:09:59.35" data-timestamp="599.35"> And then I look up, and then the whole kind of feel of the classroom has changed. It's gone from kind of giddy excitement, this is a fun thing, to half the class is nervously laughing, and the other half looks like they're on the verge of tears. Like, there's about three girls that are kind of really sad.</p><p begin="00:10:19.02" data-timestamp="619.02">And I was like, oh no, what have I created? This was reaching an emotional level that I actually had never experienced before, and I've been teaching for about 15 years. And I had never felt kind of this-- not that it was getting out of control, but it was leading to something that I didn't know how it was going to end, honestly. Like, I don't know what's going to happen next. If three other kids start crying, I don't know how to handle the situation.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:51.15" data-timestamp="651.15"> Right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Ablao</h4><p begin="00:10:52.39" data-timestamp="652.39"> I had never experienced kind of that in a classroom.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:57.19" data-timestamp="657.19"> It's so interesting. It's like they were playing around with, I don't know, like with a Ouija board and joking around, and suddenly, they accidentally summoned a demon into the room.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Ablao</h4><p begin="00:11:06.85" data-timestamp="666.85"> Yeah. In a way. And for me, I was right there on the Ouija board with them.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:11.69" data-timestamp="671.69"> And so this monster is in the room. You've unleashed this really kind of a primal force, like this grief, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Ablao</h4><p begin="00:11:18.22" data-timestamp="678.22"> Yeah. Grief, death. And I mean, one of the really neat things about third grade is it's-- I mean, there's a saying. "They stop learning to read and are reading to learn." So it's like it's an age where their world gets a lot bigger. They kind of are experiencing real things, and I think a funeral is one of those things.</p><p begin="00:11:44.20" data-timestamp="704.2">They probably all heard of a funeral. They read them in books. But most of them probably hadn't been to one and didn't know what that felt like.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:52.72" data-timestamp="712.72"> And Mr. Ablao felt responsible to help them through this new experience, like he had lots of others that year. So he took control of the room back from the kids and addressed them all.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Ablao</h4><p begin="00:12:03.31" data-timestamp="723.31"> I was like, well, funerals are kind of serious. Sometimes, when you go to a funeral, it's very sad because you're missing the person that's moved on. And sometimes, it reminds you of other people who have moved on. And it's important to remember those people, and it's important to be sad. And this is the end of the funeral.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:29.41" data-timestamp="749.41"> Which worked. Everybody snapped out of it. The demon left the room. Next, was free time, which they all enjoy. And everything was fine.</p><p begin="00:12:37.36" data-timestamp="757.36">But at the end of the school year, when the class stood in a circle and each kid names something that they remembered and liked from third grade, a couple of the kids said Bobsister's funeral. It was a moment for Mr. Ablao, too.</p><p begin="00:12:51.06" data-timestamp="771.06">Sometimes, you're joking around and it's all light and fun and trying something you've never done before, and some bigger subterranean force gets unleashed. That's what our show is going to be about today-- those moments when you get a glimpse of all that feeling that's there down below, hidden from sight. From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

They're visible to everybody. They are literally there to be seen.</p><p begin="00:13:35.60" data-timestamp="815.6">But then, just below them down in front, there's the orchestra pit. And it seems straightforward enough what happens in there. Musicians play their instruments.</p><p begin="00:13:44.94" data-timestamp="824.94">But other things go on in there, all kinds of interactions and feelings that usually we don't get much of a picture of. You know the old saying "hell is other people?" It actually comes from the theater, it comes from a play, <i>No</i> <i>Exit.</i></p><p begin="00:13:58.61" data-timestamp="838.61">That play was not written by somebody who sits in the orchestra pit. But Jay Caspian Kang has this story about how many musicians in theatrical orchestras might understand the sentiment. We first broadcast this story back in 2020. We are bringing it back today with an update. Here's Jay.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jay Caspian Kang</h4><p begin="00:14:14.96" data-timestamp="854.96"> Nick Jemo moved to New York in 2006 to try to make it as a musician.

Her answer always depended on parking. It's hard to park in Midtown, Manhattan. A good parking spot was a good day. A bad parking spot was a bad day. This is how she made sense of her life.</p><p begin="00:32:26.63" data-timestamp="1946.63">I think about this all the time. Most of our lives are spent finding parking for the job we don't want to do. Melanie's not alone in that. And after any number of years, those routines accumulate, and that's more or less your life.</p><p begin="00:32:47.09" data-timestamp="1967.09">Of all the people I talked to in the pit, one musician dealt with the mundane and inevitable repetition of life in a way that really stuck with me. For the past two decades in the pit, Kurt, the musician who described himself as a violin operator, has been dreaming up the most elaborate and metaphorically perfect coping mechanism. It's a band made up entirely of automatons. I met these robot musicians in a warehouse in Yonkers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kurt Coble</h4><p begin="00:33:15.80" data-timestamp="1995.8"> The PAM Band.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jay Caspian Kang</h4><p begin="00:33:17.60" data-timestamp="1997.6"> The PAM Band stands for Partially Artificial Musicians. Kurt's automatons are made up of scraps of metal and string, all wired up to a soundboard that Kurt can program to create whatever sounds he wants. There's Magnus, an electric chord organ, Krieg, the bass guitar, and then there's Rosie, the theremin.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kurt Coble</h4><p begin="00:33:37.16" data-timestamp="2017.16"> This is Jack, a solid-body electric violin using the exoskeleton design. This is what helps alleviate the boredom of the redundancy of <i>Phantom.</i> Because I'm constantly thinking about this project and how I can improve the automation and the kind of music that I would like to create.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Caspian Kang</h4><p begin="00:34:06.49" data-timestamp="2046.49"> Why did you decide to do this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kurt Coble</h4><p begin="00:34:11.14" data-timestamp="2051.14"> If I ever see a therapist, maybe they will help me understand that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Caspian Kang</h4><p begin="00:34:14.60" data-timestamp="2054.6"> Let's pretend I'm a therapist.</p><p begin="00:34:15.42" data-timestamp="2055.42">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:34:17.44" data-timestamp="2057.44">Like, was there part of it where you're like, man, I am playing in this orchestra, I'm not-- it's not the expressiveness that I want, I also kind of feel like an automaton? You know? And maybe I just make an automaton as a violinist.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kurt Coble</h4><p begin="00:34:31.13" data-timestamp="2071.13"> Sure, yeah. I mean, I can see exploring that-- am I looking for some kind of soul healing from this dehumanization of being in a violin section? Possibly. [CHUCKLES]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jay Caspian Kang</h4><p begin="00:34:50.94" data-timestamp="2090.94"> I asked Kurt if the PAM Band could play "The Music of the Night," or "All I Ask of You," or any of the <i>Phantom</i> classics. He wasn't into that, at all. This band was not designed to play Andrew Lloyd Webber.</p><p begin="00:35:03.86" data-timestamp="2103.86">But something inside him just couldn't get away from <i>Phantom</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Opera.</i> Back when he was sitting in the pit, he'd composed, just in his head, both the prequel and the sequel to <i>Phantom,</i> both which involve Indiana Jones-type characters.</p><p begin="00:35:18.41" data-timestamp="2118.41">And years ago, he got a copy of the 1925 silent film version of <i>Phantom</i> and wrote an entire score. He wanted to play it for me. He turned off the lights in the warehouse and projected the film onto the wall. The PAM Band started to play.</p><p begin="00:35:34.89" data-timestamp="2134.89">The score features him, Kurt, as a solo violinist and the star of the show. The automatons all play the same thing, but Kurt always improvises. None of his shows are ever the same.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:35:58.62" data-timestamp="2158.62"> Jay Caspian Kang is a staff writer for <i>The</i> <i>New</i> <i>Yorker</i> and co-host of the podcast, <i>Time</i> <i>to</i> <i>Say</i> <i>Goodbye.</i> His story was produced by Miki Meek.</p><p begin="00:36:07.25" data-timestamp="2167.25">So we first broadcast that story three years ago. And now, the decades of repetition in the <i>Phantom</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Opera</i> pit are finally coming to an end. After 35 years, the longest-running show in Broadway history is closing this week. Curious how the musicians in the pit were taking the news, Jay caught up with Melanie, the oboe player, when she just had four shows left to play. Jay asked about the moment when everybody who works on the show heard definitively, during a big Zoom meeting, actually, that the show was finally closing.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Caspian Kang</h4><p begin="00:36:41.12" data-timestamp="2201.12"> What was your first thought? Because I remember that we had talked about it, and you sort of-- you and Lowell and Pete had all sort of fantasized about it. Because I asked you about this a lot, just like, well, what are you going to-- like, when you leave, how is it going to feel?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melanie Feld</h4><p begin="00:36:56.72" data-timestamp="2216.72"> Right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Caspian Kang</h4><p begin="00:36:57.23" data-timestamp="2217.23"> And so like, how did it actually feel? Like, 'cause you finally got confirmation that, OK, this is actually going to end.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melanie Feld</h4><p begin="00:37:03.75" data-timestamp="2223.75"> So the first thing is the dropping-of-your-gut-into-the-cellar kind of feeling, of shock, just complete shock. Like the-bottom-is-falling-out-of-my-world kind of feeling. I was upset.</p><p begin="00:37:15.77" data-timestamp="2235.77">So what I do-- I said, I don't want to be sad, so I will be angry. Let's choose anger. And I said, I'm going to focus on all the things I hate. And that way, I won't be sad. And so that's what I did.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Caspian Kang</h4><p begin="00:37:29.10" data-timestamp="2249.1"> Well, did it work? Like, did it work to--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melanie Feld</h4><p begin="00:37:31.20" data-timestamp="2251.2"> Yeah, I was so successful.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Caspian Kang</h4><p begin="00:37:33.15" data-timestamp="2253.15"> --to just focus on everything you hate, instead of whatever feelings of sadness or regret or even fear that might have popped up?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melanie Feld</h4><p begin="00:37:41.76" data-timestamp="2261.76"> No, this is at the beginning. OK, so, I was so good, right? I was so successful. Now that it's imminent, I do feel different. So now, it's much more of a rollercoaster up and down. Right now, there's all kinds of exciting activities going on.</p><p begin="00:38:00.21" data-timestamp="2280.21">And then, you can sort of forget that it's closing. I am certainly sad about it. It's an entire way of life. I can't even really imagine knowing it will never be back. But most of those people, I'm never going to see again.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Caspian Kang</h4><p begin="00:38:18.67" data-timestamp="2298.67"> Are people being nicer to one another in the pit?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melanie Feld</h4><p begin="00:38:21.58" data-timestamp="2301.58"> Thank you for asking. [LAUGHS] People are being so nice. I'm trying to be quieter about things that annoy me, but fewer things are annoying me. And it's all very festive and fun.</p><p begin="00:38:32.06" data-timestamp="2312.06">We had a really fun photo op on Friday. They had a full company photo call, so. I really enjoyed it, because everybody was up on stage. They all gave us a poster, and everyone's getting their posters signed like your high school yearbook.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Caspian Kang</h4><p begin="00:38:45.97" data-timestamp="2325.97"> You know, when I first interviewed you several years ago, one of the things that you told me that made me laugh a lot was that you, after playing 20-something years at the time of the show, had never actually seen the show. And that sort of blew my mind, because I was like, how do you go every night? Like, you've never actually seen the show?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melanie Feld</h4><p begin="00:39:05.92" data-timestamp="2345.92"> Yeah. So I realized that I really wanted to see the show, and I asked the management, and they set me up at the soundboard. And it was wonderful. This is just last week, I think.</p><p begin="00:39:19.52" data-timestamp="2359.52">And what amazed me was the pageantry of it, the beauty of it. I had no idea. You see them bringing in all the ice backstage, outside of the stage door, every day. So there's a giant ice container, the dry ice, and then they carry it in.</p><p begin="00:39:33.73" data-timestamp="2373.73">And then, we used to complain about the smoke. But I never knew what the smoke did. And so it creates this incredible atmosphere, and then there's all these lights. Like, we see the candelabra under the stage, but they're not lit under the stage.</p><p begin="00:39:49.37" data-timestamp="2389.37">And so I got to see them on the stage. And I got to see the Phantom and Christine at the end of-- I don't know which number it was, but they just disappear. I mean, it's a trapdoor, but you have this effect that they're just disappearing. And I feel like a little kid, in a way-- just awestruck by all these things that other people have seen so many times.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:40:19.59" data-timestamp="2419.59"> 11 people who are going to be in the pit closing night are musicians who were there on opening night, back in 1988. I was able to reach Lowell Hershey, who, as Jay pointed out in the story, everybody calls the sanest person in the pit. Like Melanie, Lowell has other gigs lined up for after <i>Phantom</i> closes, here and there. Nothing big, nothing too challenging.</p><p begin="00:40:40.17" data-timestamp="2440.17">Neither of them imagines playing for another Broadway show, either as a sub or as a regular player. Lowell, I have to say, was very chill about the closing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lowell Hershey</h4><p begin="00:40:50.74" data-timestamp="2450.74"> You know, I can't say that I didn't enjoy going to work. I did. It's fun for me to do that, and so I will miss that. But you know, I think I can find other things that will interest me. I don't feel like I'll be bored.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:41:05.71" data-timestamp="2465.71"> How old were you on the first opening night?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lowell Hershey</h4><p begin="00:41:09.13" data-timestamp="2469.13"> I was 40.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:41:10.96" data-timestamp="2470.96"> Can I ask you to go back and imagine, for a second, 40-year-old you on the opening night of <i>Phantom?</i> If you could somehow have said to him, you will be here for 35 years, and you'll be here on closing night of this show, what would that 40-year-old have said?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lowell Hershey</h4><p begin="00:41:30.34" data-timestamp="2490.34"> Well, I would have been really happy to have heard that. Because at the time <i>Phantom</i> opened, I had an 11- and a 13-year-old-- two kids, and college was coming up. And if you told me that <i>Phantom</i> was going to go more than just a few years, and go 35, I would have been thrilled, because that would have meant that I would have some security. So yeah, I would have been very happy to have that information.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:06.32" data-timestamp="2526.32"> Coming up-- a mom goes underground, goes undercover, to get an urgent message to her daughter.

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:19.60" data-timestamp="2539.6"> It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Today's program-- "What Lies Beneath," the stories of things and people, usually hidden from view, coming to the surface. We've arrived at Act Two of our program. Act Two, "How I Met My Mother."</p><p begin="00:42:33.92" data-timestamp="2553.92">So in some families, what's buried deep below are the true feelings that people have about one another. There's so many people out there who have trouble saying directly what they really feel. One of the producers here at our show, Elna Baker, comes from a long line of passive-aggressive communicators.</p><p begin="00:42:48.38" data-timestamp="2568.38">By the way, they know this. They own it. When her grandmother wanted to get a message across, a message like, don't leave change lying around, one time, she put an article on the fridge saying, "Toddler Chokes on Penny," and then just left it to everybody else to connect the dots.</p><p begin="00:43:05.79" data-timestamp="2585.79">Elna's mother communicates in the same indirect way, which became a problem in the years after Elna left the church. Elna's family's Mormon, and her mom had some important things that she wanted to say to her. Here's Elna.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:43:19.15" data-timestamp="2599.15"> This all started when I made a joke about me buying weed to my brother. Careful, he said. If Mom were to hear that, she'd send an email to the whole family about how you're an addict. I laughed. And then, I was like, wait, what? That was way too specific.</p><p begin="00:43:35.25" data-timestamp="2615.25">Did Mom send an email to the whole family about me being an addict? And he was like, uh, mm, nothing, never mind, which could only mean one thing. She did. It took several rounds of questioning before I got the whole story.</p><p begin="00:43:49.55" data-timestamp="2629.55">The email he was referencing-- my mom had sent it 10 years ago. At the time, I was about to host a comedy show in New York, where me and a bunch of performers would play drinking games on stage. It was called <i>The</i> <i>Drunk</i> <i>Show.</i></p><p begin="00:44:03.23" data-timestamp="2643.23">The show was being promoted online. My mom, a devout Mormon, saw an article about it and freaked out. Mormons don't drink. It's against the religion.</p><p begin="00:44:13.55" data-timestamp="2653.55">And what I learned from my brother, years after the fact, is that my mom was so worried that I was doing this show, she sent an email to my family, my extended family, uncles, cousins, and family friends who I grew up with, like the Mitchells, the Coxes-- Heidi, my middle school drama teacher.</p><p begin="00:44:31.61" data-timestamp="2671.61">"Dear friends," it begins. "I am writing, because I am concerned about the direction Elna's life has turned. She is spiraling downward, fast."</p><p begin="00:44:40.55" data-timestamp="2680.55">My mom then explains to them that I'm doing this event called, <i>The</i> <i>Drunk</i> <i>Show,</i> then writes, "I am very concerned. In our family, you are either an alcoholic or a Mormon. And I think she may be headed in the wrong direction. I don't know what I can do personally. She doesn't hear me."</p><p begin="00:44:58.19" data-timestamp="2698.19">I'm going to interject here-- that I didn't hear her, because she never said anything to me about it. In the email, she inserts a link to the article about <i>The</i> <i>Drunk</i> <i>Show,</i> and then reveals her grand master plan. She's been commenting on the article, under fake names, warning me not to do the show.</p><p begin="00:45:16.46" data-timestamp="2716.46">"Can everyone else please make up fake accounts and also comment? This way, I'll cancel the show." She ends, "Thanks. Pray for us both, please."</p><p begin="00:45:27.85" data-timestamp="2727.85">When I read this email, I was mortified. I drink socially. I'm not an alcoholic. But since I'd never intercepted the email, I worried everyone who got it had thought this for years. I immediately clicked on the link to the article.</p><p begin="00:45:42.04" data-timestamp="2742.04">At the bottom of the page, there were four comments from four different people, trolling me, all clearly my mother. Her first fake character is Carol from the West Village, who says, quote, "Encouraging irresponsible drinking that could end in hospitalization of performers is an invitation to a lawsuit. Don't be idiots."</p><p begin="00:46:06.17" data-timestamp="2766.17">The three other comments escalate from there. Here's the weirdest part. She wrote all these comments while she was staying with me. She was in town the week of <i>The</i> <i>Drunk</i> <i>Show.</i> We slept in the same bed. But she didn't say a word to me about it.</p><p begin="00:46:20.51" data-timestamp="2780.51">As interventions go, it was the least successful one I've ever heard of or could imagine. No one else among the family or friends chimed in. And I, the target of the intervention, never knew it happened. I never heard of or read the comments online until my brother accidentally let it slip, years later.</p><p begin="00:46:41.15" data-timestamp="2801.15">Since I found out about this, I've wondered why my mom chose to communicate this message to me the way she did. But I've never asked her, because I figured it would just lead to a fight and no answers. But we're much closer now than we were when I did <i>The</i> <i>Drunk</i> <i>Show.</i> Why not try?</p><p begin="00:46:57.41" data-timestamp="2817.41">To my surprise, she agreed to talk about it, but on these conditions. Dad had to be there, in case we needed mediation. I had to come home for Christmas in exchange. And most importantly, I could only do this story if she got to write the ending, which we'll get to later.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:47:15.23" data-timestamp="2835.23"> Talk for a second?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:47:17.33" data-timestamp="2837.33"> Hi, Elna.

Gary's grandfather died of alcoholism.</p><p begin="00:51:44.31" data-timestamp="3104.31">So that's how I get there. It's not like it's a Mormon thing. It's an experience that has affected me.

I think if you just told me not to do it, I would have-- I would have done exactly what you're saying. But if we'd had a full conversation where we really talked-- like, so for example, I didn't know until just now, until we've had this conversation-- like, I didn't really know that much about your family history with drinking.</p><p begin="00:53:39.50" data-timestamp="3219.5">You don't talk about these unpleasant things, so that when you're so against drinking, I think I did think it was just had to do with Mormonism, and not that it had to do with really painful things you witnessed in your life. Because you never told me about them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:53:55.45" data-timestamp="3235.45"> I'm sure I've said this statement before in your life.

I've never met any of these family members who drank. I don't remember her ever mentioning any of these stories. I saw my mother as sheltered. Almost all her friends are Mormon. I just thought she doesn't know what she's talking about, which was unfair.</p><p begin="00:54:42.03" data-timestamp="3282.03">When I make a radio story, I listen to my interviews over and over again. And this time, something unusual started to happen. With each listen, my mother sounded less and less like my mother.</p><p begin="00:54:52.95" data-timestamp="3292.95">Like, I stopped hearing her the way I usually do-- rolling my eyes, getting defensive. And I actually started to hear what she had to say. This is the line that struck me the hardest.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:55:04.17" data-timestamp="3304.17"> Elna, we've already been there. You don't hear me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:55:10.02" data-timestamp="3310.02"> She's right. And I can hear in her voice that this has been hurting her feelings for years. And that's my fault. I see why she thinks it's hopeless to talk to me about drinking, about anything. I'm incredibly dismissive. That's my part in this.</p><p begin="00:55:26.49" data-timestamp="3326.49">And her part-- she was totally upfront about that. She didn't want to confront me about drinking, because she has so much trouble with confrontation of any kind, with anyone, going back to when she was young.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:55:38.72" data-timestamp="3338.72"> I mean, as a little kid, I used to just admit fault to anything that happened in our family in order to get the confrontation to be over with.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:55:51.02" data-timestamp="3351.02"> I never understood before this conversation what that feels like for her. She panics, feels trapped, like she needs to run, tightness in her chest, which is what makes this conversation so hard.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:56:03.71" data-timestamp="3363.71"> This is-- we're doing exactly what I hate to do.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:56:06.56" data-timestamp="3366.56"> What?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:56:08.58" data-timestamp="3368.58"> Talk about conflict.

You're welcome, Elna. Anything for my daughter.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:56:46.99" data-timestamp="3406.99"> I knew what this meant. From the tone of her voice, it was time to stop. This was the most direct conversation I've ever had with my mother and the longest real conversation we've ever had. She'd gone above and beyond and did something she did not enjoy, for me. I could return the favor and call it a day.</p><p begin="00:57:09.40" data-timestamp="3429.4">Well, folks, my ticket home for Christmas is booked. And now, for the ending my mother requested-- it comes down to three words-- "She was right." Not about me spiraling downward fast, but about <i>The</i> <i>Drunk</i> <i>Show.</i></p><p begin="00:57:23.63" data-timestamp="3443.63">For the record, <i>The</i> <i>Drunk</i> <i>Show</i> was a disaster. I was the one who organized the drinking games, but because I'd only recently left the church, I was brand new to drinking. And all the penalties in the games were things like, take four shots of whiskey.</p><p begin="00:57:38.51" data-timestamp="3458.51">Things went off the rails quickly. A performer threw a chair at an audience member. I drunk-dialed my ex from the stage, and the call went so badly, that I started crying in front of the audience. Ira, who was in the show, got blackout drunk-- for the first time in his life, he said-- and then threw up into a trash bag.</p><p begin="00:57:58.19" data-timestamp="3478.19">And someone ended up in the hospital. My mom knew none of those details, of course. But big picture-- Carol from the West Village knew what she was talking about when she said irresponsible drinking can lead to hospitalization. In other words, Mom was right.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:58:24.64" data-timestamp="3504.64"> Elna Baker is one of the producers of our show and the author of the book, <i>The</i> <i>New</i> <i>York</i> <i>Regional</i> <i>Mormon</i> <i>Singles</i> <i>Halloween</i> <i>Dance.</i></p><p begin="00:58:32.43" data-timestamp="3512.43">["JUST UNDER THE SURFACE" BY VENICE]</p><p begin="00:58:34.82" data-timestamp="3514.82"></p><p begin="00:58:56.85" data-timestamp="3536.85"></p></div>  </div>
