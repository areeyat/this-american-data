  <h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:11.70" data-timestamp="11.7"> My dad's ATM password was 1119 till the day he died. 1119 was also in the password for his home WiFi network. 1119 was shorthand for 1119 Bayard Street, which is where his grandfather, my great grandfather, owned a tiny grocery store on the ground floor of a house in downtown Baltimore in the 1920s, '30s, '40s, '50s.</p><p begin="00:00:33.78" data-timestamp="33.78">Picture a neighborhood bodega, and you've got the general size of this thing. The family lived upstairs, worked downstairs. So much happened at 1119 Bayard. So many things about our family were set in motion there. But my sisters and I only got little scraps of stories about the place, this handful of family-defining origin stories that got trotted out now and then.</p><p begin="00:00:56.04" data-timestamp="56.04">Like, for instance, there was the one about the chickens. My dad and his brother Lenny both worked in the store from the time they were little kids. And chickens were slaughtered at the store, which freaked them out, both of them. To the point where, decades later, as grown men, neither of them ate chicken, and they'd explain this was the reason why.</p><p begin="00:01:17.63" data-timestamp="77.63">Or there's the story about my great grandfather's bookkeeping skills. I'm actually named for my great grandfather, Isadore Friedlander. My parents chose Ira instead of Isadore because Isadore Glass is a parsable English sentence-- "Is a door glass?" My mom once told me that they picked Ira over the alternatives because it sounded less Jewish to them, which just goes to show how completely, utterly Jewish their entire world was back then.</p><p begin="00:01:48.24" data-timestamp="108.24">I've heard all my life what a kind-hearted man Isadore was and a soft touch, which brings me to this next story we would hear now and then. During the Depression, when everybody in the neighborhood was broke and buying on credit, Isadore set up a system where every customer would have a little book, like this flimsy paper thing, where he would write down what they owed.</p><p begin="00:02:11.58" data-timestamp="131.58">But the thing about the system was the customer kept the book. Maybe you see the problem with this. All the time, customers would show up at the store and say, I lost my book. And Isadore would say to them, ah, it's OK. What do you think you owe? And then they'd say some not very high number. And he'd write it down and hand them a new book to take home.</p><p begin="00:02:36.15" data-timestamp="156.15">Years later, my dad became a certified public accountant. And this became one of those "the day Peter Parker got bit by the radioactive spider" sort of origin stories, what bad bookkeeping he saw his grandfather do at 1119 Bayard and how he was going to do better.</p><p begin="00:02:56.05" data-timestamp="176.05">I'm sure some good things happened at 1119 Bayard, but those stories didn't get passed down. We heard painful things. My dad was miserable working there. So was his brother. His mom, my Grandma Frieda, got out of the store, went to college, taught Latin in junior high school, but then got dragged back into the family business against her will, like Michael Corleone, when her dad, Isadore, got sick.</p><p begin="00:03:21.24" data-timestamp="201.24">I visited 1119 Bayard-- I don't know-- maybe half a dozen times in my life, a dozen times. Usually it would happen when my Uncle Lenny came to town. He and my dad would drive us all downtown, and we'd stand outside 1119 Bayard. And the two of them would marvel at the place, at the fact of it, and I think at the distance they'd come from there-- my dad with his accounting firm out in the suburbs, my uncle, who became a surgeon and moved to San Diego, their kids raised in the kind of middle class comfort that we ate all the chicken we could ever want.</p><p begin="00:03:56.26" data-timestamp="236.26">I always found those trips disappointing. We'd take a picture and hang around there on the sidewalk. It's not a store anymore. It's just somebody's house. It doesn't look like anything. A rowhouse in a block of rowhouses. At some point a few years ago, somebody painted a cheerful Christian mural on one side of the building with a quote from the <i>Book</i> <i>of</i> <i>Mark.</i></p><p begin="00:04:18.65" data-timestamp="258.65">Every time I've gone to 1119 Bayard and stood on the sidewalk, I've tried to picture it, my family there long ago, Frieda in her 30s, at the cash register against her will, my dad as a little boy, opening boxes and putting stuff on shelves. I'm not great at that kind of thing. It's like trying to summon ghosts with a Ouija board, and the little pointer refuses to budge.</p><p begin="00:04:46.07" data-timestamp="286.07">We've all got these spots from our family's past, and we go to them. And they're like Civil War battlefields that have been washed of blood long ago. We pause there and look at the trees and the grassy fields. And we want-- what? Some connection to something. I am who I am partly because of this place. But now it's mute.</p><p begin="00:05:11.79" data-timestamp="311.79">So we take a selfie and try to tune into the past, like a distant radio station whose signal we can just barely make out.</p><p begin="00:05:21.33" data-timestamp="321.33">Today on our program, we have a story of somebody else who heads out to a place like that from his family's history, looking for answers. And he gets so much more out of it than I ever did at 1119 Bayard about who he is. From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.</p><p begin="00:05:48.77" data-timestamp="348.77"></p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Part One: Part One</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:50.22" data-timestamp="350.22"> OK, so we're devoting today's entire program to this one story. It's by Boen Wang, who we've had on our show before. He's a producer whose work has its own very distinct sound and feeling. That's one of the things that we, on our staff, really like about him. Here is what he put together today for you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Boen Wang</h4><p begin="00:06:08.27" data-timestamp="368.27"> August 1989.</p><p begin="00:06:14.01" data-timestamp="374.01">My dad is in an airport. He's flown from Beijing to Tokyo to San Francisco to Denver to Oklahoma City, almost missing his flight multiple times because he can't understand the announcements in English. He is here to get a PhD from the University of Oklahoma. He's here for a new life, a life where he doesn't sit chain smoking cigarettes at his boring job in a Jeep factory, while living in a tiny room with no running water or heating or cooling. He wants a life where something changes.</p><p begin="00:06:45.99" data-timestamp="405.99">It's the middle of the night in the Oklahoma City airport. He had sent a letter to the university with the date and time of his arrival, so that someone could pick him up. He scans the crowd, looking for someone holding a sign with his name on it, but finds no one. One by one, the crowd thins out until my dad is stuck in the middle of this airport in the middle of this foreign country, a stranger in a strange land.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Announcer</h4><p begin="00:07:12.30" data-timestamp="432.3"> Attention, airport. This is the final boarding call for the airline flight 382--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Boen Wang</h4><p begin="00:07:15.82" data-timestamp="435.82"> So you were alone?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:07:17.41" data-timestamp="437.41"> Yeah, I was alone. And I was looking for someone to pick me up. But all the passengers left, and no one stayed around, and no sign for picking me up. So as I was trying to leave, thinking what I'm going to do, and then this nice gentleman approached me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Boen Wang</h4><p begin="00:07:46.18" data-timestamp="466.18"> This nice gentleman, the first white American my dad ever talks to, introduces himself as Dave. Dave isn't his real name. I changed it to protect his privacy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:07:56.44" data-timestamp="476.44"> And he comes here to pick me up. He's about the same height, and he wears glasses. He has a very warm smile.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Boen Wang</h4><p begin="00:08:09.68" data-timestamp="489.68"> A warm smile.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:08:10.85" data-timestamp="490.85"> Yeah, he smiles warmly and said that he is going to take me. So I was so happy to see him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Boen Wang</h4><p begin="00:08:22.40" data-timestamp="502.4"> Dave takes my dad to his car and drives half an hour south to his home in Norman, the college town that surrounds the University of Oklahoma. My dad meets Dave's wife and, finally, having reached the end of his trans-Pacific ordeal--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:08:35.71" data-timestamp="515.71"> He told me to sleep in this room. So I took a shower and went to sleep.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Boen Wang</h4><p begin="00:08:45.71" data-timestamp="525.71"> Dave is a Christian, the leader of a local church's Chinese ministry. Dave gives my dad a bible, the first English language book he studies from cover to cover, and invites him to a weekly Bible study and Sunday service.</p><p begin="00:08:59.45" data-timestamp="539.45">In time, my dad will accept Christ. So will my mom after she arrives in America later that year. My parents will raise me and my older sister as Christians. We will attend church every Sunday in Oklahoma and then in Philly, where my dad finds a job and where I grow up. It's the perfect conversion story, the sort of testimony you'd share in front of an audience at church.</p><p begin="00:09:22.64" data-timestamp="562.64">My parents grew up during the Cultural Revolution, when the Communist Party suppressed any expression of religion. They were atheists by default. Their conversion here in America goes against everything they learned in China. The only problem with this story is me. After 22 years of Christianity, I left and never came back.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Young Boen Wang</h4><p begin="00:09:46.07" data-timestamp="586.07">(SUBJECT) YOUNG BOEN WANG: Have you ever felt depressed? Perhaps a bit blue? Did you ever have an existential crisis and start to question the very foundation of your faith?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Boen Wang</h4><p begin="00:09:55.64" data-timestamp="595.64"> I am raised in the church. I go to Sunday school, and worship service, and youth group, and Bible study, which I come to lead. Every break, I go to a retreat that's held at a camp near Lancaster, out in Amish country. When I'm 17, I make this promo video for our upcoming spring youth retreat.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Young Boen Wang</h4><p begin="00:10:15.20" data-timestamp="615.2">(SUBJECT) YOUNG BOEN WANG: Maybe you have doubts about your faith. Maybe you've been a Christian for many years, but you're still uncertain about some things. Maybe you're new to Christianity and have a lot of questions. Either way, you should take the opportunity to go to the spring youth retreat. Don't believe me? Just listen to these satisfied customers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Satisfied Customer</h4><p begin="00:10:34.19" data-timestamp="634.19"> At first, I wasn't too sure about this retreat thing, you know? I mean, like, people going to woods, singing, worshiping, isn't that what cults do? But then I went to it, and it was really interesting. We went singing, we worshipped. And it wasn't a cult at all. I mean, you should definitely go.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Boen Wang</h4><p begin="00:10:51.56" data-timestamp="651.56"> In retrospect, this sounds like a cry for help. I'm totally not trapped in a cult, haha. Being immersed for decades in this not-cult didn't just shape my behavior-- it rewired my brain. Like, even today, when I'm washing the dishes, I'll be thinking about how this Scrub Daddy that I'm using is falling apart. And I should probably get some new sponges from the supermarket.</p><p begin="00:11:12.81" data-timestamp="672.81">And Jesus Christ, remember that time at the food bazaar in Flatbush when I almost ran my shopping cart into that old lady, and she yelled at me? God, I'm such a worthless piece of shit. But anyway, I should probably go to Giant Eagle to get some sponges.</p><p begin="00:11:25.64" data-timestamp="685.64">And Jesus Christ, remember that time when I met up with the Arts Council guy at the 61C Cafe across the street from the Giant Eagle, and we said goodbye, but then we were walking the same way and awkwardly made more conversation until we reached his car? God, I'm such a worthless piece of shit.</p><p begin="00:11:40.49" data-timestamp="700.49">But anyway, I should email the landlord about how the dishwasher doesn't work so I don't have to hand wash these dishes. It hasn't worked this entire time. And Jesus Christ, it's been almost a year since I moved into this apartment, and I still haven't emailed him. God, why am I such a procrastinator? I'm such a worthless piece of shit.</p><p begin="00:11:57.96" data-timestamp="717.96">Sometimes I whisper it to myself. I'm a worthless piece of shit. I hate myself. This is the main thing I learned from Christianity, that I'm a worthless piece of shit. And listen, I know that that's not the main message of the Gospel. I know Jesus teaches us that we're redeemed by His sacrifice, that we're all children of God. But all that nice, feel-good stuff bounced right off of me.</p><p begin="00:12:22.30" data-timestamp="742.3">What was drilled into my mind and what I really internalized is that while I'm a child of God, I'm also a child of Adam, who ate the forbidden fruit offered to him by Eve and whose original sin I inherit. Christians remind you of it all the time. I was at a wedding where the groom's brother told the newlyweds they need to never forget that they're broken sinners-- at a celebration of the couple.</p><p begin="00:12:46.56" data-timestamp="766.56">So I learned to hate myself. I need to punish myself every moment of every waking hour of every day for my sinfulness, which morphs into a need to punish myself for anything I've ever done that's vaguely embarrassing. For years, I hated talking about myself because I hated myself. If I'm at a social event and meet someone new, I'll be like, so where do you live? How long have you been there for? How do you like it? Where are you from? What school did you go to?</p><p begin="00:13:13.01" data-timestamp="793.01">And if someone asks me a question, like what I do for a living, I'm like, oh, uh, well, you know, I make podcasts or whatever. It's stupid. And then I do rhetorical jujitsu and redirect back to the other person. What do you do for a living? How did you get into that? How do you like it?</p><p begin="00:13:28.27" data-timestamp="808.27">Humility is a big part of Christianity. The good are humble, quiet, and meek, while the evil are loud, boisterous, and proud. As Solomon teaches us in Proverbs, "When pride comes, then comes disgrace. But with humility comes wisdom."</p><p begin="00:13:44.89" data-timestamp="824.89">So if I don't want to disgrace myself, I need to make sure the attention is always on the other person. I need to stay humble and never answer anyone's questions about me. Because if I talk about myself, they'd soon discover my fundamental worthless piece of shit-ness and be as disgusted with me as I am with myself.</p><p begin="00:14:04.04" data-timestamp="844.04">Besides, who would want to talk to me in the first place? Who would possibly want to get to know me, befriend me, or, God forbid, date me? Sex was out of the question, even as an adult living on my own. As Jesus says in the Sermon on the Mount, anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. So not only is it immoral to have sex, to just think about sex is a sin.</p><p begin="00:14:30.47" data-timestamp="870.47">I held on to that even after I left the church and graduated college. I simply cannot imagine myself ever dating. When I thought about the future, I pictured myself getting frozen fish nuggets from Trader Joe's, frozen hash browns and tartar sauce from Giant Eagle, and eating them together as the saddest fish and chips in the world, while watching through all of <i>Twin</i> <i>Peaks,</i> which is what I did my first semester in grad school, living with Craigslist roommates in a single room in Pittsburgh.</p><p begin="00:14:57.69" data-timestamp="897.69">I read an interview in <i>The</i> <i>Cut</i> with a, quote, "58-year-old virgin," who said that the worst part about his life is, quote, "laying alone at night, falling asleep, and then getting up in the morning and remembering you're alone." I read that, and I was like, yep. All right, here we go.</p><p begin="00:15:16.38" data-timestamp="916.38">At age 25, I started dating my partner and now fiancée, Grace. They're the first person I ever dated. We saw the movie <i>Challengers</i> the other day, the horny Zendaya tennis movie about three tennis players who fuck each other while fucking each other over. On the drive back from the theater, Grace was like--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Grace</h4><p begin="00:15:35.13" data-timestamp="935.13"> Wow, the horny Zendaya tennis movie sure was horny, don't you think?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Boen Wang</h4><p begin="00:15:39.46" data-timestamp="939.46"> And I was like--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boen Wang</h4><p begin="00:15:40.53" data-timestamp="940.53"> Uh, well, I just really like the soundtrack by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross of Nine Inch Nails. They also did the music for <i>The</i> <i>Social</i> <i>Network</i> and <i>Gone</i> <i>Girl</i> and the <i>Watchmen</i> TV show.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Grace</h4><p begin="00:15:49.86" data-timestamp="949.86"> Right, but the movie was also, like, really horny, right? Did it make you horny?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boen Wang</h4><p begin="00:15:54.52" data-timestamp="954.52"> Uh, maybe. I don't know. It's just that Nine Inch Nails actually released an album of instrumentals in 2008 entirely through a Creative Commons license, so you don't have to pay any licensing fees. I actually used some of their songs in my podcasts.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Grace</h4><p begin="00:16:06.96" data-timestamp="966.96"> Boen, did the horny Zendaya tennis movie make you horny? Why are you being so immature about this?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Boen Wang</h4><p begin="00:16:15.48" data-timestamp="975.48"> I don't know what exactly happened in this moment, but I felt like a child. I felt swallowed by an overwhelming feeling of shame-- shame about sex, about sexual desire, and simply being a sexual being, for having a body. For a long time, I wish I didn't have a body, that I was a floating consciousness, freed from the shame and guilt of the flesh.</p><p begin="00:16:38.08" data-timestamp="998.08">It's been seven years since I left Christianity, but the effects are still there. These mental grooves are so well worn at this point, it's basically instinct. Where does my fucked up-ness come from? Well, I think I can trace all of this back to my dad at the Oklahoma City airport.</p><p begin="00:17:00.18" data-timestamp="1020.18">The story of my dad waiting for someone to pick him up at the airport has taken on an almost mythological significance to me, this moment that sealed my fate years before I even existed, because as he stood in the terminal, he also stood at a crossroads. Is there an alternate reality where Dave doesn't pick him up and someone else does instead, someone who isn't a Christian, and my dad never converts, and my life is so much better as a result?</p><p begin="00:17:28.62" data-timestamp="1048.62">I was born in Oklahoma and moved away when I was two. I have no memories of living there or of Dave. What was it about this place and these people that made my parents choose Christianity? If I went there myself, if I talked to Dave and the people who knew them, visited the places they spent time in, attended the church they worshipped at, and tried to imagine what their lives were like 35 years ago, maybe then I could finally understand why things went the way they did.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Boen Wang</h4><p begin="00:17:59.80" data-timestamp="1079.8"> OK, I am standing in the Oklahoma City airport. I had this idea where I would stand where my dad stood, looking around for someone to pick him up. But I don't know exactly where that would be. Mostly I'm just tired and want to lay in a bed. I think I'll go do that.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:18:26.25" data-timestamp="1106.25"> Rolling my suitcase across the parking lot, I think about how my dad flew in from Beijing as an "alien," to use the official terminology, while I arrived from Pittsburgh as a US citizen. How my dad was at the mercy of strangers for transportation, while I have a license and rental car.</p><p begin="00:18:43.29" data-timestamp="1123.29">How I would now retrace the route my dad took from Oklahoma City to Norman, and how the one thing we share is a sense of exhaustion, of wanting nothing more than a warm bed in a private room at the end of a long day in a strange place.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>The Flaming Lips</h4><p begin="00:18:59.07" data-timestamp="1139.07">(SUBJECT) THE FLAMING LIPS: 1, 2, 3, 4</p><p begin="00:19:02.44" data-timestamp="1142.44">["DO YOU REALIZE??"

Dave worked as a campus minister in colleges across the US and the world, in Nebraska and Maryland and Nairobi, Kenya. But he spent the bulk of his career ministering to Chinese international students at OU, as the University of Oklahoma is confusingly nicknamed, starting in 1987, two years before my parents arrived.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Boen Wang</h4><p begin="00:25:38.79" data-timestamp="1538.79"> Did you have any sort of prior knowledge of China or Chinese culture or the language or anything like that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:25:46.61" data-timestamp="1546.61"> Well, [CLEARS THROAT] no.

He saw a new population at OU, many of whom were already curious about Western culture and Christianity, and he was happy to oblige. It was clarifying for me to learn that Dave had been a missionary in Kenya. I've come to think of him as a sort of domestic missionary, serving people from outside the US, within the US.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:26:27.23" data-timestamp="1587.23"> I think it's somewhere close to 450 Chinese-- closer, maybe, even to 500 during that time over the years, say.

My dad got on his knees, prayed to accept Jesus into his heart.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:27:09.76" data-timestamp="1629.76"> And then your dad looked up and smiled.

But then, when I go to him in person, I resolve to tell him the full truth. Dave is in an assisted living facility now. In the lobby, I meet his son and daughter-in-law, who had asked that I not record the conversation.</p><p begin="00:28:52.81" data-timestamp="1732.81">Dave had fallen recently and broken a vertebrae. He sits in an armchair in his room and wears a neck brace. If he sneezes or laughs too hard, he can hurt himself. After a softball question, I forced myself to come clean. I'm no longer Christian. How does he feel about people he tried to lead to Christ who either didn't believe or later left?</p><p begin="00:29:16.57" data-timestamp="1756.57">Dave smiles. He asks if I'd heard the story of the prodigal son. It's a classic, one of Jesus's most famous parables, where a failson disobeys his dad and later returns to him, penitent and willing to accept any punishment. But instead, his dad forgives him and welcomes him home. Dave then explains that he has a daughter who left the church. In high school, she angrily confronted Dave with tears in her eyes and told him, Dad, please apologize to me for being a Christian.</p><p begin="00:29:49.50" data-timestamp="1789.5">I think I understand what she meant by that. It's a way of saying, apologize for making this decision for me, for raising me with this belief I didn't choose and that I don't agree with. In a sense, I'm asking him the same thing-- Yeye, why did you convert my parents?</p><p begin="00:30:07.70" data-timestamp="1807.7">His daughter left the faith. Dave didn't try to convince her of anything, just kept loving her and praying for her. And after 20 years, she, like the prodigal son, returned to the faith and to her father. These days, she visits him every week in the assisted living facility.</p><p begin="00:30:24.89" data-timestamp="1824.89">Dave emphasizes again that he never forced anyone to believe anything, that if someone chooses to reject Christianity, they need to be loved, whatever their decision is. But he also tells me, there will be nobody going to hell who didn't have an opportunity to accept Christ. He says it in a way that isn't angry or spiteful-- just sad, almost kind.</p><p begin="00:30:48.62" data-timestamp="1848.62">It's getting late. Dave needs to take his medication. We stand up. I love you, he tells me. Give my love to your parents. We hug. And I get it. I get why my parents converted. This man is filled with so much love and gives it so freely-- to my parents, to me, to all of the people he picked up from the airport and fed and sheltered and helped get on their feet.</p><p begin="00:31:15.38" data-timestamp="1875.38">Where does his love come from? In the moment, I'm convinced that it must be something beyond what any human is capable of. It must come from God. On the receiving end of his unconditional love, I consider being the prodigal son. For the briefest flash of a moment, I consider returning.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:31:36.01" data-timestamp="1896.01"> Can I pray for you?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Boen Wang</h4><p begin="00:31:37.49" data-timestamp="1897.49"> When we were on the phone, this is how Dave ended the call.

I spoke to one of the new white Daves over the phone, who told me that I could record the service. But a few days later, while I was cooking butternut squash risotto, he called again and told me he had found a podcast called <i>Jesus</i> <i>Wept.</i></p><p begin="00:33:15.89" data-timestamp="1995.89">[JESUS WEPT THEME MUSIC]</p><p begin="00:33:20.79" data-timestamp="2000.79"><i>Jesus</i> <i>Wept</i> is a podcast my fiancée Grace and I make, where we analyze and, to be honest, make fun of various topics related to evangelical Christianity. We process our respective religious traumas through humor. In the most recent episode, I went to a Chinese church and recorded the service.</p><p begin="00:33:39.37" data-timestamp="2019.37">Afterwards, Grace and I critiqued the speakers and-- again, to be honest-- made fun of them.

In the podcast, I talk about how I don't believe in God.</p><p begin="00:34:39.10" data-timestamp="2079.1">And as we wrap up the conversation, New Dave says he needs my word that I won't record anything.

I shake his hand and tell him I'm not recording-- that was a royalty-free sound effect from freesound.org-- although I do have the pink notebook I'd bought from Target for $3. We walk past an armed guard to the gymnasium, where the Mandarin Sunday school is held. It seems notable that the Mandarin Sunday school isn't in a dedicated classroom, but an echoey gym with a basketball court.</p><p begin="00:35:30.20" data-timestamp="2130.2">New Dave introduces me to a group of Chinese immigrants sitting around a folding table. They ask if I can speak Chinese. I say I can understand it OK, but not speak it that well. New Dave is like, ah, there's that phrase, ABC.</p><p begin="00:35:43.82" data-timestamp="2143.82">[ORIENTAL RIFF]</p><p begin="00:35:45.29" data-timestamp="2145.29">And I'm like, yep, that's me, American Born Chinese.

Where else could they find a Chinese community in a small town in Oklahoma? Someone later tells me that this church is usually the first stop for new Chinese immigrants. People from church are willing to give rides to the supermarket, furniture for apartments, help with taxes, and all sorts of essential services.

Maybe Christianity is just my excuse to hate myself. It gave my self-loathing a shape and structure, but it isn't the root cause. Maybe I would have hated myself no matter what.</p><p begin="00:38:01.87" data-timestamp="2281.87">Maybe it doesn't matter what path my dad chose at that crossroads in the Oklahoma City airport. If he never met Dave and never believed, maybe I'd still have the same self-loathing. If I grew up communist like my parents, maybe I'd be like, ugh, I'm such a bourgeois, capitalist, worthless piece of shit. I need to write another self-criticism and do another struggle session.</p><p begin="00:38:24.04" data-timestamp="2304.04">Thankfully, I can answer the question of whether I'd hate myself if I hadn't been raised Christian by comparing myself with my high school friend, Andrew. Andrew grew up in the same suburb of Philly as me. His parents are highly-educated Chinese immigrants. We attended the same school district and have the same circle of friends. But he was raised by atheist parents who were never interested in Christianity or church.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew</h4><p begin="00:38:50.07" data-timestamp="2330.07"> I asked my mom one time.

Andrew has lived the life I always imagined-- a life without church or youth group or Bible study or retreats near Lancaster, out in Amish country.

Does he not like himself?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew</h4><p begin="00:39:34.06" data-timestamp="2374.06"> I don't like myself.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Boen Wang</h4><p begin="00:39:35.22" data-timestamp="2375.22"> OK, all right.

She will always be thankful to the people from church who helped her get on her feet, in the same way that I want to be clear that I'll always be thankful to my parents.

She had raised questions about the Bible. Like, if God created everything, why did He also create Satan? Why would He allow Satan to tempt Eve into eating the forbidden fruit? Why would He even create forbidden fruit in the first place? No one at church would ever fully engage with her. They'd give her surface-level platitudes that never satisfied her.</p><p begin="00:47:46.29" data-timestamp="2866.29">There was also a period when she was depressed.

Who knew?</p><p begin="00:50:25.36" data-timestamp="3025.36">I wasn't surprised that my dad gave in to my mom, though. When it comes down to it, he puts family first. I asked him once if he ever had any regrets, and he told me the story about how, when my sister was a baby, he discovered that she had torn up an important piece of mail. My dad yelled at her and made her cry, and then he thought to himself, why did I do that? She's just a baby. She doesn't understand what she's doing. And he remembered that moment forever.</p><p begin="00:50:52.81" data-timestamp="3052.81">So he's always been a kind, thoughtful, reflective person who wants the best for us.
