OK, let's call the ORR parent hotline.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:13.46" data-timestamp="73.46"> What is that, the ORR parent hotline?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:01:15.77" data-timestamp="75.77"> So, that's the phone number that you're supposed to call, either as a parent or as an attorney, to try to locate your child. I mean, it's really the most-- when you look at this flyer, it's the most useful piece of information on it. So yeah, this is the number that Rochelle's about to call.</p><p begin="00:01:33.87" data-timestamp="93.87">[PHONE RINGING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:01:34.36" data-timestamp="94.36"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:01:39.28" data-timestamp="99.28"> So it starts in Spanish, and then it switches to English.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:01:42.17" data-timestamp="102.17"> You have reached the ORR national call center, open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

And I haven't been contacted, and neither has my client.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan</h4><p begin="00:02:59.19" data-timestamp="179.19"> OK. What's the name of the minor?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:03:02.37" data-timestamp="182.37"> So she gives the name of this girl to the operator and he looks her up and finds her in the system.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan</h4><p begin="00:03:07.69" data-timestamp="187.69"> What I can do is to try to do-- try to send the shelter inquiry again. I mean, because they usually do contact. But right now, with the high volume of minors that are entering the United States, it's a little complicated for them.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:26.66" data-timestamp="206.66"> Hey Kevin, when he says the high volume of minors entering the United States, is that what's happening?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:03:32.12" data-timestamp="212.12"> No. I mean, there is no surge of minors crossing the border. In fact, there are fewer people crossing the border than almost any time in the last decade. What there's a surge of is a surge of families being separated, and that's what's changed.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:45.74" data-timestamp="225.74"> And that's why he's getting so many calls.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:03:47.27" data-timestamp="227.27"> Right. There are children and parents who can't find each other.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rochelle Garza</h4><p begin="00:03:51.53" data-timestamp="231.53"> Maybe there's a better way for us to do this. Can I send a letter to you or to the shelter somehow, saying that I'm representing her father? That way I can at least confirm, you know, where she is and so I can go ahead and start working on her case.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan</h4><p begin="00:04:12.07" data-timestamp="252.07"> OK. For that-- so basically, we don't release that information of the shelter. We can't release that information to the public.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:24.55" data-timestamp="264.55"> We don't release the information saying what shelter she's in, is what he's saying, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:04:28.46" data-timestamp="268.46"> Right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan</h4><p begin="00:04:29.28" data-timestamp="269.28"> Due to safety concerns, safety purposes. But I mean, I can type out a little bit of, like, whatever you want to tell them, tell the shelter, and I can make sure they get the message if that'll work for you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rochelle Garza</h4><p begin="00:04:44.84" data-timestamp="284.84"> Yeah, no. I guess I'm just trying to figure out a way that I can explain that I'm an attorney and that I'm the attorney assisting the parent. And the parent has asked me to locate the child. So that way, I can speak with her. Is there any email address that I can maybe send a letter of representation to? Even if it's to someone at your office.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan</h4><p begin="00:05:11.85" data-timestamp="311.85"> Give me one second.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:05:13.94" data-timestamp="313.94"> I think that's one of the fundamental problems here, is that they're making it really hard for her to establish that she is, in fact, representing a child.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan</h4><p begin="00:05:20.84" data-timestamp="320.84"> And is the parent in the detention center?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rochelle Garza</h4><p begin="00:05:25.31" data-timestamp="325.31"> Yes. I think you can probably see that in your system, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan</h4><p begin="00:05:30.77" data-timestamp="330.77"> I can try to find them. But--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rochelle Garza</h4><p begin="00:05:33.14" data-timestamp="333.14"> Do you want me to--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan</h4><p begin="00:05:34.21" data-timestamp="334.21"> I was just asking so that--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rochelle Garza</h4><p begin="00:05:35.54" data-timestamp="335.54"> Do you want me to confirm his name?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan</h4><p begin="00:05:37.19" data-timestamp="337.19"> Huh?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rochelle Garza</h4><p begin="00:05:37.61" data-timestamp="337.61"> Do you want me to confirm the dad's name? I can give that to you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan</h4><p begin="00:05:40.24" data-timestamp="340.24"> No, it's OK. No, I only have the information for the minors. I don't have the-- for the adults. I mean, I can't go to the ICE locator and find them, but--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:50.65" data-timestamp="350.65"> This surprised me. Is he saying that his database lists the child and where the child is, but doesn't have the parent's name attached to that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:06:00.04" data-timestamp="360.04"> Yeah. I mean, he's telling Rochelle that he has no record of even that parent's name, let alone where that parent's located. I mean, and this, I think, is the biggest concern that lawyers have right now is, is there even a record in a government database of which child belongs to which parent? We don't know the answer to that question. But there are a lot of reasons, including this exchange, that would make us think that they don't. They don't know.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:24.06" data-timestamp="384.06"> So again, so in the recording, he then heads off to try to answer her question about how can she get through to the daughter.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan</h4><p begin="00:06:29.54" data-timestamp="389.54"> OK, I mean, just give me one second so I can speak to my supervisor about this. Let me ask what else I can do for you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rochelle Garza</h4><p begin="00:06:38.57" data-timestamp="398.57"> OK. Thank you, I appreciate that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan</h4><p begin="00:06:40.74" data-timestamp="400.74"> Do you mind holding on--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rochelle Garza</h4><p begin="00:06:42.19" data-timestamp="402.19"> I do not mind.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan</h4><p begin="00:06:42.92" data-timestamp="402.92"> --for a little bit? Thank you.</p><p begin="00:06:45.51" data-timestamp="405.51">[MUSIC PLAYING]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:46.79" data-timestamp="406.79"> Kevin, so on his computer screen he actually has the information that she wants, of where this girl is?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:06:52.91" data-timestamp="412.91"> Yeah, that's basically what he's saying, that he has it. He knows where she is, but he can't give it to her.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:59.03" data-timestamp="419.03"> Now eventually, as this call goes on, the guy gives her an email address. But then it's just the same email address that's on the form that she has, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:07:07.76" data-timestamp="427.76"> Yeah. Yeah, and I mean, I kind of saw her just entirely deflated after he gave that address.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:07:16.21" data-timestamp="436.21"> Right, so having had it, how do you feel about that call?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rochelle Garza</h4><p begin="00:07:21.36" data-timestamp="441.36"> Not very good.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:07:23.70" data-timestamp="443.7"> Why?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rochelle Garza</h4><p begin="00:07:27.25" data-timestamp="447.25"> I mean, they're not really trying to help. Yeah. Sorry, it's rough. I just don't know how we're going to track down these kids. That's not helpful. I mean, I can still go through the motions of sending an email to that email address, but I just don't have any faith that it's going to go anywhere.</p><p begin="00:07:58.97" data-timestamp="478.97">Sorry, I'm getting emotional. But it's very frustrating. And I can only imagine what's going on on her end.</p><p begin="00:08:06.63" data-timestamp="486.63"></p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:11.37" data-timestamp="491.37"> OK, so that was a week ago. What's happened since?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:08:14.85" data-timestamp="494.85"> So, Rochelle reached out to one of the legal service providers who work with children who are detained after crossing the border. And these are organizations that represent children through their deportation proceedings, through their asylum hearings. And these organizations keep track of the kids that they're working with.</p><p begin="00:08:31.83" data-timestamp="511.83">They each have a list of the kids. And Rochelle kind of got lucky, and the person she reached out to did actually have a record of this girl and was able to tell Rochelle where the girl was being held.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:43.41" data-timestamp="523.41"> She found the name of the shelter?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:08:44.82" data-timestamp="524.82"> She found the shelter, yeah. So then the next step was for her to get to the shelter to try to set up basically an appointment. So on Thursday afternoon, she drove to the shelter. And she walked in and there the girl was. I talked to her right afterwards.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rochelle Garza</h4><p begin="00:09:04.32" data-timestamp="544.32"> She looked like her dad, so I recognized her right away. I felt-- I felt really emotional about it actually, when I saw her, just because I could see her dad's face in her face. I had to-- obviously, any time you go and you introduce yourself to a child, like they don't know who you are. I obviously explained my relationship to her dad and to her and that I've been looking for her.</p><p begin="00:09:37.29" data-timestamp="577.29">And her eyes turned really red when I mentioned her dad. And I asked her if she wanted to write him a letter and she was like, yes. And so she frantically wrote this letter, and I gave her the time to do that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:56.95" data-timestamp="596.95"> And so this girl, she's 12 years old. What did Rochelle say? Is she doing OK?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:10:02.19" data-timestamp="602.19"> Yeah, the girl's doing OK. Rochelle said she looks healthy. She's wearing a uniform given to her, a sort of polo shirt given to her by the shelter. And she was wearing a bunch of friendship bracelets that I guess she's learned to make there. And then Rochelle had to do this thing, which is explain that this girl probably is not going to see her dad any time soon, and she might not even talk to him any time soon.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rochelle Garza</h4><p begin="00:10:23.09" data-timestamp="623.09"> The way you explain it is, like, you kind of have to explain what's going on in the national realm, right? You have to say there was this executive order and there was this decision out of the courts, and put it in that kind of context so that-- I mean the thing is, I don't have an answer for her, Kevin. Like, I can't tell her, you're for sure going to get a phone call this day. You're for sure going to be reunited with him on this day. All I can say is, I don't know.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:54.33" data-timestamp="654.33"> Kevin, I thought the policy had changed. Like, the president announced that we are no longer separating families from children. And in fact, the government announced that they had reunited over 500 children.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:11:05.00" data-timestamp="665"> Yeah, I mean, the government has made these announcements about their plans to reunify families. But when you talk to the lawyers who are representing the parents, nothing has changed at all. And in many cases, not only are the families not reunified, but these lawyers still can't figure out where the children are being held.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:22.27" data-timestamp="682.27"> And what do we know about the 500-plus kids who the government says they reunited?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:11:27.19" data-timestamp="687.19"> I mean, the government has said that they've reunited these families. When I talk to lawyers who are representing hundreds of parents-- I mean, there's one organization that's representing 376, another that's representing I think over 400 now. I haven't heard of a single-- at least as of a few days ago, I haven't heard of a single reunification.</p><p begin="00:11:46.25" data-timestamp="706.25">So I mean, I think in the absence of concrete information about who these families were, how they were reunified, lawyers are really wondering if these kids were among the 2,300 who were separated from their parents. If maybe they were from a different pool of children. It's possible that the government numbers are accurate, but there are just so many questions about them, because there's really no documentation that goes along with it.</p><p begin="00:12:11.83" data-timestamp="731.83"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:17.27" data-timestamp="737.27"> We reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for clarification about all of this, and a spokesperson told us that the 539 children they've said were reunited with parents were all apprehended since May, as part of the administration's zero tolerance policy, and they all were in border patrol custody before being returned to their families. Presumably, being in border patrol custody means they were only in the country a short time and had never been transferred to other agencies, shelters, and foster homes. The spokesperson declined to provide any names of these families or any information about what countries they were from.</p><p begin="00:12:49.45" data-timestamp="769.45">But this kind of situation where somebody-- in this case, the President of the United States-- declares that he's changed-- it's all different, he's moving on, no longer separating kids from their parents, but the result is not so clear. That situation, that is what our show is about today. Something happens, maybe you'd like to believe it's true, but you don't know if you should.</p><p begin="00:13:13.01" data-timestamp="793.01">We have a bunch of different stories that do not involve the current administration, or any previous ones. One of the stories, in fact, takes us into a noisy world of half-clad soap opera stars and daytime TV hosts, none of whom I bet you have ever heard of. Stay with us.</p><p begin="00:13:28.05" data-timestamp="808.05"></p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One: The All-Too-Real Housewives of Argentina</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:35.86" data-timestamp="815.86"> Act One, The All Too Real Housewives of Argentina. There's an old saying, don't believe everything you see. But there's a corollary, of course-- don't believe everything you see on TV, especially daytime TV. And it doesn't matter what country you're in. Jasmine Garsd grew up in Argentina and has this story.</p><p begin="00:13:54.64" data-timestamp="834.64">Quick warning before we start-- the stories in today's show have some curse words that we have un-beeped here in the podcast version of the show. If you want a version with beeps, maybe you're listening with kids, go to our website. And here's Jasmine.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jasmine Garsd</h4><p begin="00:14:05.86" data-timestamp="845.86"> I watched a lot of television when I was a kid. My grandmother, Iaia, would pick me up at school and bring me back to her place. Her apartment was dark and humid. It smelled like French bread and the exhaust from the buses on the avenue down below. My grandfather was never around.</p><p begin="00:14:23.07" data-timestamp="863.07">Iaia would make tea and then we would go to her bedroom and turn the TV on. And suddenly, colors, sound, and sex would pour into the world. It was the early afternoon. It was time for the talk shows.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:14:34.70" data-timestamp="874.7"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p><p begin="00:14:37.40" data-timestamp="877.4"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jasmine Garsd</h4><p begin="00:14:38.89" data-timestamp="878.89"> Argentine talk shows are extreme, even for Latin American television. The women are pumped up with silicone and Botox, and sometimes show up wearing almost nothing. The conversation is not just double entendres, but straight up entendres, full-on vulgar language. When I was growing up, it was a parade of pasties, stilettos, feather boas.</p><p begin="00:15:00.37" data-timestamp="900.37">One of the most popular shows back then was hosted by a guy named Jorge Rial. He's still on TV. He's kind of the Argentine everyman-- charming and a little bit of a hustler. These days, his TV show is called <i>Intrusos,</i> or <i>Intruders.</i></p><p begin="00:15:15.82" data-timestamp="915.82">It takes place on a set that is just seizure inducing-- neon colors, walls lined with giant video screens. Jorge Rial likes to stir up fights among his voluptuous guests. Every time something shocking is said, ominous music rolls out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:15:31.27" data-timestamp="931.27"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p><p begin="00:15:32.61" data-timestamp="932.61">[OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING]</p><p begin="00:15:35.26" data-timestamp="935.26"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jasmine Garsd</h4><p begin="00:15:36.80" data-timestamp="936.8"> Once in a while, a woman is so sexy that Jorge Rial bites his lower lip and mugs for the camera. This has been Rial's style for years. Back in the day, Iaia would bring the tea and cookies and lie down next to me in her patent leather platform shoes, which she never took off, not even in bed. My grandmother was the target audience for Rial's show, what's commonly known as "doña rosa," a housewife.</p><p begin="00:16:02.07" data-timestamp="962.07">She loved to hate the show, to look disapprovingly at the women and comment how much surgery she's had. "Una prostituta," a prostitute. "una loca." And they give her expensive gifts-- cars, vacations. And I'd look around me my grandmother's lonely apartment and think to myself, wow. That sounds pretty amazing. I knew I didn't want to be a doña rosa when I grew up.</p><p begin="00:16:29.17" data-timestamp="989.17"></p><p begin="00:16:34.87" data-timestamp="994.87">When I was a teenager, I moved to the US and eventually became a journalist. I've lived here for 15 years. Sometimes when I get homesick, I stream <i>Intrusos</i> on YouTube. I leave it on when I cook and clean. When I watch it, I'm not 5,000 miles away. Iaia is alive, nothing has changed much. Nothing ever changes on Argentine daytime TV. Until suddenly, a few months ago, it did.</p><p begin="00:17:00.75" data-timestamp="1020.75">[MUSIC PLAYING]</p><p begin="00:17:03.19" data-timestamp="1023.19"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:17:08.07" data-timestamp="1028.07"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jasmine Garsd</h4><p begin="00:17:12.35" data-timestamp="1032.35"> One night in February, I was at home in New York cleaning my kitchen. <i>Intrusos</i> was on in the background and I heard this woman with a raspy Lauren Bacall voice. I turned around, soapy sponge in hand, and squinted at the screen-- a tattooed, heavyset woman wearing sneakers.</p><p begin="00:17:30.18" data-timestamp="1050.18">I recognized this woman, a comedian named Senorita Bimbo. The stage name, Bimbo, is ironic. She's anything but. In fact, the very next thing she did was look directly into the camera and offer a statistic about illegal abortions.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Senorita Bimbo</h4><p begin="00:17:45.59" data-timestamp="1065.59"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p><p begin="00:17:48.84" data-timestamp="1068.84"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jasmine Garsd</h4><p begin="00:17:50.29" data-timestamp="1070.29"> "500,000 women in Argentina have illegal abortions every year," she said. She was wearing a bright green handkerchief around her neck, a provocative symbol everyone in Argentina knows-- the symbol of the fight to legalize abortion. For years, activists have been pushing to get Congress to vote on it.</p><p begin="00:18:09.78" data-timestamp="1089.78">When I was growing up, abortion was something you just didn't talk about in Argentina, a Catholic country. It's still not something that comes up on daytime TV. Reproductive rights? That's just not <i>Intrusos</i> material. Though here was Jorge Rial, the host, looking intently at Senorita Bimbo.</p><p begin="00:18:28.85" data-timestamp="1108.85"></p><p begin="00:18:32.35" data-timestamp="1112.35">A few hours later, one of my best friends texted me, "Did you watch <i>Intrusos</i> today?" I sat down at my laptop and started scrolling through the descriptions of the last few episodes. The guests were names I knew-- academics, writers, comedians. What they had in common was, they were all feminists, people who have been on the fringes for years, criticizing sexism in Argentina and demanding women's rights.</p><p begin="00:18:56.44" data-timestamp="1136.44">I started binge watching. In each episode, there was a nuanced conversation about feminism. Rial looked kind of meek, but not in his usual, "I've been overpowered by sexy ladies" way. He kept delivering these really impassioned monologues saying, I don't want to be a misogynist, a "machista." I'm a recovering machista.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jorge Rial</h4><p begin="00:19:17.43" data-timestamp="1157.43"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p><p begin="00:19:19.01" data-timestamp="1159.01"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jasmine Garsd</h4><p begin="00:19:23.78" data-timestamp="1163.78"> The Argentine everyman now appeared to be an earnest feminist.

I had a really hard time wrapping my head around the fact that, for 18 years, she had been behind this totally trashy and objectifying show. Ana Laura told me, it's just a job, one she's good at.

I had no idea this was possible. Right now on <i>Intrusos,</i> there's a fight between a former cabaret dancer and a potential candidate for president.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jasmine Garsd</h4><p begin="00:20:48.88" data-timestamp="1248.88"> This, like, skyrocketed.

This is doing better than the news.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:21:00.51" data-timestamp="1260.51"> Next segment, a fashion model from the '80s says she has her suspicions about a designer's recent death.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jasmine Garsd</h4><p begin="00:21:07.62" data-timestamp="1267.62"> It dipped to 3.4.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:21:11.05" data-timestamp="1271.05"> The ratings plummet.

There are a gazillion gossip shows in Argentina. It's like this whole universe. Back in January, one of the shows interviewed this famous singer, a leathery guy in a tropical shirt. In the middle of the interview, the singer casually repeats this awful saying I used to hear as a kid-- if someone wants to rape you, relax and enjoy it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:21:52.70" data-timestamp="1312.7"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jasmine Garsd</h4><p begin="00:21:57.08" data-timestamp="1317.08"> The first time I heard that was when I was nine years old. I was in the locker room and a girl blurted it out. I thought it was advice. A lot of my friends did, too.</p><p begin="00:22:07.29" data-timestamp="1327.29">So the singer says this offensive thing. A few days later, on another talk show, a soap opera star blows up about it. Her name is Araceli Gonzales.</p><p begin="00:22:16.87" data-timestamp="1336.87">When I was a kid, her soap opera was huge. She played a mute. A hunk with feathered hair would talk at her while she listened tearfully. But now she wasn't mute. She said the singer's remark made her sick.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Araceli Gonzales</h4><p begin="00:22:30.01" data-timestamp="1350.01"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jasmine Garsd</h4><p begin="00:22:33.91" data-timestamp="1353.91"> It was kind of beautiful seeing her get angry after so many years of playing a character literally defined by silence. Ana Laura, from <i>Intrusos,</i> saw the fight happening on TV and she wanted to get a piece of it. She booked Araceli to come on the show.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:22:49.34" data-timestamp="1369.34"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p><p begin="00:22:53.26" data-timestamp="1373.26">It was a typical day on <i>Intrusos.</i> Jorge Rial talked about how much granny panties used to turn him on as a kid. Two former showgirls argued. And then it was Araceli's turn. And just because Araceli had gotten mad about the rape comment, one of the panelists introduces her as a feminist. As soon as Araceli got a chance, she corrected him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Araceli Gonzales</h4><p begin="00:23:13.06" data-timestamp="1393.06"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jasmine Garsd</h4><p begin="00:23:16.90" data-timestamp="1396.9"> She says, "I heard you refer to me as a feminist just now, and I am not a feminist."

And we saw that feminists started to respond. So everything exploded.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jasmine Garsd</h4><p begin="00:23:54.22" data-timestamp="1434.22"> There were the kinds of tweets you would expect like, quote, "What the fuck does loving your husband and son have to do with being a feminist, you moron?" And here it was, feminists versus the soap opera star, a fight made for daytime television.</p><p begin="00:24:08.58" data-timestamp="1448.58">And Ana Laura knew it. And she also knew Jorge Rial, the host of the show-- something had been changing with him lately.

And even she'll tell you she's a safe bet for a show like <i>Intrusos.</i> She's thin and blonde. So Flor gets invited to <i>Intrusos</i> and the very first question Jorge Rial asks her is, what is feminism?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jorge Rial</h4><p begin="00:24:57.41" data-timestamp="1497.41"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Flor Freijo</h4><p begin="00:25:01.42" data-timestamp="1501.42"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Flor Freijo</h4><p begin="00:25:04.83" data-timestamp="1504.83"> I didn't prepare anything.

Against a neon fizz background, Flor Freijo does a feminism 101. At the bottom of the screen, a banner in bold letters reads, "Feminism-- it's a movement for women's rights." Flor starts explaining, feminism is a movement for women's rights. It started in the 19th century. It has to do with the division of labor, child rearing. Jorge Rial is listening, completely mesmerized, his little eyebrows furrowed, scratching his beard. And while all this is happening, Ana Laura is sitting in the control room upstairs, watching everything, of course-- and also keeping her eye on the ratings monitor. The control room is usually a chaotic mess of yelling, but now, with Flor speaking--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ana Laura</h4><p begin="00:26:04.78" data-timestamp="1564.78"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p><p begin="00:26:06.61" data-timestamp="1566.61"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:26:08.31" data-timestamp="1568.31"> And when we were watching her talking, Flor, the control room went quiet.

We were really like, silently watching and learning from her.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jasmine Garsd</h4><p begin="00:26:23.82" data-timestamp="1583.82"> And then the spell is broken because the phone rings in the control room. It's Araceli, the soap opera star who's the whole reason Flora's here. She wants to talk to Flor live, right now.

Instead she tells Flor, I've been listening really well to what you're saying. And she wanted the audience to know that she didn't know what feminism was until just now, when she was watching TV and saw Flor explain it.</p><p begin="00:27:13.05" data-timestamp="1633.05">She starts telling the story of her life through various generations of women, her own single mother and herself. She talks about how she had been sexually abused as a child and emotionally abused as an adult. And Araceli told Flor, I know what you're talking about and I agree with you.

By the way, this is never how <i>Intrusos</i> finishes. People don't just listen to each other and change their minds. And the ratings-- Ana Laura says the ratings were great, strong enough that she decided, let's do this again tomorrow.

Someone tweeted, "My ideology is starting to converge with Jorge Rial's, and that terrifies me." It was pretty strange for everyone. This very misogynistic show had suddenly become like, the public town hall on feminism in Argentina. And the ratings were not just good. Ana Laura says they were higher than normal.

So in a continent where abortion is mostly banned, women take it if they want to miscarry. People call it the DIY abortion. She's talking about doing something illegal on one of the most popular daytime talk shows, watched by housewives. That same day, misoprostol was one of the most Googled words in the country.

They pointed to how late he is to the whole feminism thing. He's a Johnny come lately. He's only doing this because it will make him more popular. After days of giving me the runaround, he told me to just send my questions. And finally, on my very last night in Argentina, my phone lit up.

These days, it's a mix of fighting starlets and women's rights activists. Jorge Rial's social media is a mix of World Cup woes, celebrity gossip, and then these really earnest feminist tweets.</p><p begin="00:36:18.18" data-timestamp="2178.18">Like this one a few weeks ago-- "They came to make things better for the coming generations, for our daughters and their daughters, and also for men.

Still, outside Congress, thousands of women and activists who'd gathered to wait for the results celebrated wildly.</p><p begin="00:37:01.98" data-timestamp="2221.98">Every time I spoke to those women about what role television like <i>Intrusos</i> played in all this, they got uncomfortable. On my last day in Argentina I grabbed a coffee with an old friend from high school, Jordana Timerman. She recently wrote an op-ed for the <i>New</i> <i>York</i> <i>Times</i> about the push to legalize abortion in Argentina, and we talked about the role pop culture played in that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jordana Timerman</h4><p begin="00:37:22.47" data-timestamp="2242.47"> You need to have people like Rial, or pop culture, doña rosa, understanding that this is a necessary right.

For a while, one of the local radio stations, 105.3, would warn people whenever Collins was on duty. This one time, they did a special show-- call in and tell us your Corrupt Collins story.

I was in a black Impala SS. This is actually like a race car. He was next to me in a Ford Taurus, which is a putt-putt to me. Then when I was at the stop light, I looked over at him. He looked over at me. And then when I turned, he just jumped straight behind me.

And Rob's like, I'm not stopping. Instead, he says, he just keeps driving, under the speed limit with Collins following him, lights and sirens on.

I'm just worried about him planting something. Y'all watch him and make sure he don't plant nothing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:46:02.96" data-timestamp="2762.96"> Rob went to jail that day. Not for drugs-- Collins didn't find any. But he arrested Rob anyway for fleeing and eluding. Rob didn't do much time, a couple of days, bonded out $3,000. But he did get convicted. In Michigan, fleeing and eluding is a felony. It's still on his record.</p><p begin="00:46:23.33" data-timestamp="2783.33">This other guy, Quacy Roberts, suffered more. In 2008, Quacy was leaving his girlfriend's house, hot summer day, when Collins and his partner pulled up. The partner said he'd seen Quacy throw something. Collins patted Quacy down while his partner walked around the block.</p><p begin="00:46:40.44" data-timestamp="2800.44">The partner came back and waved a baggie of crack in Quacy's face. Quacy says it wasn't his, but he ended up serving a year in jail. It was a terrible year to be in jail. He and his girlfriend were about to have a baby. The baby didn't make it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Quacy Roberts</h4><p begin="00:46:54.58" data-timestamp="2814.58"> When you have a stillborn, it's really a person. You got to go through all those stages, name it, get a social security number and everything. You got to go through everything. It's a person. You got to bury it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:47:05.21" data-timestamp="2825.21"> He still thinks about the baby.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Quacy Roberts</h4><p begin="00:47:07.63" data-timestamp="2827.63"> Yes, because he was mine.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:47:13.97" data-timestamp="2833.97"> Quacy couldn't be with his girlfriend for any of that. He had to hear about it through the prison phone. Not long after that, his girlfriend met someone else. So he's pretty angry at Collins.</p><p begin="00:47:24.71" data-timestamp="2844.71">Quacy's seen those news stories too. His mom called him once and told him to turn on the Megyn Kelly show, one of those stories with Andrew Collins and Jameel McGee, the guy who forgave him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Quacy Roberts</h4><p begin="00:47:34.52" data-timestamp="2854.52"> It's good that McGee smiling about everything. He must didn't lose nobody. He blessed. I guess he blessed.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:47:44.55" data-timestamp="2864.55"> He's blessed?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Quacy Roberts</h4><p begin="00:47:45.44" data-timestamp="2865.44"> Yeah, I guess he did four years and didn't lose nobody. I did a year and lost a son. So I'm-- I think an Andrew Collins interview with me would be-- I won't be showing no teeth for grinning at him. Maybe if I wouldn't have lost my child, maybe I'd be smiling too.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:48:07.68" data-timestamp="2887.68"> Quacy hasn't seen Collins since he went to jail, so Quacy never got an apology. But he thinks he deserves one. I asked if he wanted to meet with Collins. He said yeah.</p><p begin="00:48:18.88" data-timestamp="2898.88">It was easier to find Collins. He actually has a publicist from when he and Jameel wrote a book together. It came out last year. It's described as "an unlikely journey of forgiveness and friendship." Collins is big-- 6'1", blue eyes, dresses like a surfer who's also on the football team, who's also in a Christian punk band-- flip-flops, shorts, a few tattoos, some with scripture.</p><p begin="00:48:42.74" data-timestamp="2922.74">These days, he freely admits that he'd pull people over without probable cause, write phony police reports, falsify warrants, plant drugs in people's cars. I think one of the ways he's able to sleep at night is that he believes nearly all the people he wrongly arrested were drug dealers. He thought they should be in jail. And about those TV stories, I was surprised, but Collins actually agrees with me. He thinks it's messed up how they all focus on him and Jameel and forgiveness and ignore the harm he did to so many people in the community.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Collins</h4><p begin="00:49:12.13" data-timestamp="2952.13"> It's not a story about a community, though. It should be, but it hasn't been. It's been told as a story about Jameel and I, just this fun-loving story, this fun, cute story we can pet. But I don't-- I've never met a reporter that's like, I would like to meet somebody who still hates you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:49:29.54" data-timestamp="2969.54"> I'm happy to be that reporter. And he said he was game to meet with Quacy. He sees as his responsibility to apologize as much as he can. It's his restitution, he says. And he has a whole way he deals with conversations like this. He's worked out all the words, the best way to do it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Collins</h4><p begin="00:49:48.07" data-timestamp="2988.07"> It's all about owning what you did and giving people a chance to lament the wrong things you did. And then I'll say, you're exactly-- you're absolutely right. I'm so sorry for those things I did.</p><p begin="00:50:01.34" data-timestamp="3001.34">And it-- it kind of sucks the anger out of somebody when the offender is standing right in front of you saying, you're right. No, no justification, no minimizing, no-- no reason. I can't give you any reason why I did it. There's no good reason why I did that to you, and I owe you an apology.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:50:28.11" data-timestamp="3028.11"> Collins suggested that he and Quacy meet at the office of this Christian organization where he volunteers.

There you go.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:51:02.71" data-timestamp="3062.71"> You guys remember each other now?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Collins</h4><p begin="00:51:04.54" data-timestamp="3064.54"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Quacy Roberts</h4><p begin="00:51:05.31" data-timestamp="3065.31"> I remember like it was yesterday.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:51:06.71" data-timestamp="3066.71"> They sit down. Collins says, I'm trying to remember exactly how I know you. I know we've had plenty of run-ins.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Collins</h4><p begin="00:51:13.44" data-timestamp="3073.44"> I don't want to say that, like, from the beginning. Like, so it's been 10 years since I've even been there. So if I don't remember specifics, like, that's not to disrespect you or anything like that, because I know this was very personal to you. It's just that I don't remember. There was so many people and I did so many bad things, so.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Quacy Roberts</h4><p begin="00:51:33.83" data-timestamp="3093.83"> I'll start to make it specific, because I still have the police report.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:51:37.46" data-timestamp="3097.46"> They talk about the day that Collins and his partner arrested Quacy. Collins' partner was dirty, too. He went to prison after Collins did. And he's actually the one who said he saw Quacy throw the baggie of drugs, which Quacy says he didn't do. Collins says he remembers going back to the spot later to take photos for the trial and realizing his partner was probably lying. He couldn't have seen what he said he saw. There were trees in the way.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Collins</h4><p begin="00:52:00.77" data-timestamp="3120.77"> So I remember thinking then, like, OK, my partner might have stretched the truth a little bit. But I still was convinced you were guilty because he said you were guilty, right? So--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Quacy Roberts</h4><p begin="00:52:08.06" data-timestamp="3128.06"> It's what the police say.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Collins</h4><p begin="00:52:09.20" data-timestamp="3129.2"> I know I wanted you, though. I know I wanted you to be guilty.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:52:13.10" data-timestamp="3133.1"> Why?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Collins</h4><p begin="00:52:14.46" data-timestamp="3134.46"> Quacy bothered me when I was a police officer, because he didn't-- he didn't just shut up. Like, he'd tell me my breath stunk, and--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Quacy Roberts</h4><p begin="00:52:20.59" data-timestamp="3140.59"> I'd never--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:52:22.28" data-timestamp="3142.28"> Quacy thought Collins had gotten off way too easy for what he did. He only spent a year and a half in jail. Colin says he hears that a lot.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Collins</h4><p begin="00:52:30.14" data-timestamp="3150.14"> I think there are some people that would say, day for day, whatever those other people did in jail, he should have to do that now-- day for day.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Quacy Roberts</h4><p begin="00:52:38.01" data-timestamp="3158.01"> Right. That would have sounded good. That would have been fair. Like whatever, you can set it by saying, one person got two to five. Another person got 40-something months to something months. Take all them, add all of them together, and see can you face up to them? Bad mofo, ooh. Yeah, yeah, that'd be appropriate. Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Collins</h4><p begin="00:52:58.79" data-timestamp="3178.79"> I'm glad it didn't happen. But I could see that argument.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Quacy Roberts</h4><p begin="00:53:01.46" data-timestamp="3181.46"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:53:02.96" data-timestamp="3182.96"> A lot of the conversation was awkward. Collins took a long time to get to his apology, and when he did, it was kind of indirect. It seems like Quacy barely even noticed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Collins</h4><p begin="00:53:12.89" data-timestamp="3192.89"> Even though I wasn't the one that said I saw you throw it, it was my influence in that situation that brought my partner to a place where he felt comfortable saying those lies, if they were lies, right? So therefore, I do owe you an- I believe, man to man, I owe you an apology because I operated in the system that's broken. And I helped make it--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Quacy Roberts</h4><p begin="00:53:37.95" data-timestamp="3217.95"> So what you--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Collins</h4><p begin="00:53:38.41" data-timestamp="3218.41"> --even more broken.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Quacy Roberts</h4><p begin="00:53:39.31" data-timestamp="3219.31"> So what you saying is, you could have just been more blunt like that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:53:42.46" data-timestamp="3222.46"> What got to Quacy more than the apology was something that they saw eye to eye on, and kind of bonded over. For most of the hour, they talked about how bad the policing is in Benton Harbor. Benton Harbor is 85% black with a police department that's mostly white that has a history of misconduct. There have been decades of protests against the police and a few riots.</p><p begin="00:54:01.70" data-timestamp="3241.7">Collins has named names in court depositions, talked about how many officers were complicit in bad policing. He spends a lot of his book detailing illegal behavior by cops that he says he witnessed and participated in. He talks to police trainees about corruption and racism and how easy it is to slip into those things.</p><p begin="00:54:20.25" data-timestamp="3260.25">So he and Quacy got into all of that. They know the same stories, same cops and judges and prosecutors, people they both believe to be crooked who never got caught. There's lots of insider talk.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Collins</h4><p begin="00:54:30.95" data-timestamp="3270.95"> Right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Quacy Roberts</h4><p begin="00:54:31.37" data-timestamp="3271.37"> You see Officer [BLEEP] on film. I'm telling them, I want to subpoena Officer [BLEEP]. Oh, we can't find him. We don't know where he at.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Collins</h4><p begin="00:54:38.52" data-timestamp="3278.52"> Yeah. He still works there, don't he?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Quacy Roberts</h4><p begin="00:54:40.82" data-timestamp="3280.82"> Right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Collins</h4><p begin="00:54:41.34" data-timestamp="3281.34"> That's crazy, man. Different officer, same candy wrapper. But the system itself is-- man, it's just full of corruption. You know, you see corruption day in and day out. You stop viewing people as human. You start to see them as, you know, the next prize, the next notch in my belt, in my career, right?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:55:03.47" data-timestamp="3303.47"> Collins really was trying to connect and win Quacy over. He even offered to help Quacy with a case he has pending.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Collins</h4><p begin="00:55:08.69" data-timestamp="3308.69"> You want me to take a copy of the report? Well, I mean, if you want to, give me the report. Let me look through it. Trust. I'm not a lawyer, but I've seen crooked police work before. Let me look through it and just show you like, hey, fight this, fight this, fight this.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:55:22.01" data-timestamp="3322.01"> They seem to get along fine. They were polite enough. Quacy seemed like, whatever. An ex-cop who says he's on your side? It can't hurt.</p><p begin="00:55:30.95" data-timestamp="3330.95">After it was over, I walked with Quacy to his car.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:55:35.71" data-timestamp="3335.71"> So how are you feeling?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Quacy Roberts</h4><p begin="00:55:38.48" data-timestamp="3338.48"> I'm feeling all right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:55:41.05" data-timestamp="3341.05"> You're not mad at him?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Quacy Roberts</h4><p begin="00:55:44.05" data-timestamp="3344.05"> How can you get mad to a person that we ain't even at the bottom of the situation yet?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:55:49.04" data-timestamp="3349.04"> Meaning, Collins didn't invent dirty policing, but he admitted to it. Collins confirmed everything Quacy already believed about the courts and prosecutors and judges, and about the Benton Harbor police who usually deny everything.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Quacy Roberts</h4><p begin="00:56:02.70" data-timestamp="3362.7"> But by us talking, we find out, 10 years later, that he on the same page that I'm on, fighting against the same people that I'm fighting against. He looking at the police point of view in the system. I'm looking at the street point of view of the system. So both of us looking at it both ways, his way and my way. And I'm looking at it my way and his way.</p><p begin="00:56:24.95" data-timestamp="3384.95"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:56:30.05" data-timestamp="3390.05"> Rob Walker, who used to be known as White Boy Rob, he sees things differently.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Walker</h4><p begin="00:56:34.58" data-timestamp="3394.58"> At this point in my life, if he did apologize, it don't mean shit. Honestly? I just want one chance to whoop his ass.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:56:44.12" data-timestamp="3404.12"> As I said, he didn't want to talk with Collins. But he told me they did bump into each other accidentally. It's a small town. It happened at that cafe from the news story.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Walker</h4><p begin="00:56:53.85" data-timestamp="3413.85"> So when I see him, I said-- I said, Collins. And he looked. And when he looked at me, I said, man, you've been on some bullshit. He want to talk about how that ain't him no more. Well, I told him, I don't want any of that shit.</p><p begin="00:57:08.47" data-timestamp="3428.47">That don't help me. It don't help me that you want to-- all of the sudden you want to change. Oh, let me ask you-- I'm going to be totally honest with you. Did he understand that I changed?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:57:21.84" data-timestamp="3441.84"> He'd changed a lot. Back when Collins arrested him, he'd been away from drugs for years. Everyone knew that, he says. He even put on his license plate, game over. And it was on his car that day that Collins pulled him over.</p><p begin="00:57:36.60" data-timestamp="3456.6">Rob's gotten plaques from the city for his community work. He started an annual picnic with free rides and food, paid for it all out of pocket. But he still has a felony on his record from that run-in with Collins.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Walker</h4><p begin="00:57:47.67" data-timestamp="3467.67"> So why should I understand he changed? I shouldn't. I should get to treat you the same way you treat me. You never understood that I changed, that that wasn't my life no more. Now that you claiming that you changed, I feel the same way.</p><p begin="00:57:59.09" data-timestamp="3479.09">You still a dirty motherfucker to me. I don't care what did you say. If Collins had a chance to do it all over again, he'd do it all over again. Dirty cop-- he was a dirty cop, he is. And to me, that forgiveness shit is overrated.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:58:12.78" data-timestamp="3492.78"> A takeaway which, of course, is the opposite of all of those news stories.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:58:17.01" data-timestamp="3497.01"> Is there a lesson for America from this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Walker</h4><p begin="00:58:19.85" data-timestamp="3499.85"> No.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:58:23.27" data-timestamp="3503.27"> The story of someone who doesn't forgive, who thinks being angry is a totally reasonable way to feel. Yeah, maybe it's not heartwarming. But what's wrong with bearing a grudge forever? It could be something to hold onto that keeps you sane.</p><p begin="00:58:38.03" data-timestamp="3518.03"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:58:44.91" data-timestamp="3524.91"> Lilly Sullivan is one of the producers of our show.</p><p begin="00:58:48.08" data-timestamp="3528.08">[MUSIC - "MAKE A CHANGE" BY DURAND JONES &amp; THE INDICATIONS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:58:48.35" data-timestamp="3528.35"> (SINGING) To make you want me I can fabricate the truth.
