  <h3>Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.62" data-timestamp="0.62">OK. Take a second right now and just think about this. When it comes to the big hot button issues-- I mean climate change, and gun control, and abortion rights, and school vouchers, and affirmative action, and Obamacare-- OK. Do you know anybody who has changed their minds? Who firmly was on one side of the issue, and then they read a story in <i>The New</i> <i>York</i> <i>Times</i> or they heard something on <i>Rush</i> <i>Limbaugh,</i> and now they are firmly on the other side? I'm just going to guess. Probably not, right?</p><p begin="00:00:30.14" data-timestamp="30.14">In fact, the opposite happens. There's this thing called the backfire effect. It's been documented in all kinds of studies. It shows that when we're confronted with evidence disapproving what we believe, generally we just dig in and we believe it more. And the rare times that people do change, it's slow. You don't just have an argument with your uncle over the invasion of Iraq over dinner, and then at the end of dinner, one of you goes, OK, I no longer believe what I did, you're right. People just don't flip like that, which is why this video is so incredible.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Voter</h4><p begin="00:01:01.53" data-timestamp="61.53">Hello.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Joludow</h4><p begin="00:01:02.00" data-timestamp="62">Hello, sir.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:03.19" data-timestamp="63.19">OK. So there are two men standing in a driveway. There's a canvasser with a clipboard. And he's talking to a California voter about gay marriage and it's 2013. And the voter leans against his truck for a lot of the conversation. He tells the canvasser that on a scale of zero to 10, where 10 is definitely vote for gay marriage and zero is definitely vote against, he's a five.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Voter</h4><p begin="00:01:24.01" data-timestamp="84.01">You know-- you know what bothers me is gays that are flaming. Flaming are the ones that are just so damn goofy and all that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:33.48" data-timestamp="93.48">He sort of flips his wrist as he says this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Voter</h4><p begin="00:01:35.27" data-timestamp="95.27">I worked with one for probably like five or 10 years. He was my father's wife's brother. And I didn't even know he was gay. But he was just really-- he had five sisters. And I just thought he was feminine. And finally he came out and he said he was gay. When they act like that-- to me, I don't care if they do it to other people-- but don't do it to me. Because I don't-- you know.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:59.35" data-timestamp="119.35">At the same time, this guy says, he thinks it's only fair that gay people get the benefits of marriage, and they can get on their partner's insurance. And he knows other people who are gay that are perfectly nice, even that flaming guy. Perfectly nice. They're just regular people, he says. They talk for 18 minutes.</p><p begin="00:02:13.84" data-timestamp="133.84">And the guy with the clipboard-- he's not a pollster. He's been sent out specifically to change people's minds on this issue. To try to flip them into voting for gay marriage. And so part of the conversation is just about the issue itself, like the pros and cons of gay marriage. Does the voter think it'll have a bad effect on children? What are his concerns about it? The voter explains.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Voter</h4><p begin="00:02:32.88" data-timestamp="152.88">The religious thing would hold me back a little bit. Just because.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Joludow</h4><p begin="00:02:36.22" data-timestamp="156.22">OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Voter</h4><p begin="00:02:36.91" data-timestamp="156.91">I believe in God strongly. And I believe in his ways.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:39.65" data-timestamp="159.65">But a lot of the conversation is just them talking in this totally honest way about themselves, and their attitudes about homosexuality, and the voter's experiences with homosexuals. The canvasser-- his name is Richard Joludow-- is gay himself. Not flamboyant gay, by the way. Silver hair, goatee, a contractor in the construction business. And here's just how real and free-floating this conversation is. At one point, the voter feels comfortable enough to ask him--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Voter</h4><p begin="00:03:07.59" data-timestamp="187.59">At what point did you realize you were gay? How does a child realize they're gay?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Joludow</h4><p begin="00:03:14.75" data-timestamp="194.75">You know, that's a hard-- I could think back to third grade. And I had a crush on a boy in the class. And it wasn't sexual. I didn't know what that was. But I can still remember kind of what he looks like. I'm pretty sure I remember his name still. And I remember being heartbroken when he left early in the first part of the semester there.</p><p begin="00:03:34.62" data-timestamp="214.62">And some people think that being gay is a choice. I was talking with a voter and was telling me he thought it was a choice. And I said my choice was to accept being gay. And of course, I tried to be straight. And that just wasn't working.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Voter</h4><p begin="00:03:49.08" data-timestamp="229.08">Well, yeah. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:53.42" data-timestamp="233.42">And then at that point, the canvasser, Richard, very skillfully brings them back to the topic at hand.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Joludow</h4><p begin="00:03:58.23" data-timestamp="238.23">So your vote has a lot of influence on how my life goes. I'm with somebody now that I'm hoping to get engaged or go and have a full-out marriage. So your vote would be very important to-- it would affect my life.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Voter</h4><p begin="00:04:13.35" data-timestamp="253.35">Your life and a lot of other people, too.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Joludow</h4><p begin="00:04:14.96" data-timestamp="254.96">That's correct, that's correct.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Voter</h4><p begin="00:04:16.44" data-timestamp="256.44">That's a lot to think about, too. Cause after meeting you, you're a hell of a nice guy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Joludow</h4><p begin="00:04:20.48" data-timestamp="260.48">Thanks.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:21.92" data-timestamp="261.92">Then Richard asked the voter for a second time, OK, on a scale of zero to 10, what's the chance that he would vote for gay marriage? His answer the first time was five. Now it's eight. Barely 14 minutes have passed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Voter</h4><p begin="00:04:33.93" data-timestamp="273.93">You make a really good presentation.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Joludow</h4><p begin="00:04:35.29" data-timestamp="275.29">Thank you, sir.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:38.31" data-timestamp="278.31">And even more amazing than the fact that this actually worked is that it lasted. Richard was part of an army of hundreds of volunteers around Los Angeles who were sent out to change people's minds. And a study by researchers at UCLA and Columbia University found that a year later, not only did these voters stay convinced, they also convinced others in their own households to switch. Apparently neither of those things ever happens.</p><p begin="00:05:03.68" data-timestamp="303.68">From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Today on our radio program, in this world where it is incredibly rare for anyone to change their minds, we have three stories about the very infrequent instances where that does happen, where people change their minds over fundamental things that they believe. Why does it happen in these particular unusual circumstances? We explain. Stay with us.</p><p begin="00:05:30.35" data-timestamp="330.35"></p></div>  </div>
</div>
<div class="act" id="act1">
  <h3>Act One: Do Ask, Do Tell</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:35.68" data-timestamp="335.68">And let's just keep going with this story. This story is Act One, which we're calling Do Ask, Do Tell.</p><p begin="00:05:41.06" data-timestamp="341.06">Where that video you just heard came from was a very unusual campaign to change voters' minds in California. And the campaign came about because of desperation. It was created in the wake of the 2008 election. And you may remember one of things on the ballot in that election was California's Proposition 8, Prop 8. At the time, gay marriage was officially legal in California-- had been legal for half a year. Then opponents of gay marriage gathered signatures, put the issue on the ballot. Not the gay organizers were worried-- in fact, anything but. Polls had them solidly ahead.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Deline</h4><p begin="00:06:13.40" data-timestamp="373.4">Hey, liberal, progressive California. This is a no-brainer. And we lost.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:20.04" data-timestamp="380.04">Steve Deline is a field organizer with the Leadership LAB at the Los Angeles LGBT Center, which is a very large multimillion-dollar nonprofit, the biggest LGBT organization in the world.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Deline</h4><p begin="00:06:30.61" data-timestamp="390.61">We lost by a decent margin. And it was devastating. Because everyone in California and beyond expected us to win that election.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Fleischer</h4><p begin="00:06:39.95" data-timestamp="399.95">People were shocked and angry and despairing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:44.43" data-timestamp="404.43">That's Dave Fleischer. He's a political operative that the Los Angeles LGBT Center flew in to figure out what in the world they were going to do after this defeat. It was his idea to go out and do something that apparently is just never done.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Fleischer</h4><p begin="00:06:57.40" data-timestamp="417.4">Let's go to the neighborhoods where we got crushed and talk to the people who voted against us and ask them why they did that. And when I suggested the idea, Ira, to be totally honest, I didn't know if those voters would talk with us. I'd never done anything like this.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:15.68" data-timestamp="435.68">Not only had he never done anything like this, he'd never heard of anybody else doing it, either. And he'd been in politics for over 40 years-- the campaign manager for candidates in New York City, organizing minority voters in Ohio, organizing for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Fleischer</h4><p begin="00:07:28.59" data-timestamp="448.59">I've been doing political work my whole adult life. I've been doing organizing since I was a boy. And conventional wisdom among political practitioners is you don't talk to the people who are against you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:42.05" data-timestamp="462.05">OK, note what he's saying here. It's not just that you don't try to swing them over to your side. You don't talk to them at all.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Fleischer</h4><p begin="00:07:47.88" data-timestamp="467.88">You spend your time and energy talking first to people who completely agree with you to make sure they vote. And then you go to this tiny, tiny, tiny-- and I mean tiny-- universe of people who you've detected as quote-unquote "undecided," which itself is a very misleading term. And that's it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:08.39" data-timestamp="488.39">Until he said this to me, it had never occurred to me that all the billions of dollars spent on politics in this country is mostly making messages that say, you already love this or you already fear that. So here's how you should vote. There's not much effort to change anybody's underlying political beliefs, to get your opponents to agree with you.</p><p begin="00:08:26.48" data-timestamp="506.48">So now Dave was going to send dozens of volunteers into Los Angeles neighborhoods that had overwhelmingly voted against them to talk. And because nobody ever does this, field organizer Steve Deline says the first question was--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Deline</h4><p begin="00:08:37.20" data-timestamp="517.2">First-- I mean, I'll be honest. At first, it was just seeing if we could even have a conversation with someone who didn't agree with us. If they would even talk to us. That was literally the first part of the experiment.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:49.73" data-timestamp="529.73">The organizers had assumed that these voters were against gay marriage because they didn't know any gay people. And the first surprise was most of them did. But they'd never sat down and had a real conversation about homosexuality in their lives.</p><p begin="00:09:02.48" data-timestamp="542.48">And figuring out what to say to these voters to change their minds about gay marriage? It took them a really long time to figure that out. It was not obvious at all how to do it. And they tried lots of stuff that just fizzled. And the missteps are actually kind of interesting, because they point to what does not work and what does work to get any of us to change our minds.</p><p begin="00:09:21.60" data-timestamp="561.6">Like for instance, the first thing that they tried was an appeal to idealism, to principles. Stuff we all agree with.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Deline</h4><p begin="00:09:27.62" data-timestamp="567.62">Like this is about equality. It's about the golden rule and treating each other the way we want to be treated.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:35.11" data-timestamp="575.11">The problem with that, they found, is that it kept the conversation at this very rational, reasonable, intellectual level.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Deline</h4><p begin="00:09:43.31" data-timestamp="583.31">And that's not where people make their decisions about issues like this. People make their decisions about how they're going to vote on this at a gut level. And at a visceral level. And at an emotional level.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:53.79" data-timestamp="593.79">If anything, talking to people about ideals like equality and what marriage means actually made canvassers miss opportunities to talk about stuff that would be way more effective. Like with this voter, who voted against gay marriage for religious reasons.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Voter</h4><p begin="00:10:07.09" data-timestamp="607.09">I have two very good male friends that want to get married.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:10:11.16" data-timestamp="611.16">What are their names?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Voter</h4><p begin="00:10:12.45" data-timestamp="612.45">[BLEEP] and [BLEEP].</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:13.94" data-timestamp="613.94">We're beeping their names to protect their privacy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:10:15.88" data-timestamp="615.88">And do [BLEEP] and [BLEEP] know how you feel about this issue?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Voter</h4><p begin="00:10:20.57" data-timestamp="620.57">No.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:10:21.35" data-timestamp="621.35">They don't. How do you think they would feel if they were aware of--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Voter</h4><p begin="00:10:24.65" data-timestamp="624.65">[BLEEP] is a very good friend of mine. Extremely good friend of mine. And I think he would be disappointed. But he's never asked me how I felt about it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:10:34.35" data-timestamp="634.35">Sure. And so it sounds like you're very fair. You want people to have the same rights.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:38.69" data-timestamp="638.69">A plane's coming in so it's hard to hear. But the canvasser's saying, "It sounds like you want people to have the same rights as other Americans." And right there, Steve says, by doing that, the canvasser has made a mistake. Because she's moving the conversation away from the personal and the emotional, towards these abstract ideas of equality and equal rights.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Deline</h4><p begin="00:10:57.14" data-timestamp="657.14">It's kind of retreating from the thing that is probably on the canvasser's mind, but she's maybe a little nervous to ask, which is why don't you want [BLEEP] to get married if he means this much to you? Basically, we don't know anything about [BLEEP]. We don't know. When did she find out that he was gay? What did she feel like when she first found out that he was gay? Did it scare her? Was it no big deal? Have they been able to talk about it? Does she know his partner? All these things that would help us understand, OK, you know someone who's gay, but you're still worried what might happen if he got married. So what's that all about, you know?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:41.79" data-timestamp="701.79">This is what they learned-- to stop telling people things. That they should have no road map for the conversation. Instead, the canvassers could talk personally about their own experiences. That seemed to help and connect with voters. But that, by itself, was not enough. The most important thing they could do was, they had to listen. And when the voter gave a clue about something that seemed real and emotional and important to them, find out more. See where it leads.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Deline</h4><p begin="00:12:08.48" data-timestamp="728.48">And I think the big revelation was that our job was actually to go and give them the chance to talk about their own life. And realize that maybe that led them to conclusions that were a little different than they'd thought.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:26.06" data-timestamp="746.06">The very first conversation that captured this new approach on video was this voter that they all came to call Mustang Man, because the interview happened in the guy's driveway with this beautiful vintage Mustang that he was very proud of that had been his wife's.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mustang Man</h4><p begin="00:12:38.41" data-timestamp="758.41">Some people say, "When my wife died, it broke my heart." Well, no. It didn't break my heart. It put a hole in it. And it won't heal. My wife's been gone 11 years now. It feels more like 11 days. I've never gotten over my wife.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:53.45" data-timestamp="773.45">The canvasser here is actually Dave Fleischer, the guy whose idea it was to originally go out and talk to voters. And he does not say anything at all to this guy about ideals. He doesn't pitch him any reasons to vote for gay marriage. Instead, he asks about the gay people in this guy's life. And mostly, he  just stands there as the voter just sort of connect the dots in his own life that he had never bothered to connect before.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Fleischer</h4><p begin="00:13:18.64" data-timestamp="798.64">And then marriage, I can even tell, just the way you talk about her--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mustang Man</h4><p begin="00:13:22.92" data-timestamp="802.92">I would want these gay people to be happy, too. I've got a gay couple across the street there. She's a lesbian. And I get along just great with them. In fact, she parks her car in my yard because we got so many cars here, people have no place to park in the street. So I let her park here. And they're wonderful people. They don't bother anybody. You don't see them trying to hit on other women or whatever. They're happy. Just like I was with my wife.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Fleischer</h4><p begin="00:13:51.58" data-timestamp="831.58">You know this issue is going to come up for a vote again in the future.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mustang Man</h4><p begin="00:13:55.27" data-timestamp="835.27">I would vote for it this time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Fleischer</h4><p begin="00:13:56.96" data-timestamp="836.96">Vote in favor of allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry? Why does that feel right to you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mustang Man</h4><p begin="00:14:03.79" data-timestamp="843.79">Let's see. [SIGHS] How would I say that? I would hope that they would find the happiness that I had with mine. If you could have that kind of relationship with your partner or the other sex, I would say you're a very lucky person. Because I know I had it. But yeah, that's what I would wish on them. That they'd be as happy as I was with mine. Irrelevant by getting with the other sex.</p><p begin="00:14:35.96" data-timestamp="875.96"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:14:39.77" data-timestamp="879.77">It did occur to the organizers that as sincere as these conversations seemed, maybe the voters were just being polite at the end. And when they said they would vote for gay marriage, they were just saying what they thought the canvassers wanted to hear-- hadn't really changed their minds. Which is why they invited in two political scientists-- one from UCLA named Michael LaCour, another from Columbia University named Donald Green-- who designed a case controlled study that was eventually published in the journal <i>Science</i>. Green told me that he expected the results would show--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Donald Green</h4><p begin="00:15:06.45" data-timestamp="906.45">Short-term effects. I thought that those effects would subside in a few days' time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:15:11.89" data-timestamp="911.89">He thought that because pretty much, that's what always happens. It's rare for people to change your opinions. And it's temporary.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Donald Green</h4><p begin="00:15:17.33" data-timestamp="917.33">Because very often in public opinion research, which you tend to see in the wake of political events, is a short-term bump followed by a kind of re-equilibration to a pre-existing baseline.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:15:28.16" data-timestamp="928.16">In other words, people go back to believing what they used to. And the big surprise was six months, nine months, a year after the canvassers visited, the voters stayed changed. The researchers were so skeptical that this could be real that they did the entire study a second time-- a huge cost, by the way. Hundreds of thousands of dollars. And again, the same result. Professor Green says he and his colleagues have read 900 papers. And they haven't seen anything like this result-- anyone who's changed people's views and it lasted like this.</p><p begin="00:15:58.86" data-timestamp="958.86">But there's an important details in their findings. The voters who talked to straight canvassers-- they changed their opinions. But it lasted just for a couple weeks. Then they went back to their original opinions. It was only the voters who talked to gay canvassers whose opinions changed and stayed changed a year later. For those voters, the numbers are impressive. Before talking to the canvassers, 47% of these voters supported gay marriage. Immediately after the canvas, it jumped six points higher. And then a year later, it was even higher than that. It was 62%. A total growth of 15%, which Steve Deline points out is--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Deline</h4><p begin="00:16:37.57" data-timestamp="997.57">More than enough added support to go from losing an election to winning one.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:16:43.98" data-timestamp="1003.98">By the way, the control group-- voters who were not canvassed about gay marriage at all-- they also increased support for gay marriage that year. Because we live in a country where attitudes are changing on this issue everywhere. But the control group only rose by three percentage points, much less than 15%.</p><p begin="00:17:01.72" data-timestamp="1021.72"></p><p begin="00:17:04.17" data-timestamp="1024.17">It seemed like they'd invented something new, a new tool to use to change people's opinions. But they wondered if it only applied to this one issue. And maybe they picked an easy target, after all-- trying to flip people on an issue that the whole country was changing on anyway.</p><p begin="00:17:17.36" data-timestamp="1037.36">So they decided to try the new technique with an issue where public opinion has been deadlocked for years. Abortion. These canvassers, no surprise, were pro-choice. And they teamed up with Planned Parenthood to do the canvassing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:17:28.89" data-timestamp="1048.89">Hi. We're talking to registered voters in your neighborhood today about their views on abortion.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:33.56" data-timestamp="1053.56">A canvasser with a clipboard talks to a California voter through a screen door. The canvasser's young with tattoos and a halter top. The voter's older and heavy-set with wire-rimmed glasses. She's a nurse. And when asked where she is on a scale of zero to 10, where zero means women should have no access to abortion and 10 means they should have full access, she says zero. She's Catholic, from Mexico.</p><p begin="00:17:56.03" data-timestamp="1076.03">And then they start this conversation. And here's how the canvasser tries to kick things off in a way that's going to get the voter talking about her real experiences and her real feelings on this very delicate issue.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:18:09.12" data-timestamp="1089.12">So abortion isn't something that a lot of people talk about, which is why we're out here today talking to people about abortion.

That's why I try to be very open with my daughters.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:18:49.08" data-timestamp="1129.08">My mother's from the Philippines.

And my family is the same.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:19:00.86" data-timestamp="1140.86">My mother never talked to me about abortion.

The voter says that when she was six, her mother miscarried a baby. But nobody explained what was going on to her. When she was 11 and got her period, nobody explained what was happening and how scary that was. And so she tried to be different with her daughters. That's why she became a nurse, to help women. Now and then the canvasser points out things and underlines things in the voter's life story, nudging her to kind of connect the dots. Like when the voter talks about her daughters, the canvasser says--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:19:40.64" data-timestamp="1180.64">It sounds like you are very supportive of their choices, even if you may not agree with them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Voter</h4><p begin="00:19:49.39" data-timestamp="1189.39">I try to do.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:19:51.82" data-timestamp="1191.82">But mostly they just swap stories.

And so does my papa and my sister.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Voter</h4><p begin="00:20:21.57" data-timestamp="1221.57">I know. But it's hard. And you carry it for the rest of your life.

All at once. And it works. After this, the canvasser asked the voter again to rate on a scale of zero to 10 where she stands on access to abortion. Remember, she was a zero before.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:20:58.71" data-timestamp="1258.71">We have that same zero to 10 scale where zero means no access and 10 means full access.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Voter</h4><p begin="00:21:03.99" data-timestamp="1263.99">10.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:21:04.28" data-timestamp="1264.28">A 10?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Voter</h4><p begin="00:21:05.54" data-timestamp="1265.54">Mm-hm.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:21:07.16" data-timestamp="1267.16">Researcher Michael LaCour is running a study about the abortion canvassing. This one hasn't been published yet. He's only been tracking the voters for 200 days so far. But preliminary data indicates that the canvassers did change people's minds. The number of voters who favored abortion to be legal in all cases grows five percentage points after talking to the canvassers. And the 5% stayed that way. They haven't changed back 200 days later. But-- and this is the important but-- that change only happens when the canvassers are women who've had abortions who reveal that fact to voters. Other canvassers don't get the long-term change. So in a sense, it's very similar to what happens with gay canvassers talking about gay marriage. When the people most affected by an issue show up at your door and talk to you, that's the thing that can change your mind.</p><p begin="00:21:57.84" data-timestamp="1317.84">Of course, it was liberals doing this canvassing. So they pushed a liberal agenda. But researcher Donald Green says conservatives could probably use this technique just as productively.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Donald Green</h4><p begin="00:22:06.77" data-timestamp="1326.77">Probably so. I think it's a matter of, again, changing the face that people associate with a given issue. So you can imagine, for example, a conservative group doing this on something like school choice.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:22:20.46" data-timestamp="1340.46">So in other words, parents, or maybe even high school kids who had been in a certain kind of school would go out and go door to door and just talk in a heartfelt way about their experiences in school.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Donald Green</h4><p begin="00:22:31.47" data-timestamp="1351.47">That's right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:22:33.27" data-timestamp="1353.27">Do you think it could work for abortion for the other side? Women who regretted having an abortion would go door to door and just talk about that in a real way.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Donald Green</h4><p begin="00:22:42.14" data-timestamp="1362.14">It could be. I think what's kind of interesting about this is that when I talk to professionals about this technique, this does not inspire a lot of interest on their part. Because of course, it can't be done on a large scale at low cost. And they don't want to invest the kinds of resources and training and supervision necessary to generate an army of canvassers that can actually change minds.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:23:11.13" data-timestamp="1391.13">It is expensive. The Los Angeles LGBT Center spent nearly $2.5 million over four years and reached just 12,000 voters. That is not many voters when you consider they last Prop 8 by 600,000 votes. In a state like California with 17 million voters, they'd have to spend a real fortune to have an impact on any election. Cheaper, by far, to make a scare ad and run it on local TV around the state-- you know, the way politics usually works.</p><p begin="00:23:40.94" data-timestamp="1420.94"></p><p begin="00:23:45.92" data-timestamp="1425.92">Coming up, getting criminals to change by giving them exactly what they want-- or one of the things they want, anyway.

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:23:59.82" data-timestamp="1439.82">It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Today on our program, the incredible rarity of anyone changing their minds. We have stories today about why it happens in the rare instances that it does happen. We've arrived at Act Two of our program. Act Two, Crime Pays.</p><p begin="00:24:14.59" data-timestamp="1454.59">So Richmond, California is right across the bay from San Francisco. And it has been a pretty violent place. Quick illustration of that. The city's police chief, Chris Magnus-- at a press conference, he holds up a cellphone to play a recording made at 11:00 at night there.</p><p begin="00:24:29.62" data-timestamp="1469.62">[GUNSHOTS]</p><p begin="00:24:32.93" data-timestamp="1472.93">He starts to put the cell phone down, then realizes it's not over.</p><p begin="00:24:35.79" data-timestamp="1475.79">[GUNSHOTS]</p><p begin="00:24:39.62" data-timestamp="1479.62">Back in 2006, Richmond was named the ninth most dangerous city in the country, with 42 murders for a population of about 100,000. Then they brought in a new police chief and started doing all kinds of things differently. And it worked. Homicides are now a third of what they were. Crime has dropped in a way that is dramatic and impressive. And police say that one of the things that helped is a program called the Office of Neighborhood Safety, or ONS. Bland name for what is actually a very unusual program with one particular tactic that you do not hear about people trying very often. Joe Richman explains.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joe Richmond</h4><p begin="00:25:13.49" data-timestamp="1513.49">The big aha moment for the head of ONS, DeVone Boggan, came when he was in a meeting with police officers. They told him a number-- that Richmond police believed that 70% of the shootings in the city involved just 17 guys.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Devone Boggan</h4><p begin="00:25:27.26" data-timestamp="1527.26">17 people. And I'll tell you, I almost flipped out of my chair. Cause I was like, 17 people? That's nothing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joe Richmond</h4><p begin="00:25:35.84" data-timestamp="1535.84">Boggan realized that if they could reach just those 17 guys and get them to change, they could really make a dent in the problem. He asked the police for a list of those 17 names. He did his own research and added more names. To get on that list, Boggan said, you basically had to have shot someone.</p><p begin="00:25:56.67" data-timestamp="1556.67">Next, he put together a team of street outreach workers. All of them were from Richmond. Most had served time in prison themselves. And he sent them out to get to know the guys on the list and deliver this message-- come to a meeting and we will provide you with a lifestyle alternative that could change your life for the good. Boggan had no idea if any of them would come.</p><p begin="00:26:16.93" data-timestamp="1576.93">The meeting was scheduled three months later. By that time, a couple of guys on the list were dead. One was in jail. Four others weren't interested. But the rest of the guys agreed. 21 guys.</p><p begin="00:26:28.89" data-timestamp="1588.89">Boggan has a sense of theater. And rather than hold the meeting in one of the neighborhood community centers, he had the men come to City Hall. The meeting took place in a fancy conference room with views of San Francisco across the bay.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Devone Boggan</h4><p begin="00:26:40.85" data-timestamp="1600.85">It's a square table. Great wood. It's a good room. They come in and they have name placards-- their full names, not their street names. Information packets. Things to sign. We wanted them to walk into the room and go, what the heck is this?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joe Richmond</h4><p begin="00:27:00.30" data-timestamp="1620.3">But it was what Boggan did at the end of that meeting that really got everyone's attention, both inside and outside of that room.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Devone Boggan</h4><p begin="00:27:06.79" data-timestamp="1626.79">I go into my pocket. And I pull out envelopes. And I handed each of the young men envelopes. And I told them to open the envelope. And they did. And they each had $1,000 check. And they didn't believe that it was real.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joe Richmond</h4><p begin="00:27:25.54" data-timestamp="1645.54">$21,000 in $1,000 checks were given out that day. The message was that changing their lives should be treated like a job. But the money was also a type of marketing strategy, because Boggan wanted the news to spread through the neighborhoods of Richmond. And it did.</p><p begin="00:27:43.20" data-timestamp="1663.2"></p><p begin="00:27:51.71" data-timestamp="1671.71">That first meeting was five years ago.

Date your paperwork.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joe Richmond</h4><p begin="00:28:04.88" data-timestamp="1684.88">All of the guys in the meeting are African American. They're spread out evenly around the conference table, behind name plates with Mr. in front of their names. But these guys look really young. Some of them are just 15 or 16. They definitely don't look like a city's worst criminals. It's different from the meeting five years ago, because they've had so much success with the older guys. Now, they say, they're fishing upstream. Taking younger guys who have gotten in less trouble. This is the youngest group they've ever had.</p><p begin="00:28:31.76" data-timestamp="1711.76">Today's meeting is led by Sam Vaughn, one of the program's outreach workers. Everyone who shows up knows what's coming, that they're going to get paid. Sam Vaughn tells them straight up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sam Vaughn</h4><p begin="00:28:42.27" data-timestamp="1722.27">The problem is, folk don't believe. They don't feel like you deserve it. Folk don't feel like-- that's a waste of money. Might as well save that money for the jail cell.</p><p begin="00:28:52.84" data-timestamp="1732.84">We don't believe that that's the case. We're doing this because this community and this city cannot be safe without partnering with you. And you deserve it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joe Richmond</h4><p begin="00:29:08.40" data-timestamp="1748.4">So what would these guys actually do to deserve their money? They'll put together a life map with specific benchmarks. And they'll get checks as rewards-- for getting a GED, a driver's license, parenting and finance classes, job training, a job. For now, the first step is to agree, in writing, to an 18-month process of change. And no gunfire.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sam Vaughn</h4><p begin="00:29:29.09" data-timestamp="1769.09">So if y'all  don't got a problem with that, y'all can sign the first sheet.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:29:32.32" data-timestamp="1772.32">[INAUDIBLE] law school.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sam Vaughn</h4><p begin="00:29:34.32" data-timestamp="1774.32">So you can sign this again.

I believe that I can do this. I believe I can be a different man. I believe I can be successful. I believe I can be a good father. I believe I can stop using drugs. I believe I can get a job."

They don't expect the guys to change all at once. They know it's going to take a while before they stop committing crimes. And they don't give up on them when they screw up. I met a graduate of the program named D'vondre Woodard. He's 25 now, has a great paying job. He's a big success in the program. And he told me this story.</p><p begin="00:37:20.37" data-timestamp="2240.37">Four years ago, he was doing well enough in the fellowship that he was given a special reward. ONS has found that even more attractive than the financial stipend is the chance to travel. He'd been to Mexico, South Africa. And in 2011, D'vondre was invited to represent the program in Washington, DC, at President Obama's State of the Union address.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>D'vondre Woodard</h4><p begin="00:37:40.68" data-timestamp="2260.68">I just remember Obama speaking.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>President Obama</h4><p begin="00:37:42.90" data-timestamp="2262.9">You're a part of the American family.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>D'vondre Woodard</h4><p begin="00:37:45.08" data-timestamp="2265.08">And I just remember as he spoke, he always paused. He never "um," you know. Professional with it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joe Richmond</h4><p begin="00:37:54.09" data-timestamp="2274.09">There was D'vondre in the audience, in a suit and tie, on national television, a representative for the ONS program. The thing was, at this point, D'vondre was still selling drugs. He had made changes, for sure. And D'vondre says they were important changes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>D'vondre Woodard</h4><p begin="00:38:10.27" data-timestamp="2290.27">It wasn't the same drugs, like cocaine, riding around with guns, looking for people. No. My life was totally changed. I'm not doing that no more. What I'm doing is marijuana. A bag here. Bag here. Get pulled over with that, they're not going to take you to jail for that. They're looking for guns and cocaine. That's all the police is looking for.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joe Richmond</h4><p begin="00:38:33.43" data-timestamp="2313.43">Before he'd make the jump and stop selling drugs completely, D'vondre first wanted a job, a well-paying one. The guys in the program can make as much as $300 to $1000 a month, depending on how well they're meeting their goals. Real money, but not enough to replace with some of them could make selling drugs.</p><p begin="00:38:50.37" data-timestamp="2330.37">D'vondre figured out a job he wanted, doing maintenance in an oil refinery, like the Chevron plant nearby. He did a six-month training course, only to find out afterwards that he would need a special credential from Homeland Security for this sort of work. And D'vondre didn't qualify because he was a felon.</p><p begin="00:39:08.35" data-timestamp="2348.35">So with help from ONS, he appealed. He got letters of recommendation. He wrote an essay about his past and how he had changed. And he waited for a decision.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>D'vondre Woodard</h4><p begin="00:39:16.86" data-timestamp="2356.86">About two years.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joe Richmond</h4><p begin="00:39:19.30" data-timestamp="2359.3">It took you two years?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>D'vondre Woodard</h4><p begin="00:39:20.84" data-timestamp="2360.84">It took me two years.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joe Richmond</h4><p begin="00:39:22.68" data-timestamp="2362.68">To get those credentials.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>D'vondre Woodard</h4><p begin="00:39:24.66" data-timestamp="2364.66">It was a waiting game. It was about being patient.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joe Richmond</h4><p begin="00:39:28.27" data-timestamp="2368.27">And you liked the idea of that job more than selling drugs?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>D'vondre Woodard</h4><p begin="00:39:31.29" data-timestamp="2371.29">Yeah. Because it's a job. It's a job. A W-2 form. Taxes, W-2's. How the system works, society's system, the United States' system.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joe Richmond</h4><p begin="00:39:44.11" data-timestamp="2384.11">D'vondre got his credentials and learned he would start his new job in a month. And it was at that point-- 30 days away from a brand new job-- that's when D'vondre decided to go cold turkey on illegal activity. No more drug dealing. He said it was like giving himself a test. And he passed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>D'vondre Woodard</h4><p begin="00:40:01.59" data-timestamp="2401.59">I let it go. I stopped doing what I was doing. I didn't have to no more. I just put it down. Got rid of it. I don't need it no more.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joe Richmond</h4><p begin="00:40:12.33" data-timestamp="2412.33">Over the past five years, 68 guys have gone through the ONS fellowship program. How did they do? Four are dead. A few others are in prison. But of the 68, 43 have completed their goals and graduated. But even more important than those numbers, the overwhelming majority of the guys who have gone through the program-- whether they graduated or not-- have had no new arrests or charges for gun-related activities. And by majority, I mean 80%, according to a report that's about to be released by the National Council on Crime and Delinquency that studied the ONS program. Criminologists I talked to said anything over 50% would be considered exceptional. You'd expect most of them to fail.</p><p begin="00:40:52.64" data-timestamp="2452.64">But the numbers that have received the most attention are the ones with dollar signs in front of them. There have been headlines like "paying people not to kill" or just "crime pays." And internet comments like, "So all I have to do is threaten to kill someone and I get free money from the government? How do I sign up for this gravy train?"</p><p begin="00:41:13.11" data-timestamp="2473.11"></p><p begin="00:41:17.54" data-timestamp="2477.54">In Richmond, there are plenty of straight-A students or valedictorians from poor families who aren't selling drugs, aren't committing crimes, aren't picking up guns. And they're not getting a stipend from the city for reaching their goals. And Sam Vaughn, who's been with the program, working with these guys for years, he understands the criticism.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sam Vaughn</h4><p begin="00:41:35.91" data-timestamp="2495.91">I get it. I get it. I understand it 100%. I was in prison. Society didn't think I deserved anything. I got a college education in prison. Folks had an issue with that. "I work my ass off and I can't afford to pay for my kids' college, this dude breaks the law and goes in here and gets a free education." I understand. I understand that balance. But once again-- and if you want to call it pragmatism, yeah, that's what it is-- I'm coming home. Who do you want to live next door to you? The dude who got the college education and who was able to get in those classes and was able to get a domestic violence certificate or substance abuse certificate? Folk who are really in there working on themselves? Or the dude who's sitting out on the yard playing dominoes all day and working out? Who do you want coming next door to you?</p><p begin="00:42:33.05" data-timestamp="2553.05"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joe Richmond</h4><p begin="00:42:35.35" data-timestamp="2555.35">There's no other city in America right now that's doing what Richmond is doing-- giving criminals money to turn their lives around.

It was pretty dreamy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zalena Su'e</h4><p begin="00:43:41.25" data-timestamp="2621.25">It was literally my house, and then the road, and then the ocean.

Just super easy to recognize paradise.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:43:58.50" data-timestamp="2638.5">This was American Samoa, a US territory in Polynesia. Zalena had a tight-knit group of friends who all went to the same big public high school known for its champion football team, the Tafuna Warriors. They went to games and hung out in the bleachers and talked endlessly about their lives. She was also surrounded by tons of family-- aunts, uncles, and cousins. And on top of that was her church. She loved singing with them.</p><p begin="00:44:23.05" data-timestamp="2663.05">But then one day about two years ago, this all changed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zalena Su'e</h4><p begin="00:44:26.48" data-timestamp="2666.48">My dad's just like, "I think God's calling us to go to Alaska."

And he just said, "Whittier, Alaska."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:44:37.45" data-timestamp="2677.45">What had happened was their pastor had sent out an email looking for someone to lead a new branch of their Baptist Church-- in, yes, Alaska.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zalena Su'e</h4><p begin="00:44:45.62" data-timestamp="2685.62">I saw igloos. And I thought penguins were everywhere. I thought polar bears were walking down the street. I just saw frozen wasteland. That's it. No. No, no. We thought it was a joke. But apparently he'd sent in an email, he's like, "Put me on the waitlist." And our senior pastor's like, "There is no waiting list. And I think you're perfect."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:45:09.41" data-timestamp="2709.41">Not that her dad had ever started a church or been a pastor.

To do God's work.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:45:35.91" data-timestamp="2735.91">For her father, this wasn't a decision to make. It was a calling. At church, they often heard the phrase, "walk by faith and not by sight." And that is quite literally what they did. They sold all their belongings and used all of their savings on the move, including what they'd put away for Zalena to go to college. Then they got on a plane with two suitcases each and headed north without knowing a thing about where they were going. No one in the family even Googled the town to take a look at what they were getting into.</p><p begin="00:46:08.18" data-timestamp="2768.18">21 hours later, Zalena and her family landed in Anchorage, where a senior pastor running a Samoan church there picked them up. To get to Whittier from Anchorage, you go south about 60 miles and then you hit a mountain with a 2 and 1/2 mile tunnel. It's dark and narrow and shuts down at night. Zalena felt nervous and claustrophobic. But she also tried to be optimistic.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zalena Su'e</h4><p begin="00:46:29.55" data-timestamp="2789.55">And then we came to the tunnel, and it was like, boom.

There's a school right behind it, which kids get to through an underground tunnel in the winter. There's one bar, an inn, and a convenience store. And there are parking lots filled with old fishing boats. But that's about it. Everything else takes place inside the building, a pink and tan relic of the Cold War.</p><p begin="00:47:33.78" data-timestamp="2853.78">It used to house soldiers. The US Army actually picked Whittier as a port in the 1940s because the weather sucked so badly. There's so much cloud cover there that it was good for hiding ships and ammunition from enemy planes. But when the military pulled out, civilians started moving in. And soon, the building was filled with retirees.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zalena Su'e</h4><p begin="00:47:52.20" data-timestamp="2872.2">That's the post office.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:47:54.18" data-timestamp="2874.18">Zalena gave me tour down a dimly lit hallway with linoleum floors and brick walls painted off-white.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zalena Su'e</h4><p begin="00:47:59.64" data-timestamp="2879.64">This is the Whittier city officia.

But their kids were much younger than Zalena. There was another girl her age, too, but when Zalena tried introducing herself, the girl blew her off. So Zalena did what a lot of teenagers might do. She shut down.</p><p begin="00:50:10.77" data-timestamp="3010.77"></p><p begin="00:50:15.22" data-timestamp="3015.22">Meanwhile, once her family got to Alaska, they found out that they'd moved halfway across the world to start a church for only three Samoan families. Zalena's dad was unfazed. He'd been a high school science teacher. But now he got a job doing manual labor in the harbor and used the money to support his family and the new church.</p><p begin="00:50:35.28" data-timestamp="3035.28"></p><p begin="00:50:39.13" data-timestamp="3039.13">The church is in a windowless room in the basement of the building. On Sundays, Zalena's dad projects a pink and red sunset onto a concrete wall. Everyone in the congregation dresses in bright floral prints, sarongs, and flip flops. The best way I can describe it is that it's kind of like tropical Christian karaoke.</p><p begin="00:50:57.72" data-timestamp="3057.72"></p><p begin="00:51:04.51" data-timestamp="3064.51">Church was the one thing that Zalena actually looked forward to. Other than that, she rarely left the apartment-- much less the building-- for months, despite her parents' attempts to get her out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zalena Su'e</h4><p begin="00:51:14.86" data-timestamp="3074.86">I don't see the draw to leaving my house. The only place that the kids were playing in was the basement. There's no place to go.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:51:23.91" data-timestamp="3083.91">What do you mean, the basement?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zalena Su'e</h4><p begin="00:51:24.59" data-timestamp="3084.59">Cause it rains a lot. So they can't go outside to go play. And so they were playing tag in the basement, which is full of cages, like storage cages. But it looks like a prison down there. And they go play cops and robbers and they think it's fun, and running around. And I'm just like, this is pretty depressing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:51:41.99" data-timestamp="3101.99">For the younger kids, living in the building was like living in one big never ending slumber party. They ran up and down the halls and sang songs in the elevator and took over the lobby after dinner to play games. And because the school's so small, just 35 students, a bunch of them were also in Zalena's classroom.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zalena Su'e</h4><p begin="00:51:58.18" data-timestamp="3118.18">I was really bummed out, because I was like, oh my gosh. I was looking for the whole senior shebang. Everybody talks about prom, homecoming, football teams, and all these things. And I went to schools that had those. And now I'm here, and it's just like-- I am a senior. I'm a senior. And I'm in the same classroom with a seventh grader.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:52:17.55" data-timestamp="3137.55">To make it even worse, one of those seventh graders ended up being Zalena's youngest brother, Philip, who knew exactly how to get on her nerves.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Philip</h4><p begin="00:52:25.03" data-timestamp="3145.03">I would tap on the desk. And she would get mad. I would sing out loud and she would get mad.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zalena Su'e</h4><p begin="00:52:33.09" data-timestamp="3153.09">So what would she say to you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Philip</h4><p begin="00:52:34.68" data-timestamp="3154.68">She(SUBJE said, "Stop it." And I would say, "You're not the boss." And she hates that.</p><p begin="00:52:42.42" data-timestamp="3162.42"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:52:48.22" data-timestamp="3168.22">Until very recently, this was Zalena's life in Whittier. And then she hit a point where she knew that if something was going to change, it wouldn't be Whittier. It had to be her. So she started forcing herself to be more social. When she had to share an elevator with a stranger, she'd smile big and say hello. But what really turned things for her in Whittier all came down to this one day.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zalena Su'e</h4><p begin="00:53:10.01" data-timestamp="3190.01">This is February 24. So that was like our first official "Hey, let's go walk your dog."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:53:16.41" data-timestamp="3196.41">The girl who had blown her off when she first moved in-- her name is Sofia-- actually invited Zalena out. They walked down to the ocean with Sofia's dog. Zalena showed me a picture from that day.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zalena Su'e</h4><p begin="00:53:26.86" data-timestamp="3206.86">So it was funny, cause it was like, "Let's take a silly picture" or something like that. "We need a senior picture." And so she jumped onto the rock next to me and she hooked her left arm over my shoulder. And I was like, "Aw." And in the middle of me exclaiming "aw," somebody took the picture. And so my mouth is open, and we're both smiling.</p><p begin="00:53:47.80" data-timestamp="3227.8"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:53:50.58" data-timestamp="3230.58">This happened three weeks before I met Zalena. Since that day, Zalena's been outside the building more times than she had been in months. One day Sofia showed her a favorite secret spot out in the forest. They walked to where there was an old wooden plank in the ground, covered over with dirt and leaves. Sofia pulled up the plank, revealing an abandoned military tunnel. Zalena says it was awesome.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zalena Su'e</h4><p begin="00:54:11.22" data-timestamp="3251.22">There was like a sisterhood going on right there. Sometimes I feel like a fan girl of hers, cause I'm always just like, "Sofia!" She's my best friend. She hasn't really claimed our best friendship yet, but she knows.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sofia</h4><p begin="00:54:24.39" data-timestamp="3264.39">I was thinking about that, too.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:54:26.26" data-timestamp="3266.26">Here's Sofia. She moved to Whittier from the Philippines about four years ago. Before Zalena moved in, she had been the only kid in her grade.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sofia</h4><p begin="00:54:33.66" data-timestamp="3273.66">Sometimes I feel bad that Zalena always says that I'm her best friend. But then I never actually say that Zalena's my best friend.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:54:42.70" data-timestamp="3282.7">Why not?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sofia</h4><p begin="00:54:44.45" data-timestamp="3284.45">I feel like it's awkward.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:54:46.09" data-timestamp="3286.09">Is she your best friend?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sofia</h4><p begin="00:54:47.45" data-timestamp="3287.45">She is.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:54:48.39" data-timestamp="3288.39">Are you gonna tell her?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sofia</h4><p begin="00:54:50.09" data-timestamp="3290.09">Yeah. Maybe tomorrow at school.</p><p begin="00:54:55.65" data-timestamp="3295.65"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:54:59.07" data-timestamp="3299.07">After finding this one friend, the one great friend, Zalena stopped seeing Whittier as this gloomy place she couldn't escape from and now described it as--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zalena Su'e</h4><p begin="00:55:08.51" data-timestamp="3308.51">Now I would say enclosed serenity.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:55:12.36" data-timestamp="3312.36">Zalena can now list off dozens of things that are great about Whittier. And a lot of them are the exact things she used to hate about the place.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zalena Su'e</h4><p begin="00:55:19.11" data-timestamp="3319.11">Everything's in one building. There's just that kind of intimacy where you can go to someone's house and just start cooking. And the mountains-- they're very flawlessly cut, I'd say. They're like diamonds.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:55:32.99" data-timestamp="3332.99">Before, you would have looked at them as like--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zalena Su'e</h4><p begin="00:55:34.55" data-timestamp="3334.55">Before, I would have looked at them as like, "Ew." Because the mountains back home have trees on everything. It's green. But Alaska's beautiful. It's rugged, raw beauty here.</p><p begin="00:55:49.44" data-timestamp="3349.44"></p><p begin="00:55:52.30" data-timestamp="3352.3">It was kind of like I tripped and then, boom-- fell in love with Whittier. [LAUGHS] And I don't even know how to explain it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:55:59.62" data-timestamp="3359.62">OK, so how would you have rated Whittier when you first got here?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zalena Su'e</h4><p begin="00:56:02.93" data-timestamp="3362.93">Out of niceness, I would have given it a four out of 10.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:56:05.59" data-timestamp="3365.59">And what would you give it now?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zalena Su'e</h4><p begin="00:56:07.18" data-timestamp="3367.18">Probably an 11. Or maybe a 10 on the bad days.</p><p begin="00:56:12.38" data-timestamp="3372.38"></p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:56:13.41" data-timestamp="3373.41">It blows my mind how much you've changed since you first got here. Because I feel like it can take people a long time to get to that spot or they never get to that spot of liking something or deciding to like something.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zalena Su'e</h4><p begin="00:56:26.77" data-timestamp="3386.77">Yeah. I feel like I've changed so much. I'm pretty proud of myself for accepting, for getting over it. For getting over the change. I hope that my college is something like Whittier, because I would get around so well.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:56:45.22" data-timestamp="3405.22">There's a thing adults tell kids all the time, especially teenagers-- you make your own happiness. It's all about your outlook on things. It's such an irritating cliche. But sometimes it's true.</p><p begin="00:56:59.81" data-timestamp="3419.81"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:02.24" data-timestamp="3422.24">Miki Meek is one of the producers of our program.</p><p begin="00:57:06.77" data-timestamp="3426.77"></p></div>  </div>
