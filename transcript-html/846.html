And for some people, that was a really hopeful thing, and others, kind of the opposite. And let's start with the winners. I'm joined in the studio right now by Zoe Chace.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:00:29.97" data-timestamp="29.97"> Hello.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:30.44" data-timestamp="30.44"> Hey there, Zoe.

He runs a PAC called Brighter Michigan. He believes the last election was rife with fraud-- not this one. In fact, there was never a moment, once the count started, where anyone in this room wasn't believing the results.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:50.21" data-timestamp="110.21"> Well, yeah, because it was all breaking their way.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:01:52.59" data-timestamp="112.59"> I know, but also, these are the people on the ground who ran the ground game in Michigan, and they were feeling really good about what they did.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:02:01.17" data-timestamp="121.17"> All right, Eric.

We worked really hard for this. And I'm happy. I'm very happy. We worked really, really hard. We knocked a lot of doors. We went into territories that we never would have, whether it was Detroit-- because we had nothing to lose. As a party, we have nothing to lose besides talking to people. And I think that this is a very-- this is what came when you just talk to people. [LAUGHS] Like--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:02:57.82" data-timestamp="177.82"> She's right that more people came out. The Republican vote in Michigan was unprecedented. Trump got more votes than he did last time he ran in Detroit, in the surrounding suburbs, in almost every county in the state of Michigan.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:10.74" data-timestamp="190.74"> OK. So then, at some point in the night, Trump wins.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:03:14.01" data-timestamp="194.01"> Yes, much earlier than I was expecting.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:16.56" data-timestamp="196.56"> Let's hear some sound of that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:03:17.79" data-timestamp="197.79"> Yes!</p><p begin="00:03:18.23" data-timestamp="198.23">[CROWD CHEERING]</p><p begin="00:03:19.68" data-timestamp="199.68">Trump!

And I think people miss that. I think people truly miss that. I think they just yearn to go back to where we were. And I think people believed in him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:54.54" data-timestamp="234.54"> And that's true-- some people. And some did not.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:03:59.35" data-timestamp="239.35"> Yeah, I believe I've heard that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:04.86" data-timestamp="244.86"> Somebody I had checked with a couple of days after the election was Danny Hodges. He's a Washington, DC, policeman who was one of the officers who defended the Capitol building back on January 6. He was beaten. Somebody tried to gouge out his eye. He was trapped by the crowd at one point, and a man took his nightstick and hit his head. In the wake of that, he's testified in Congress and at the trials of a number of people who attacked the Capitol, including one last week.</p><p begin="00:04:29.60" data-timestamp="269.6">And when I talked to him, he said something that I heard from a bunch of Democrats. It's like, it wasn't just disappointment he was feeling, but a whole feeling that I can only describe as "whoa."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danny Hodges</h4><p begin="00:04:40.74" data-timestamp="280.74"> Like many people, I'm sad and confused. I'm still wrapping my head around how so many people could vote for Trump after everything we know about him, everything he's done. I don't understand it. I don't get it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:56.79" data-timestamp="296.79"> Since January 6, you've spoken so much about what happened to you at the Capitol-- over four years. When you started on that path, what did you hope it would accomplish?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danny Hodges</h4><p begin="00:05:08.89" data-timestamp="308.89"> [LAUGHS] The opposite of this. I hoped that I would communicate to the people that what happened was real, that Trump sent an armed mob to stop the peaceful transfer of power. I wanted people to understand this, and in the hope that they would respect the rule of law and that they would have respect for the Constitution and choose their leaders with that in mind in the future. But I guess that wasn't at the top of everyone's priorities.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:49.59" data-timestamp="349.59"> And what's it like to look at the possibility that President Trump might do what he said he would do and let all these people free from January 6?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danny Hodges</h4><p begin="00:06:00.63" data-timestamp="360.63"> It's hard to process. I don't know. I don't know what to say about that except that I have no influence over that and I've just got to roll with it, however it happens.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:16.29" data-timestamp="376.29"> Today, after the billions of dollars spent and the countless hours of literally hundreds of thousands around the country who knocked themselves out for this election canvassing, donating, poll watching, doing everything they knew how to do, now, here we are, still a divided country, staring at each other across an abyss, but with a clear winner.</p><p begin="00:06:40.29" data-timestamp="400.29">We thought what we could do here on our show is spend some time with a few of the people who felt very strongly about the outcome of this race, who have a special, personal investment in it, looking ahead with them to what's next.

  <h3>Act One: The Largest Deportation Operation in American History</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:11.70" data-timestamp="431.7"> It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life,</i> Act One-- our act names today, by the way, are quotes from the president-elect-- "The Largest Deportation Operation in American History." So mass deportations are coming. Donald Trump promised it. People waved mass deportation signs at his rallies. It was the first item on the Republican Party's platform this year. And at the Republican National Convention, Tom Homan, the guy who ran ICE under Trump, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, had a message for undocumented immigrants-- you'd better start packing now.</p><p begin="00:07:42.93" data-timestamp="462.93">President Trump has claimed he's going to be able to deport between 15 and 20 million people. His Vice President, JD Vance, said the number is lower, that they could do one million people per year. But Donald Trump and his team have never spelled out exactly how they would do this. Our producer, Nadia Reiman, wondered about that, and looked into what mass deportation could actually look like if and when it comes to pass.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:08:06.96" data-timestamp="486.96"> I was kind of unfazed at first when I heard about Trump's mass deportation campaign promise. I've been covering immigration for years. There are so many undocumented people here that we can't even keep count. The closest estimate is 13.3 million. So it's a big job to round up all of these people and to send them back to countries that may not take them. It's expensive. It's time-consuming. It's a crazy task.</p><p begin="00:08:34.62" data-timestamp="514.62">But then I was talking to a source inside the Department of Homeland Security. And I said something like, I mean, I know there's no way Trump can do this mass deportation thing. And they stopped me. They were like, oh, sure, it can happen. They said it so casually, like it was a given. So I wanted to talk to someone who could break down how. Like, exactly how could you do something so massive?</p><p begin="00:09:00.33" data-timestamp="540.33">I tried talking to Tom Homan. He's rumored to be the next ICE director under Trump but has denied there's a written plan for mass deportations. And he ghosted me. Jason Houser, however, was eager to talk. He was the chief of staff for ICE under Biden for a couple years, has been working for DHS on and off since 9/11, mostly in enforcement.</p><p begin="00:09:22.95" data-timestamp="562.95">He's passionate about all of this, in his wonky, government guy way. I talked to him for 3.5 hours, asked him basically to play pretend, game some stuff out with me. What would happen in the first 100 days? If he was in charge of ICE, what could he do to carry out this mass deportation mandate?</p><p begin="00:09:42.60" data-timestamp="582.6">Jason thinks that, first of all, the new Trump administration will immediately start to prep for this-- like, the day after the election, this week. They would start talking to law enforcement in different cities and getting them to agree to cooperate, hit the ground running in January. ICE would talk to home countries to get them to agree to take people back. And after those two things align, Jason says, ICE could decide to deport someone and they'd be out of the country within 24 hours.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Houser</h4><p begin="00:10:11.40" data-timestamp="611.4"> I think the first 90 days is going to be hell. You're going to see the buses. You're going to see the migrants in your home-- not just blue cities, red cities-- Miami, Houston, Charlotte-- like, red states-- Kansas City, St. Louis.</p><p begin="00:10:32.19" data-timestamp="632.19">You're going to see kids not in your schools. You're going to know where they're at because they're waiting in a detention cell and they have cell phones. You're going to see it in social media. You're going to see businesses not be able to open up because their workers didn't show up. You're going to see businesses being raided. And it's going to become more intimate.</p><p begin="00:10:50.63" data-timestamp="650.63">This isn't going to be about separating a family at the border, that somebody doesn't know that family member. You're talking about separations and movements in your communities where you're going to know the guy-- Bill, Juan, Luis. You're going to know the individuals.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:11:06.40" data-timestamp="666.4"> One of the things ICE would have to work around is which nationalities to deport first-- you know, if you wanted to make the most impact. A lot of countries don't take their own people back. Venezuela, for example, hardly accepts any immigrants back. Brazil only accepts two to four flights of immigrants a month.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:11:25.87" data-timestamp="685.87"> So who are the first people who would be deported, like, in the first hundred days?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Houser</h4><p begin="00:11:29.63" data-timestamp="689.63"> Haitians and Guatemalans.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:11:33.25" data-timestamp="693.25"> Haitians and Guatemalans?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Houser</h4><p begin="00:11:35.71" data-timestamp="695.71"> These countries take back the most flights. So I have an ability to remove-- at volume-- individuals. A lot of them have entered through pathways that we've developed, where we've gained biometric, we've gained vetting, and we've--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:11:53.26" data-timestamp="713.26"> Meaning we know where they are.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Houser</h4><p begin="00:11:54.62" data-timestamp="714.62"> Yeah, we know where they are. We know where they are. They're working, non-criminal. We go out, we find them. We're going to find nationalities that are easily removable. And we're probably going to do it at volume with single adults first, because removing families is more complex. You've got to hold them, detain them, put them in hotels. It's very staff-intensive. So I'm going to target down on single adults and nationalities where I know the country will take them back very, very quickly.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:12:20.12" data-timestamp="740.12"> OK. So Haitians and Guatemalans and then--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Houser</h4><p begin="00:12:23.35" data-timestamp="743.35"> There's other populations too, but--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:12:24.86" data-timestamp="744.86"> Who's next after those two?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Houser</h4><p begin="00:12:25.99" data-timestamp="745.99"> Hondurans, right? We talk about Guatemalans, Hondurans, Nicaraguans, the countries where you see daily-- just in the news and the reporting by DHS and Homeland Security-- where are the most removal flights occurring? Those are the countries that accept those flights.</p><p begin="00:12:43.13" data-timestamp="763.13">But if I'm in this scenario where I'm the head of ICE for Trump, all the rules of engagement and policies are out the window. Why not load up a few planeloads of Cuban nationals and send them to the Bahamas and just send them to a third party? Why not just-- I could go find a country that says they'll accept three or four planeloads of Cuban nationals, and I'll send them to a third-party country.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:13:08.71" data-timestamp="788.71"> Jason says ICE can focus on getting people in eight major cities with airport hubs-- Philadelphia, DC, Chicago, Houston, Miami, Denver, New York, and LA. Those have access to quick ICE flights to people's home countries. Jason thinks ICE can get people out before they can get to a judge or a lawyer.</p><p begin="00:13:28.24" data-timestamp="808.24">And one way to catch a lot of people quickly, especially the ones who snuck in and ICE has no info on, is to bring back worksite enforcement, a.k.a., large-scale raids. The Biden administration stopped doing those.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:13:42.49" data-timestamp="822.49"> Do you think there would be raids, then, in the first 100 days?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Houser</h4><p begin="00:13:46.67" data-timestamp="826.67"> I think there would be raids within the first three weeks.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:13:49.21" data-timestamp="829.21"> Really?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Houser</h4><p begin="00:13:50.08" data-timestamp="830.08"> Yeah. Those are not hard to turn on. Like, to operationalize those, those aren't hard.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:13:56.47" data-timestamp="836.47"> Where? Where would they do them?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Houser</h4><p begin="00:14:00.57" data-timestamp="840.57"> You would go back to where there's big ICE and Customs and Border Protection resources to do enforcement. And you would do them in communities that would show the most cruelty. So there's nothing that would stop a Trump administration from going into the workplace, going into our hospitality sector, going into restaurants or businesses, and arresting individuals at scale.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:14:27.26" data-timestamp="867.26"> Can you walk through what that would look like? What do you think that would look like?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Houser</h4><p begin="00:14:30.71" data-timestamp="870.71"> Well, I think it would be very easy to focus on industries that have large numbers and high numbers of migrants working within them. What would stop them from going into a meat processing plant in Virginia? Say there's a couple hundred migrants. There's 80 on shift that day. You go in, you know there's one individual there that has a final order of removal, maybe has a nonviolent criminal background.</p><p begin="00:14:54.71" data-timestamp="894.71">You go in, you do the raid, you line all the workers up, and you start checking status of each and every one of them, right? Or maybe you just arrest them all, bring them into detention, and then do the checks to see who is removable. There's nothing that could stop ICE, at that point, from just bringing people into custody, detaining them, and then figuring out who is removable at that time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:15:17.56" data-timestamp="917.56"> Tom Homan has not denied this, by the way. He's said publicly something like this would be necessary. Homan also said he would do national security threats first-- but then raids, sure. Jason says the raids under a 2.0 Trump administration could be more militarized, with SWAT-style teams. That's not how they've been done in the past. He also told me he thinks nothing would stop ICE from going into hospitals or schools or churches. Normally, ICE doesn't do that. But this is just a policy, not a law.</p><p begin="00:15:51.07" data-timestamp="951.07">So after doing these raids and trying to get people out quickly, ICE would be left with lots of immigrants that they have to hold until they can get them deported. I wanted to know, where would you hold all these people?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:16:03.46" data-timestamp="963.46"> Would you build tent camps to hold people?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Houser</h4><p begin="00:16:07.15" data-timestamp="967.15"> If I'm not looking out for the care of the law enforcement officers that are overseeing it or the migrants, yes, you could.

Let's say all rules are out the-- and I can remove people that aren't removable. Like, I'm going to send them to third-party countries. ICE has 48,000 people in its custody now. ICE has 14 ICE planes that are hardened planes. They hold 135-- 135 souls. I need more of those. But while I'm sending those 48,000, I'm probably going to go out and bring another 50,000 to 100,000 into custody. So if you're talking 30 to 60 days, you could remove 150,000 to 200,000 people.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:19:30.83" data-timestamp="1170.83"> So 200,000 people in the first 60 days?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Houser</h4><p begin="00:19:33.29" data-timestamp="1173.29"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:19:33.68" data-timestamp="1173.68"> So in the first 100, that puts you at what, how many?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Houser</h4><p begin="00:19:40.94" data-timestamp="1180.94"> If all rules are gone and I can remove them anywhere, you could do a million.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:19:47.09" data-timestamp="1187.09"> A million people. Of course, Jason's predicting here, assuming there will be no major roadblocks. But the Brennan Center did this thing where they stress tested with experts and government people whether mass deportations could be done, gamed this all out. In their simulations, funding was a big obstacle right away, so their deportation numbers weren't as large as Jason's.</p><p begin="00:20:10.29" data-timestamp="1210.29">But that was also assuming that the House wouldn't go Republican, which is looking like it will be as I record this. That would make Jason's math of a million people more possible. And when a million people disappear from the country, it's more than just bodies gone. There's ripple effects.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Houser</h4><p begin="00:20:29.03" data-timestamp="1229.03"> One, we'll see massive inflation continue in this country, because we just pulled a million people out of our workforce-- GDP, businesses, small business especially. And then we'll see thousands of people losing their jobs and small businesses closing, et cetera.</p><p begin="00:20:44.13" data-timestamp="1244.13">Two, law enforcement activity-- federal specifically, and in cities and states where state and local law enforcement is supporting this mass deportation program-- will halt. Halt. Going out and arresting the rapist and murderer in your county will stop while your sheriff is over playing grabass with Homan and these individuals and trying to do some big mass deportation scheme and throwing Grandma back to Cuba. So law enforcement will be chilled.</p><p begin="00:21:17.85" data-timestamp="1277.85">Three, migrants will go deeper into the shadows. They will do the steps they need to stay in our country, because it's so much better than going back and risking death in another that they will hide even more into the shadows.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:21:42.95" data-timestamp="1302.95"> And so those that are left behind, it's like they become ghosts. They might stop showing up to work. Maybe they'll move. You'll notice them missing-- at your local grocery store, your bar, your daycare. And at the same time, your screens will be broadcasting the deportations on TV, on social media, shouting the images of a million who are actually gone. Jason thinks this will be strategic.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Houser</h4><p begin="00:22:12.50" data-timestamp="1332.5"> I think there's going to be lined-up planes, engines-running imagery of mass removals. I think they're going to grab people and intentionally break our policy, like, break the law and throw some people back to their home country. And then when the courts push back, they can be like, see, the courts made us stop. Because then they can go, hey, look at these bureaucratic pencil necks getting in our way. This is the deep state. This is the deep state.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:22:41.75" data-timestamp="1361.75"> I guess my thing is, to what end, though?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Houser</h4><p begin="00:22:48.32" data-timestamp="1368.32"> Winning the midterms.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:22:50.36" data-timestamp="1370.36"> You think it's all political? You don't think there's any ideological thing that he wants out of it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Houser</h4><p begin="00:22:55.76" data-timestamp="1375.76"> Sure, I think he's ill-equipped. But there's 8 million just on the immigration docket now. How many people have status here and are first-generation migrants, or from migrant families? I mean, we're talking-- this would affect, like, 50 million to 100 million people, these sort of actions. The idea that there isn't political consequences to that, even for Donald Trump-- I think the pendulum would swing back.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:23:29.06" data-timestamp="1409.06"> I'm not so sure. I think it's way harder for the pendulum to swing back. If you look at the Democrats' immigration platform, what you see is the border bill that Biden tried to pass. That bill is the most restrictive immigration bill we've seen in years. It's a child born out of the Trump administration but also parented by the Democrats, making a harsh agenda seem way more middle of the road.</p><p begin="00:23:54.05" data-timestamp="1434.05">Think piece after think piece uses this failed bill as an example of how far to the right we've moved on immigration, how much enforcement and severity have taken over, how much the idea of a nation of immigrants is dusty and Pollyanna-ish. This fall, a Brookings poll said that about a third of Americans agree with Trump's quote, that undocumented immigrants are poisoning the blood of the country-- "poisoning the blood."</p><p begin="00:24:21.20" data-timestamp="1461.2">This phrase chills me. It's not about legality or order. It's visceral. It's guttural repulsion. It is a violent feeling about a massive group of people. And when the President is the one that leads it, it's not just a feeling anymore. It becomes an action.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:24:47.92" data-timestamp="1487.92"> Nadia Reiman.

  <h3>Act Three: Sometimes Revenge Can Be Justified</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:33.87" data-timestamp="2553.87"> Act Three, "Sometimes Revenge Can Be Justified." So in the final weeks of his campaign, Donald Trump only stepped up his threats of retribution against his political enemies, including saying he'd use the military to go after the enemy within. Two people who've been keeping an eye on these sorts of comments are Alexander and Rachel Vindman. Alex is the army officer who officially reported what seemed like an improper phone call between President Trump and the president of Ukraine, which led to Trump's first impeachment trial. Rachel is his wife.</p><p begin="00:43:04.01" data-timestamp="2584.01">Back in March, I visited them. And they did not agree about what they were going to do if President Trump won another term and started taking revenge. Rachel said they should consider leaving the country if things got bad enough. Alex said he'd never consider that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alexander Vindman</h4><p begin="00:43:17.49" data-timestamp="2597.49"> No, not possible. I think the fact is that I served a full military career to protect this country, and I'm not going to give it up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rachel Vindman</h4><p begin="00:43:26.39" data-timestamp="2606.39"> My argument is, if Donald Trump is reelected, this will no longer be that country. This will be the place where that country was. I want to be able to leave if I feel like that's what I need to, to protect mainly my daughter.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:42.00" data-timestamp="2622"> We were doing this interview in their living room. And we were standing, because they hadn't bought furniture for it yet. They wanted to wait and see what the outcome of the election was going to be first.</p><p begin="00:43:50.75" data-timestamp="2630.75">For Alex, this was just prudence and saving money against an uncertain future. For Rachel, it was, maybe we'll have to leave this house. When I reached out this week after the election, Alex didn't return my text to set up an interview, but Rachel was happy to talk. She told me they did finally bite the bullet and buy furniture in those early days when Kamala Harris took over as the Democratic nominee.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rachel Vindman</h4><p begin="00:44:13.47" data-timestamp="2653.47"> We have two sofas, and we have a coffee table and a side piece thing. I don't know. But that's [INAUDIBLE]. We ordered it after all the buzz about her, and everyone was very excited. And we were just like, we're going to stay here. And I think we were very optimistic. So--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:44:32.19" data-timestamp="2672.19"> In the months leading up to the election, Alex and Rachel have both been campaigning actively for Harris, speaking at fundraisers, that kind of thing. Rachel says she's probably done three events a week for the last six weeks, on video or in person, in all seven swing states.</p><p begin="00:44:45.69" data-timestamp="2685.69">We'd had plans to talk on election night once the winner was clear. But when I texted them, Rachel wrote back she didn't feel up to talking. "I am freaking out," she said. When we got on the phone later in the week, I asked if their views had changed since we talked in March. Was it still that she would consider leaving the country and he wouldn't?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rachel Vindman</h4><p begin="00:45:03.63" data-timestamp="2703.63"> Nothing is off the table, but I want to stay, because this is my country. And I think there's a possibility to continue to be here and to be part of the discussion and make a difference. Alex absolutely wants to stay. It's not even a question. So maybe my decision is just based on his obstinance that it's a non-starter. So I have to bring myself around to that reality.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:45:37.18" data-timestamp="2737.18"> I thought of you guys in the last weeks of the campaign, when it seemed like Donald Trump was increasing his calls for retaliation and talking about going after the enemies within the country. What do the two of you think this is going to mean for you? Do you feel like you're going to be facing some sort of retaliation? Do you feel like it's just a complete open question? Where are you on this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rachel Vindman</h4><p begin="00:45:59.12" data-timestamp="2759.12"> We have no idea. It will depend on signals from their actions. That's the only way we'll know, is to see what they're doing. But there is this guy who has a retaliation list. It's a long list. It's, like, 300, 350 people, something like that. And Alex's name is on it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:46:20.04" data-timestamp="2780.04"> This is a list that was circulating on social media, put together by a Trump supporter, the people that he thinks deserve revenge. He has no affiliation with Trump. There's no sign that anybody in Trump world listens to him. But seeing Alex's name there was alarming, a reminder of how visible Alex is as somebody who stood up to the president and how likely a target he is for the real people in power.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rachel Vindman</h4><p begin="00:46:40.89" data-timestamp="2800.89"> So that's a concern. But are they going to retaliate against all of those people? Will it be all at once, like Kristallnacht, or will it be over time? And do we have time if that's the road they go down? I don't know. Or will they just do it on January 20?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:47:01.35" data-timestamp="2821.35"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rachel Vindman</h4><p begin="00:47:02.31" data-timestamp="2822.31"> But we'll definitely be watching the indicators-- and a list of criteria to say if this, then this.

  <h3>Act Four: I’ve Done an Unbelievable Job on the Abortion Question</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:14.55" data-timestamp="2954.55"> Act Four, "I've Done an Unbelievable Job on the Abortion Question." So I think, as everybody knows at this point, Kamala Harris and the Democrats were betting that abortion rights would help put her over the top. And 10 different states had abortion rights measures on their ballots. Seven of those passed. And there was a very particular kind of TV ad that aired in many of those states, all with a very particular feeling and particular music, very similar language.</p><p begin="00:49:41.19" data-timestamp="2981.19">In these ads, women whose lives have been put at risk from complications with their pregnancies told their stories to explain why abortion bans needed to be lifted. One of our producers, Miki Meek, became interested in these commercials. And this week, she checked in with a few of the people who appeared in them. Here's Miki.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:49:59.31" data-timestamp="2999.31"> Since <i>Roe</i> was struck down two years ago, I've been reporting on pregnant women and doctors in states with abortion bans. And I've noticed that it's almost always the same group of women, about 20 in all, being called on again and again to recount the worst moments of their lives in media interviews, in court cases, at their state legislatures, and in Congress.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kimberly Paseka</h4><p begin="00:50:18.16" data-timestamp="3018.16"> I don't love it, to be perfectly honest. I feel like it's really--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:50:21.18" data-timestamp="3021.18"> That's Kimberly Paseka, who was denied an abortion in Nebraska. She shared her story in one of those ads.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kimberly Paseka</h4><p begin="00:50:27.07" data-timestamp="3027.07"> It's disheartening that we are putting the toughest conversation on the people who are affected the most-- and having to relive that trauma and just relive the worst parts of their life to try and make change. And even today, I'm sitting here, and I'm exhausted. It's like, how am I even standing here still? The last two-plus months has just been exhausting. And you see online and people are like, we have to keep fighting. And I'm like, I have been fighting. Where have you been?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:51:02.88" data-timestamp="3062.88"> Nebraska's abortion rights measure failed this week.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kimberly Paseka</h4><p begin="00:51:05.87" data-timestamp="3065.87"> I actually-- I made the joke to my husband yesterday. I was like, all my new followers on Twitter are going to be so disappointed when I start just posting about basketball and football again.</p><p begin="00:51:14.71" data-timestamp="3074.71">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:51:17.14" data-timestamp="3077.14">Until we resolve the issue, I feel like I'll always say something. But I am going to have to step away from it for a little bit, just for my sanity, I think. I don't think I'll ever stop pushing how important the issue is, though, because until there aren't any bans, some woman's always going to be affected. Some girl's going to be affected. And I hate that for this country.</p><p begin="00:51:45.79" data-timestamp="3105.79">Of all the ads I watched, Deborah Dorbert's really got to me. It was so emotional I almost couldn't finish it. Debra's 34 years old and from Florida. She's got a six-year-old son. Two years ago, she was 23 weeks pregnant with her second child when she went into her doctor's office for a routine scan and learned that her baby had a lethal and rare condition called Potter Syndrome. He had no kidneys. His lungs weren't developing. If he survived birth, he wouldn't live long, maybe just minutes.</p><p begin="00:52:13.51" data-timestamp="3133.51">Her doctor recommended she terminate the pregnancy as soon as possible. She was now at higher risk for preeclampsia, which could kill her. Deborah agreed. She also didn't want her baby to suffer. But Florida had just banned all abortions after 15 weeks, with some rare and vague exceptions. Deborah says the hospital told her that because her baby still had a heartbeat, they couldn't help her.</p><p begin="00:52:36.07" data-timestamp="3156.07">They were actually wrong about this. Florida's law allows for abortions in cases where there's a lethal fetal anomaly up to 28 weeks. But there's a lot of fear and confusion among doctors and hospitals in states with bans. So Deborah had to carry the baby to term, knowing all along he wouldn't survive. She and her husband named him Milo. He lived for 94 minutes.</p><p begin="00:52:59.77" data-timestamp="3179.77">Deborah's husband told me he didn't expect her to speak publicly, seemed out of character. And it felt that way to her too. Deborah describes herself as shy, reserved, conflict-averse. But while she was still pregnant with Milo, she was so angry and depressed that she decided to talk to a reporter from the <i>Washington</i> <i>Post.</i> And after she gave birth, she decided to keep talking.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:53:21.31" data-timestamp="3201.31"> Is there a specific conversation or interaction you had with someone where you realized, I did change their opinion about Florida's abortion law?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Deborah Dorbert</h4><p begin="00:53:29.74" data-timestamp="3209.74"> My parents. My parents, they are very conservative people. And it was my dad, having witnessed what I went through when-- he found out the news, and then he found out that I could not get induced and I was being forced to carry to full term. And he had to watch his daughter suffer for months, and he didn't understand why I could not get the care I needed.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:54:07.15" data-timestamp="3247.15"> Her parents are Catholic, and before this, they were against abortion. But seeing her experience up close changed them. So when the organizers of the ballot measure in Florida approached her to do a TV ad, she said yes. The measure would put abortion rights into the state constitution.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Deborah Dorbert</h4><p begin="00:54:22.57" data-timestamp="3262.57"> I remember the doctor handing me a baby boy that was blue, and I just held him because he was so cold.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:54:36.10" data-timestamp="3276.1"> In the ad, Deborah is sitting on a couch in a green dress. Her husband, Lee, is right next to her, his arm wrapped around her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Deborah Dorbert</h4><p begin="00:54:43.34" data-timestamp="3283.34"> Government had no right to do that to my family. This ban is torture.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:54:55.48" data-timestamp="3295.48"> Governor DeSantis fought the abortion measure hard. He sent plainclothes police to knock on doors looking for fraudulent signatures on the petition for the ballot measure. The Florida Health Department sent cease and desist letters to TV stations, airing a different ad that supported the measure. A judge siding with the TV stations wrote, "To keep it simple for the state of Florida, it's the First Amendment, stupid."</p><p begin="00:55:17.56" data-timestamp="3317.56">On election night. Deborah and her husband headed to a watch party with organizers of the ballot measure, a group called Yes on 4. There were balloons everywhere, a full bar. Deborah felt hopeful and had a speech prepared if the measure got passed. Ever since <i>Roe</i> was overturned, whenever voters got a chance to vote on abortion measures like this one, they passed, even in red states.</p><p begin="00:55:40.60" data-timestamp="3340.6">Around 9:00 PM, the results were in. A clear majority of Floridians voted in favor of the ballot initiative, but it still failed because in Florida, ballot measures need 60% of the vote to pass. It got 57%.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Deborah Dorbert</h4><p begin="00:55:55.78" data-timestamp="3355.78"> We were upstairs in a private little room, just waiting for the results. And once they told me that Yes on 4 failed, it was just-- honestly, it was a shock. It was like a punch in the stomach, and it just brought me back to that day in the doctor's office. And it was just that shock and that numb.</p><p begin="00:56:24.52" data-timestamp="3384.52">We did go downstairs to hear the director speak. And after she spoke and a few other guests spoke, I remember getting up out of the room and going outside. And that is when I just broke down crying. And my husband came and found me. And I was on my knees and crying because it just-- the law took everything from me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:56:58.69" data-timestamp="3418.69"> It's one thing to decide to tell this painful story over and over, but it's another thing to do it and not get the results you wanted.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Deborah Dorbert</h4><p begin="00:57:06.28" data-timestamp="3426.28"> It's hard. You feel like a lot of weight is on your shoulders to try to get the government and legislation to understand, like, look what these laws are doing. I do feel tired. Just sharing my story is a lot of work.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:57:30.05" data-timestamp="3450.05"> Do you ever have the feeling of, when can I be done and stop talking about this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Deborah Dorbert</h4><p begin="00:57:35.23" data-timestamp="3455.23"> So yesterday, we spent a lot of time navigating, do we keep fighting this fight or do we just step away? And for me, I'm up on the fence. I don't want to back down now. I want to see through that the law gets changed.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:58:02.42" data-timestamp="3482.42"> What people don't see when Deborah tells her story in public is how hard she's still trying to get back to real life, just enjoy small moments again-- karate classes on Thursdays, pizza night on Fridays with her husband and her six-year-old son.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:58:25.31" data-timestamp="3505.31"> Miki Meek is a producer on our show.</p><p begin="00:58:27.75" data-timestamp="3507.75">["MORNING IN AMERICA" BY DURAND JONES &amp; THE INDICATIONS]</p></div>  </div>
