    <div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:00:00.91" data-timestamp="0.91"> From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Chana Joffe-Walt, sitting in for Ira Glass. It's the first day of high school, Salt Lake City. A bunch of students are standing around outside in clusters, and the seniors are wearing little kid backpacks-- Ninja Turtles, Hello Kitty, Spider-man. Big 17-, 18-year-old kids in Winnie-the-Pooh backpacks. My colleague Miki Meek talked to seniors Estrella and Angie.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:00:30.98" data-timestamp="30.98"> So, you guys, what is the deal with-- what's up with the backpacks? Why is this a senior thing?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Estrella</h4><p begin="00:00:35.44" data-timestamp="35.44"> 'Cause we enter school, kindergarten, with kids' backpacks, you know? 'Cause we're little kids. And then we're leaving school with these on as well.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:00:44.44" data-timestamp="44.44"> Do you guys have any specific plans you've already made for this year that you want to do together because it is your senior year?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Estrella</h4><p begin="00:00:50.53" data-timestamp="50.53"> Actually, on Thursday or tomorrow, we're going to go change our classes so we can be together more and make sure we have the same lunches and stuff.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Angie</h4><p begin="00:00:57.95" data-timestamp="57.95"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:00:58.21" data-timestamp="58.21"> You guys are in how many classes together?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Estrella</h4><p begin="00:01:00.09" data-timestamp="60.09"> Zero.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Angie</h4><p begin="00:01:00.74" data-timestamp="60.74"> [LAUGHS] Yeah, we have none.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:01:03.03" data-timestamp="63.03"> So what's your plan for trying to get the same classes?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Estrella</h4><p begin="00:01:05.03" data-timestamp="65.03"> We're going to beg our counselor. We're going to be like, we have separation anxiety. We have to be together. I'm going to be like, Mark-- that's his name, Mark. I'll be like, Mark, please let us be together. We want to enjoy our senior year, you know? It's our last year together because we're both going different ways.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:01:18.68" data-timestamp="78.68"> They are really feeling the last timeness of this year ahead of them, the last year in these classes, in these halls, in backpacks, the last year of these friendships in this place, with these people. After this, their lives will be different.</p><p begin="00:01:33.80" data-timestamp="93.8">All the seniors we talked to had a list of things you have to do senior year, stuff they'd seen other kids do before them, and also all the iconic experiences they'd seen in a million movies and TV shows. This school, in fact, is actually the school from <i>High</i> <i>School</i> <i>Musical.</i> It was filmed here.</p><p begin="00:01:50.87" data-timestamp="110.87">Anyway, they all have lists that include the classics-- prom, football games, homecoming, senior sunrise, senior sunset, senior parties, senior memory boxes-- that's a thing that was new to me, along with--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Student</h4><p begin="00:02:04.67" data-timestamp="124.67"> There's this thing called trash bagging.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:02:06.99" data-timestamp="126.99"> What is that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Student</h4><p begin="00:02:07.88" data-timestamp="127.88"> It's like when it's raining, you put on a trash bag and slide down hills.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:02:12.51" data-timestamp="132.51"> So do you step into the trash bag?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Student</h4><p begin="00:02:14.67" data-timestamp="134.67"> Yeah, make holes for your legs and arms probably, like over you on a swimsuit, kind of. I've never done it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:02:23.39" data-timestamp="143.39"> So she has to. Looming over each rite of passage, no matter how stupid, is the fear that if you don't go for it, you could miss something really special, something fleeting. You have one chance at senior year. You have to grab it. You have to go big.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vasey</h4><p begin="00:02:41.78" data-timestamp="161.78"> <i>Ferris</i> <i>Bueller's</i> <i>Day</i> <i>Off</i> is my number one inspiration.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:02:45.45" data-timestamp="165.45"> This is Vasey.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vasey</h4><p begin="00:02:46.71" data-timestamp="166.71"> I want to be him. I don't know if I'm well-known enough to become East High's Ferris Bueller, but that's my goal, is to take an extraordinary crazy day off that will be talked about for generations.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:02:58.91" data-timestamp="178.91"> She's still working on a plan for that. But in the meantime, Vasey's got many other plans. Vasey says she spent most of high school going back home to her hole to study. Not this year. So when she got an invite to a pink party for senior girls, something Vasey never would have gone to before, she went for it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vasey</h4><p begin="00:03:18.26" data-timestamp="198.26"> I wore a pink babydoll dress. I have knee-high go-go boots that I wore. And I stole my mom's pearls to wear because it was kind of a formal event. And it's a tradition that the girls all jump in the pool. So me and my friends jumped in the pool.</p><p begin="00:03:32.90" data-timestamp="212.9">I was talking with my friends the other day, and we said that it's kind of fun to-- we complain about it a lot, but it's kind of fun to just be a girl going to an American public high school because you get that kind of Americana high school thing, you know? Being a senior is this hyped-up event. So it's kind of like I get to do all of the cheesy things that they do in the coming of age movies that make me feel like I really am just an American teenage girl. [LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:03:59.91" data-timestamp="239.91"></p><p begin="00:04:05.70" data-timestamp="245.7">I feel like I've got to be happy with what I've done and feel satisfied with what I've done.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:04:10.18" data-timestamp="250.18"> Like doing everything?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vasey</h4><p begin="00:04:12.01" data-timestamp="252.01"> Doing everything until it's worn out, and so I feel like I have no unfinished business at East High.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:04:17.85" data-timestamp="257.85"> Senior year-- just the idea of it, with all its rituals and big feelings and corsages, it's so powerful, people across the world know about the American high school experience. It's an American export.</p><p begin="00:04:32.19" data-timestamp="272.19">I've been following one kid who came to America as an exchange student and committed herself to the senior year experience in a way I have never seen before. She and a group of kids from all over the world showed up with <i>Ferris</i> <i>Bueller</i> and <i>High</i> <i>School</i> <i>Musical</i> in their heads, with their own ambitions of having the best year ever and going home with great memories, no experience or opportunity missed. Today's show, "It's Senior Year." Stay with us.</p><p begin="00:05:11.88" data-timestamp="311.88"></p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One: Yes 2024  </h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:05:13.36" data-timestamp="313.36"> It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> Act One, "YES 2024." One of the many programs that brings international high school students to the United States is the YES Program-- the Youth Exchange and Study Program. The program is run by the State Department. It was created after 9/11 for students from places with a significant Muslim population. The kids come to the US, spend a year at an American high school, live with an American family, and, quote, "engage in activities to learn about the US society and values."</p><p begin="00:05:47.64" data-timestamp="347.64">YES is a really hard program to get into. Kids spend years preparing to apply. They need excellent grades, excellent English skills, written and verbal. There's an interview, a vetting process. About 30,000 students apply every year, and around 3% get in. In 2023, 500 kids from Gaza applied to the YES program. 13 got in, and one of those was Majd.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:06:15.48" data-timestamp="375.48"> OK, so when I first heard about it, it's like, oh, my god. Like, that seems like the perfect life for me, and I want to go there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:06:22.26" data-timestamp="382.26"> The YES program was Majd's idea, not her parents'. Majd is a kid who has plans for herself. You can feel the propulsion forward when you sit with Majd. It's exhilarating, sometimes terrifying, like riding shotgun with a highly competent, yet speeding, driver.</p><p begin="00:06:40.75" data-timestamp="400.75">Majd heard about YES from kids who had already done it, YES alumni in Gaza, young adults who told Majd about their year going to high school in America.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:06:50.18" data-timestamp="410.18"> And they told me about the application process and everything. So I started preparing really early.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:06:55.31" data-timestamp="415.31"> What did they say about it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:06:57.97" data-timestamp="417.97"> Some of them described it to me as if it was like absolute heaven. You're partying every day. You're getting five Domino pizza boxes every day. [LAUGHS] Yeah, no, for me, honestly, all my life, I haven't been the fun, going out kid. I was really focused on academics. And I like the idea of the 4.0 scale GPA. Like--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:07:25.79" data-timestamp="445.79"> I love that other people were excited about Domino's pizza, and you were excited about the 4.0 grade scale.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:07:31.65" data-timestamp="451.65"> Yes. I mean, yeah. I mean, I kind of have a reasonable explanation for that. But--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:07:39.04" data-timestamp="459.04"> Her explanation goes like this. Majd wanted a perfect transcript. She wants to be eligible for the best scholarships to study astrophysics at the best university, maybe in Gaza or maybe in the US. Princeton looks interesting to her. Majd doesn't want a stray 99% grade to get in the way of where she's going.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:07:58.88" data-timestamp="478.88"> Literally, point to point really makes a difference. Like, if you get 99.6%, you get a scholarship. But if you get 99.5%, which is a 4.0, you don't get the scholarship.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:08:12.64" data-timestamp="492.64"> How old were you when you figured all of this out?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:08:16.84" data-timestamp="496.84"> Pretty young, I'd say, sixth grade?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:08:19.93" data-timestamp="499.93"> She applied along with her friend, Abdulrahman. He goes by Aboud. And on February 16, 2023, they both got in. Majd was 15 years old.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:08:30.67" data-timestamp="510.67"> And we both started screaming on the phone. And all the neighbors heard me. And, oh, my god, it was truly sensational.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:08:41.13" data-timestamp="521.13"> In Gaza, YES alumni are sort of like influencers. They're a little famous, at least to the kids trying to get into the program. They post on Instagram from their year in America. And when they get back, they'd hold assemblies and run programs and seemed like the best of friends. The YES groups had a real bond.</p><p begin="00:09:00.24" data-timestamp="540.24">Majd and her group of 13 would be their own crew. They'd be YES '24 for 2024. Some of them knew each other, and some met for the first time on a bus trip to Jerusalem to get their visas, a day they all talk about as incredible. One of them told me best day of his life, a day they really got close as a group.</p><p begin="00:09:19.92" data-timestamp="559.92">There was Majd and Aboud. There was Fatima, an exuberant 15-year-old, an extrovert from a family of introverts who could picture the whole year ahead of her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fatima</h4><p begin="00:09:30.70" data-timestamp="570.7"> You know like in the movies, like locker room. You go on a school bus. You have a lot of friends that play sports. You play sports by yourself. And then they would always mention, in every single American high school movie, basketball or football.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:09:48.52" data-timestamp="588.52"> What movies are you thinking of?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fatima</h4><p begin="00:09:51.03" data-timestamp="591.03"> Like, oh, I remember "Mean Girls."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:09:55.66" data-timestamp="595.66"> Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm. And that made you want to go to an American high school?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fatima</h4><p begin="00:09:59.42" data-timestamp="599.42"> Yeah, actually. Yeah. [LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:10:02.05" data-timestamp="602.05"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Farah</h4><p begin="00:10:08.89" data-timestamp="608.89"> I got placed in Oklahoma, in a small town.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aboud</h4><p begin="00:10:13.00" data-timestamp="613"> I barely ever heard of Minnesota before. Of course I know of Prince. I knew Bob Dylan.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fatima</h4><p begin="00:10:18.26" data-timestamp="618.26"> I was like, oh, I love Maine. But I was scared because nobody's there. I don't know anybody there. And it's in the end of the map.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ali</h4><p begin="00:10:26.58" data-timestamp="626.58"> Oh, my gosh. I waited for so long, and I got somewhere that's worth it. California is probably like a cool place, you know? I pictured Los Angeles, but then, ooh, Northern California, Redding. I mean, so country.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Shahd</h4><p begin="00:10:44.03" data-timestamp="644.03"> I mean, yes, I wanted New York City or California, but I mean, I was like, oh, OK, Ohio. Well, let's discover Ohio.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:10:52.24" data-timestamp="652.24"> In August 2023, Majd leaves Gaza. She says goodbye to her mom, dad, and younger sister. The YES '24 kids arrive in Washington, DC and take a group photo.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Student</h4><p begin="00:11:03.97" data-timestamp="663.97"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>All</h4><p begin="00:11:06.14" data-timestamp="666.14"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:11:08.65" data-timestamp="668.65"> And then they all scatter. It's the last time they'll be together before the end of the program. September 2023, Majd heads to Washington State, a city called Bremerton, a Navy town about an hour and a half drive from Seattle.</p><p begin="00:11:24.46" data-timestamp="684.46">In her first few weeks in Bremerton, Majd studied her new school like she studied for exams. She took mental notes. The ROTC kids are higher status. Being in a relationship-- highly valued. Academics-- less so. The thing Majd noticed American teenagers seemed to value above all else, though, was fun. Majd did not think of herself as fun.</p><p begin="00:11:48.36" data-timestamp="708.36">She didn't exactly think of herself as a teenager either. Majd is always more comfortable talking with adults. But no matter. She was here to succeed as an American high schooler. So she became a student of fun. She told me incredulously, when they finished a unit in class, the teacher had a raffle with prizes. She took a video and showed it to me. Just look, she said, pointing at all the kids cheering.</p><p begin="00:12:13.08" data-timestamp="733.08">[CHEERING, LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:12:15.77" data-timestamp="735.77"> Typical American high school.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:12:17.59" data-timestamp="737.59"> What makes that typical American high school?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:12:19.75" data-timestamp="739.75"> I don't know. I've noticed that they're very loud. I'm just not-- one time, I remember I tried to cheer like they do. It didn't work out. It just-- yeah, I can't scream.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:12:34.60" data-timestamp="754.6"> When did you try it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:12:36.16" data-timestamp="756.16"> Like for a basketball game. And all the vibes were great, and we were having fun. But I said, OK, let me try. But then, yeah, I just felt so kind of out of place. Like, what am I doing? Why am I screaming? [LAUGHS] So, yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:12:54.43" data-timestamp="774.43"> What does it sound like when you try to cheer like an American?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:12:57.78" data-timestamp="777.78"> For me, it sounds like a rat trying-- like I mean [LAUGHS] a rat dying.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:13:04.38" data-timestamp="784.38"> Majd was aware of all the ways she didn't fit in. Still, she wasn't miserable. She says she was the only Muslim in school, but she was kind of expecting that. Her host family, an older couple, was not a great match, but she moved in with a new host family-- better fit. She ate lunch in the nurse's office every day, but she liked the nurse. They talked.</p><p begin="00:13:26.25" data-timestamp="806.25">And nothing deterred her. Her goal was being the very best YES student. YES kids are all encouraged to post on social media. Majd was excited by the possibility of her posts being reposted by the official YES account. So Majd went to everything-- football games--</p><p begin="00:13:45.68" data-timestamp="825.68">[BAND PLAYING]</p><p begin="00:13:48.57" data-timestamp="828.57"></p><p begin="00:13:49.54" data-timestamp="829.54">--pep rallies--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:13:50.20" data-timestamp="830.2"> (SINGING) O say does that star spang--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:13:55.81" data-timestamp="835.81"> --Homecoming.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>DJ Casper</h4><p begin="00:13:57.00" data-timestamp="837"> (SINGING) Left foot, let's stomp</p><p begin="00:13:59.38" data-timestamp="839.38">Charlie Brown</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:14:01.51" data-timestamp="841.51"> It all went into her YES '24 highlight on Instagram.

And I was just scrolling on Instagram on my phone. And then I saw some weird news videos. And I'm like, oh, my god, is that really happening?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:14:34.53" data-timestamp="874.53"> The next day, Majd couldn't reach her parents or younger sister. By Monday morning, she got news they were alive and at home, nothing more. By the end of that first week, it sounded dire.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:14:47.46" data-timestamp="887.46"> Hey, things are really bad. We don't have electricity. We don't have anything. And at that time, they were running low on food, too. And they were like-- everything was closed. And, yeah, I was very worried about them. And, yeah, I just started having a lot of nightmares.</p><p begin="00:15:06.81" data-timestamp="906.81">Yeah, and they were trying not to tell me a lot of things for me not to worry here, but I already know a lot of things. They can't just hide it from me. And it was just very sad for me to see that they care about my safety and happiness and not about them. I was like, oh, my god, no.

We're fine."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:15:45.74" data-timestamp="945.74"> In those first few weeks, the 13 students from Gaza were all taking in a constant stream of news. Every day they were seeing explosions and rubble and bodies, one horrifying image after another.</p><p begin="00:15:58.70" data-timestamp="958.7">But when they called their parents, who were in the place where those images were from, they got the same alarming positivity Majd was hearing-- "Hi, honey. How are you? We're fine. How was school? Have a great day."

Because maybe none of them were close to me and none of them were really interested in knowing anything. So I was like, oh, it's fine. I can just go back to class. And that way, I can just forget. And maybe that would help me if I just practice my life normally.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:18:37.53" data-timestamp="1117.53"> This became the new imperative for all of them-- practice life normally. When Ali's friend was killed, he was in the middle of preparing a biology presentation. He went to biology class and did his presentation. It was on elephants.</p><p begin="00:18:54.42" data-timestamp="1134.42">Aboud saw a video of his best friend pulled from a pile of rubble. There was a news clip. He watched his friend on a stretcher. Aboud went to school, learned his friend's whole family had been killed-- dad, mother, grandparents, sisters. His friend and his youngest brother were the sole survivors. After school that day, Aboud went to a birthday party for his host sister. She was eight years old. He ate cake.</p><p begin="00:19:21.71" data-timestamp="1161.71">Practice life normally. Keep going. Present on elephants. Go to class. Ride the bus. Eat cake. Try to reach your parents on the phone. Try again. The cell service in Gaza kept going out. Majd kept trying.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:19:37.25" data-timestamp="1177.25"> I was just very worried about my family, especially, I remember, when Halloween came.

But I still had to kind of put a mask on and be happy in front of people. For me, as an exchange student here, I still have to be participating in American cultural activities and stuff like that. So one of the activities was dressing up for Halloween and going trick or treating. But at the same time, people were dying in Gaza. And I'm like, OK, I want to make this quick, but just to still participate and make the family feel that, hey, I would love to participate in something that you do.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:20:30.67" data-timestamp="1230.67"> What did you wear?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:20:31.87" data-timestamp="1231.87"> Oh, I was Hermione Granger.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:20:36.48" data-timestamp="1236.48"> You were Hermione?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:20:37.81" data-timestamp="1237.81"> [LAUGHS] I'm a huge Harry Potter fan.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:20:41.61" data-timestamp="1241.61"> She was practicing life normally.

Where's your loyalty? You've betrayed us. You don't belong to Gaza. Why aren't you posting more about Palestine? Majd read every single one.</p><p begin="00:21:57.08" data-timestamp="1317.08">Here they were, 13 Palestinian teenagers trying to have their big, exciting year in America in the midst of the most immense tragedy imaginable. What would they do? What should they do? The weight of the war was landing on Majd, a teenager-- the exact moment in time when you were asked to make choices about who you are and who you are not, and when you are the most judged. And the judgment that was hardest for her to take were the comments from people in Gaza.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:22:28.76" data-timestamp="1348.76"> Yeah, they just said that you're not one of us anymore, stuff like that. And I'm like, why are you guys attacking me? I'm doing an exchange here. I'm talking about Gaza every chance I can.</p><p begin="00:22:43.23" data-timestamp="1363.23">And people here, they are living in their own bubble, at least high school teenagers. They don't really look at the news. They don't know a lot about what's going on. So most of their cares would be like, oh, did you watch the newest movie that came out? And I'm like, I can't really engage with you right now. It was very hard. You might notice me smiling a lot, but that's my trauma mechanism working.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:23:15.15" data-timestamp="1395.15"> I had noticed how Majd would smile when talking about her tremendous loss, her fear for her parents and sister, smiling, when she told me her friend was killed, smiling. It was a little eerie how much you could see the effort to be OK on her face. She'd say, everyone hates me-- smile. More than 200 friends blocked me-- smile.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:23:37.86" data-timestamp="1417.86"> I lost a lot of friends. It was crazy. I mean, I lost some friends physically. They're not on Earth anymore. I lost some really close people that, oh, my god, they were a huge part of my life. And it was very hard.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:23:54.84" data-timestamp="1434.84"> I completely understood why people were upset that Majd was posting. And having spent time with Majd, I completely understood why she was posting. Majd came here to achieve something. She saw posting about her experiences as part of that.</p><p begin="00:24:09.88" data-timestamp="1449.88">The program encourages kids to share stuff on social media. She liked sharing things for all the normal reasons. It's fun to show off what you're doing. But also for Majd, she saw it as an expectation that she wanted to meet. So she was especially confused when some of the YES students also seemed upset with her, stopped responding to her messages.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:24:30.87" data-timestamp="1470.87"> It was very hard. I don't have support from Americans. I don't have support from Arabs, too, the students. I'm like, oh, my god, where do I go? What do I do?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:24:50.73" data-timestamp="1490.73"> November 2023. Majd didn't post anything for almost a month, and she focused all her attention on one thing-- her family. She went to school, she did her work, but mostly, she pleaded with her parents, when she could reach them, to please get out of Gaza, try to evacuate. But her dad didn't want to abandon their home, and they didn't have the money.</p><p begin="00:25:13.58" data-timestamp="1513.58">Then she lost touch with them for almost three weeks. She waited to hear from them. And she wondered when she'd hear from the other YES students. She figured this was just a little blip. They'd get back in touch. But mostly, it was silence.</p><p begin="00:25:29.12" data-timestamp="1529.12">She'd see one of them posting something from their daily life on Instagram and think, so they are posting. Did that mean they weren't actually mad at her for posting? But if they weren't mad at her for posting, what happened, then? Why weren't they in touch with her? She never reached out to ask. She just wondered.</p><p begin="00:25:48.67" data-timestamp="1548.67">December 2023. Majd was living with a nurse named Tana Rode. Tana would watch Majd come and go from her room, always clutching her phone, sometimes her eyes puffy and red. Tana tried to keep the fridge stocked with parmesan cheese bagels from Costco. Majd seemed to like them, and it got her out of her room in the morning. Tana has a teenage daughter of her own. She was careful with Majd, stayed close, available, but gave Majd her space.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tana Rode</h4><p begin="00:26:17.46" data-timestamp="1577.46"> She's not one who will come down here and cry. I can just sense this heaviness in her, understandably. 'Cause she's happy. She's chatty. That girl loves to talk. So I can feel it when she's down.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:26:37.18" data-timestamp="1597.18"> Before October 7, Tana Rode knew next to nothing about Israel or Palestine. She told me maybe she'd seen a bumper sticker one time. Now she was responsible for this Palestinian kid. She read everything she could, tracked the news. She followed the numbers. November, more than 10,000 Palestinians dead. By Christmas, 20,000. Tana had a brand new awareness, an alarming awareness, of just how vulnerable Majd's family was. She worried.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tana Rode</h4><p begin="00:27:09.49" data-timestamp="1629.49"> Every single day thinking about, am I going to get the call at work? Is today the day that her family's gone? Like every single day. And, oh, my god, I don't want to have to tell her.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:27:28.29" data-timestamp="1648.29"> Tana, were you imagining this kid is my responsibility if she loses her family?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tana Rode</h4><p begin="00:27:33.12" data-timestamp="1653.12"> Yes. Absolutely.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:27:36.92" data-timestamp="1656.92"> Tana wasn't the only host mom who told me this. Farah's host mom in Oklahoma told me she and her husband sat down together and walked through the different scenarios so they'd know what they were OK offering if they needed to offer. Fatima overheard her host mother call a friend who had hosted a Ukrainian student to ask for advice, just in case.</p><p begin="00:27:59.65" data-timestamp="1679.65">January 2024. Majd told her dad if he wasn't going to leave Gaza for himself, he should at least do it for her younger sister. The argument Majd made, it was very her. Majd told him, she's 12 years old. She needs to be in school. Without an education, what kind of future will she have? Her dad relented.</p><p begin="00:28:22.01" data-timestamp="1702.01">Tana, her host mom, helped Majd to raise money to get her parents out of Gaza. February, her family made it out of Gaza. Majd got a message.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:28:34.21" data-timestamp="1714.21"> I was about to lose hope. But then one day, he just called me and said, oh, hey, we're traveling tomorrow.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:28:41.57" data-timestamp="1721.57"> What did it feel like when you were like, they are there?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:28:47.40" data-timestamp="1727.4"> I literally have no words to describe this. It feels like you were just burning in flames, and then somebody put water all over you. And now, yeah, you're not burning anymore. And I just went to school so happy that week. It was crazy. Everybody was noticing, even the teachers. And they said, oh, somebody's got good news here. What's going on? [LAUGHS] And, yeah, they were all so happy for me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:29:18.50" data-timestamp="1758.5"> The first half of Majd's year had been dominated by terrifying news from home and nightmares about her family and social isolation. She'd been under so much pressure. When this worry for her family lifted, Majd experienced a surge of energy. She was giddy. She wanted to do everything. She wanted to be a kid on the YES program, not just a kid in the midst of a war. She wanted to be like all the other YES students from all the other countries that she was seeing in her Instagram feed having a normal American year.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:29:51.74" data-timestamp="1791.74"> I started to do golf a few days after my parents got out.

Her parents were in an unstable situation. Their future-- and hers-- still very unclear. Was she just putting all that aside for now? Was that going to work? Maybe? At least it seemed like a really nice reprieve.</p><p begin="00:32:23.47" data-timestamp="1943.47">March. Sometimes Majd would open Snapchat, and the app would send her a This Time Last Year with a picture of her and the other YES students in Gaza. Back then, they'd all just gotten accepted and were meeting and texting each other, becoming a group.</p><p begin="00:32:39.16" data-timestamp="1959.16">She'd get a pang of longing and anxiety. She missed them. She'd not heard from them in five months. Were they all still chatting all the time, just without her? Late at night, she'd stare at their profiles in bed, scrolling. And then finally, one night--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:32:57.17" data-timestamp="1977.17"> I reached out to one of the girls in the exchange program.

We're telling the story of a group of 13 students who came to the United States from Gaza last September to do a year of high school in America. They're on a program run by the State Department called YES.</p><p begin="00:34:50.57" data-timestamp="2090.57">We're in April 2024, two months before the end of the YES program. And then what? The YES kids were pinning their hopes on this. The year before, the State Department had extended the program for some Ukrainian YES students, gave them another year in the US. That's what Majd was hoping for.</p><p begin="00:35:11.03" data-timestamp="2111.03">But then the State Department sent letters to the kids saying they would not be extending the program for the 13 students from Gaza. The program would end June 6.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:35:21.30" data-timestamp="2121.3"> You've got to figure everything out by yourself. And I'm like, we're 16-year-olds. We can't just come up with something from thin air. We need some sort of help.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:35:33.11" data-timestamp="2133.11"> The State Department says it did provide support to students, that the health, safety, and security of all students was their top priority. Their goal was to reunite students with their families. And they say they worked closely with them on their post-program plans. They also say they provided an equally rigorous process for exchange students from both Ukraine and Gaza.</p><p begin="00:35:55.26" data-timestamp="2155.26">But what Majd and the other students from Gaza describe is feeling like they were on their own to come up with a plan. Even for Majd, a master planner of her own life, this was a lot. She looked at her options.</p><p begin="00:36:09.53" data-timestamp="2169.53">Her parents didn't think it made sense for her to come to Egypt. Their situation wasn't stable. Like all Palestinians who fled Gaza, they weren't allowed to work in Egypt. Everything was incredibly expensive. As of April, her sister wasn't even able to go to school. If Majd joined them, it wasn't clear how she'd continue her education in Egypt, if the family could even continue staying there.</p><p begin="00:36:32.06" data-timestamp="2192.06">So Majd frantically searched for boarding schools in the US with scholarships that might be able to extend a student visa in America. But the deadlines to apply had passed. She learned everything she could about immigration law. She had relatives in Michigan. She could maybe move in with them. But what were the schools like? And how would she get a lawyer and study and live? She ran it over and over in her head.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:36:56.99" data-timestamp="2216.99"> OK, just say I move in with my relatives in the US and, OK, what next? I don't have the right documents to even get a job. We're not allowed to drive here. And I don't have health insurance. My insurance from the State Department ends soon. And then what am I going to do?</p><p begin="00:37:19.26" data-timestamp="2239.26">I talked to my financial literacy teacher. She teaches us about insurance and stuff. She said, oh, you can buy it from Marketplace or something, but I don't work. I don't have an income to even pay for an insurance. So I don't know.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:37:35.70" data-timestamp="2255.7"> This was all of them. All 13 teenagers were scrambling to figure out what to do and where to go, calling their parents, talking with the State Department, and casting around randomly for advice, like Fatima.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fatima</h4><p begin="00:37:48.99" data-timestamp="2268.99"> My friends were trying to help out. Some of them are like, do you have any people you know in the States?

She says the lawyer told her to apply for asylum, move in with her relatives in Michigan, enroll in public school. There, she could do a senior year again, find scholarships to go to college in the US. Majd told me, I will not be going back to Gaza. She sounded a little stunned.</p><p begin="00:38:33.27" data-timestamp="2313.27">Majd and I talked about a lot of devastating things, but this was really the only time I could tell she was taking in the meaning of what she was saying. It would be nearly impossible for her to leave the US while she waited for asylum. She had a new plan that she laid out for me. And at first, she had that eerie smile. But then it disappeared.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Majd</h4><p begin="00:38:53.70" data-timestamp="2333.7"> It just breaks my heart that a place where I grew up in, I just-- I just can't see that again. And the lawyer said that it's going to take from 7 to 10 years, at least, to get to an asylum interview because of the lack of asylum officers here in Washington.</p><p begin="00:39:14.63" data-timestamp="2354.63">And I'm like, are you telling me I have to wait 7 to 10 years? I'm going to be graduating and having my whole career and life here until I get to an interview? And then I have to wait again to get the result? Yeah.</p><p begin="00:39:31.00" data-timestamp="2371">And imagine not seeing my family all of that time. It's crazy. I'm 16 now. I'm imagining, like, OK, let's calculate just 10 years. I'm going to be at least 26 when I see them again. And, yeah, for me, I'm just telling you this.</p><p begin="00:39:52.46" data-timestamp="2392.46">But, yeah, I still don't process that because both of my parents, they have chronic-- oh, my god.

Tana, Majd's host mom, is driving her to Seattle. Majd is going for an overnight with friends. When she was back home in Gaza, Majd would come home after school and find her mom. She'd sit down wherever her mom was-- in the living room or the kitchen-- and talk. She'd talk about her day, her thoughts, her problems. She could go on and on until her mom usually kicked her out, telling her, OK, that's enough already. I've been listening to you talk for three hours.</p><p begin="00:41:39.59" data-timestamp="2499.59">In Bremerton, when Majd talks like this, it's either to the school nurse, Ms. Caroline, or Tana.

She's talking about what happened last year, in Arabic, talking about her family with people who actually know her family. It's enough like home at her aunt's house that it's not really possible for her to set everything aside. She has to find a place for it.</p><p begin="00:54:55.63" data-timestamp="3295.63">She's noticing when she smiles as she's saying sad things, trying not to do that. She started therapy. And she started school again. She needs more credits to graduate. Majd is doing another senior year, a senior year she never planned on. This time, she's not trying to make it perfect.</p><p begin="00:55:27.32" data-timestamp="3327.32">["THIS MUST BE THE PLACE" BY KISHI BASHI]</p><p begin="00:55:30.77" data-timestamp="3330.77"></p><p begin="00:56:01.95" data-timestamp="3361.95"></p><p begin="00:56:08.03" data-timestamp="3368.03"></p></div>  </div>
