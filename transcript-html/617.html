  <h3>Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.94" data-timestamp="0.94"> So are you thinking about this a lot??</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:00:03.48" data-timestamp="3.48"> I got sad about it on the training again this morning. It comes at totally random moments, you know?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:08.18" data-timestamp="8.18"> That's David Kestenbaum, one of the producers of our program. And to understand what he's been sad about, I think it's not going to make any sense unless you know that he's a physicist. He has a PhD in particle physics.</p><p begin="00:00:20.05" data-timestamp="20.05">He was on one of the teams that discovered the top quark at Fermilab back in the '90s, before he became a journalist. So he thinks like a scientist. And he recently stumbled across a story he'd never heard before about Enrico Fermi, the physicist that Fermilab is actually named for.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:00:35.46" data-timestamp="35.46"> So the story goes that this is 1950. Fermi's visiting Los Alamos.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:41.03" data-timestamp="41.03"> Los Alamos, where they developed the atomic bomb?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:00:44.17" data-timestamp="44.17"> Yeah. And they're sitting around at lunch. It's Fermi and a handful of other physicists and they start talking about extraterrestrials.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:52.49" data-timestamp="52.49"> One of the scientists who was there remembers that they talked about some New Yorker cartoon, which had flying saucers and cheerful aliens stealing our trash cans. They joked about it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:01:01.95" data-timestamp="61.95"> And then out of nowhere, Fermi says something like, so where are they?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:06.59" data-timestamp="66.59"> Meaning?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:01:08.59" data-timestamp="68.59"> The aliens.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:09.72" data-timestamp="69.72"> And did people know what he meant?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:01:11.79" data-timestamp="71.79"> Yeah, somehow everybody knew exactly what he meant. The idea was basically that, like, the galaxy is this huge place, right? Hundreds of billions of stars. It's been around for billions of years. If you believe that intelligent life is something that just arises given enough time, where is everybody?</p><p begin="00:01:32.79" data-timestamp="92.79">Like, there have been billions of years, where civilizations could have developed and become way more advanced than we are and traveled from star to star, sent signals or something. Where are they? If that's right, where are they?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:48.24" data-timestamp="108.24"> This question became known as the Fermi Paradox, which goes like this. If it's so likely that intelligent life exists elsewhere, where is it? Why hasn't anybody shown up? And of course, the simple answer to that would be, well, nobody else exists.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> David  Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:02:03.58" data-timestamp="123.58"> And I had never thought-- it made me think, maybe we're alone. I really thought that for the first time. Yeah, it made me really sad.</p><p begin="00:02:17.95" data-timestamp="137.95">I had never thought about it seriously before. I had always assumed that life was everywhere. But he's making a really serious point here. He's raising a tough question.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:28.52" data-timestamp="148.52"> So for months now, when David's brushing his teeth or doing nothing in particular, it'll hit him again. Maybe we're alone in the universe. Like this morning, on the train.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:02:39.87" data-timestamp="159.87"> The specific thought I was having was that this would mean that there's nobody out there who knows more than we do, like, about science, about-- there are no better songs. There are no better books. This is it, you know?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:57.69" data-timestamp="177.69"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> David  Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:02:58.66" data-timestamp="178.66"> Like, what we know is it. What we are is it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> Ira        Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:04.32" data-timestamp="184.32"> Why is your response to this sadness?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:03:11.17" data-timestamp="191.17"> Why is your response not sadness? Of course that's sad.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> Ira  Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:17.26" data-timestamp="197.26"> This whole thing reminds me of just a really, really old Woody Allen movie-- it might be Annie Hall-- where there's a scene of him as a kid. And he's saying to some adult-- she's saying, why didn't you do your homework or something like that. And he's like, well, because the universe is expanding.</p><p begin="00:03:36.57" data-timestamp="216.57">And then the adult is like, why is that any of your business? And that's my question for you. Why is it any of your business?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:03:44.95" data-timestamp="224.95"> Oh, I totally read that the other way. I was like, he's making a serious point. Why is no one listening to him?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:52.07" data-timestamp="232.07"> Oh.</p><p begin="00:03:52.86" data-timestamp="232.86">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> David  Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:03:53.23" data-timestamp="233.23"> See, that's the problem. I'm in his shoes and I'm not making a joke. I feel like if you were able to really imagine it, it would make you sad.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:11.21" data-timestamp="251.21"> Oh, really?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:04:12.72" data-timestamp="252.72"> Yeah. When you look up at the stars, do you think about what they are, and the distances and stuff, and all that?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:22.68" data-timestamp="262.68"> No, not in a deep way.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:04:24.03" data-timestamp="264.03"> I mean, it's so easy not to feel anything. But it's a crazy thing you're looking at, just how small we are and how big it is.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Ira  Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:33.47" data-timestamp="273.47"> David tried to explain the feeling that he was having to me in a bunch of different ways. And the explanation that made the most sense to me was when he told me that he'd been looking at videos with his five-year-old son, Augie, who's really into space. Videos of the Apollo moon missions, with astronauts happily bouncing around on the lunar surface and driving in that moonbuggy they had. And David found himself just looking at where they were, really looking at the moon.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:05:00.29" data-timestamp="300.29"> Oh, look how dead it is. There is nothing there. The moon is just this dusty, awful rock. And what if it's like that everywhere.</p><p begin="00:05:10.84" data-timestamp="310.84">You know, liquid methane oceans and whatever rocks, but no life at all. What if that's the rest of the galaxy? Space just seemed like some horrible, awful, dangerous place to me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:22.99" data-timestamp="322.99"> I see that. There's no hope. It's just death out there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:05:26.32" data-timestamp="326.32"> It's a lot of pressure if we're the only thing going on. It's a lonely thought.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira  Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:32.48" data-timestamp="332.48"> I first found out that David was thinking about all this at our staff story meeting a couple of weeks ago. And I'll be honest, when he told everybody that he was upset about the Fermi Paradox, we all laughed at him. Like OK, that's what's upsetting you? Which he gets, but it doesn't help him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:05:51.38" data-timestamp="351.38"> I can't find anyone to really talk it through with.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:55.27" data-timestamp="355.27"> Because none of us took it seriously?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:05:57.86" data-timestamp="357.86"> Yeah. I feel like when I say it, people are like, yeah, I don't know, or I always thought that. The thing that bugs me about it is he's making a real scientific argument. I wanted to talk through the science of it with somebody. It's not just a "what do you think? I bet you they're there. I bet you they're not there." He's making up a physics point, you know?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:16.51" data-timestamp="376.51"> Well, today on our radio program, stories from the one civilization we know does exist, stories of people who head out on missions here on our own planet to vanquish their own loneliness. We hear from a 9-year-old girl, a married couple, and of course, David. From WBEZ Chicago, it's This American Life. Stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One: I Think We’re Alone Now</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:42.98" data-timestamp="402.98">Act 1, "I Think We're Alone Now." So none of us would satisfyingly engage our coworker, David Kestenbaum, about Fermi's paradox. He needed a physicist to talk to to help him figure out what to think.</p><p begin="00:06:57.46" data-timestamp="417.46">So he went to talk to one of his old physics professors from when he got his PhD at Harvard. Her name is Melissa Franklin. Her specialty is particle physics. Here's what happened.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:07:05.92" data-timestamp="425.92"> I went to see Melissa because I figured for sure she would understand. When I was a student, I'd go to her with physics problems but also life problems. Arguably, this was both.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> David  Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:07:15.90" data-timestamp="435.9"> So there's this thing that's been bugging me. And every time I tell people about it, they just laugh.</p><p begin="00:07:25.34" data-timestamp="445.34">[LAUGHING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Franklin</h4><p begin="00:07:25.78" data-timestamp="445.78"> OK, I'm laughing first.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:07:29.67" data-timestamp="449.67"> Do you know what the Fermi Paradox is?</p></div><div class="host"><h4> David  Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:07:33.22" data-timestamp="453.22"> I told her the story about Fermi at lunch and his question, where is everybody?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:07:41.07" data-timestamp="461.07"> We talk about these things all the time, you know, casually or just over beers or coffee and it's all a joke. But it felt really serious.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Franklin</h4><p begin="00:07:51.83" data-timestamp="471.83"> I don't think-- honestly, you say that we talk about these things all the time over beer, but I don't think people actually do. They think about extraterrestrials. We think about what messages-- I've thought for hours about what messages they would send, what messages I would send, how to communicate with them. But it actually, until you walked in here today, I'd never thought maybe there weren't any.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:08:14.20" data-timestamp="494.2"> Honestly, I was feeling a little choked up when I got to the part about how I had been thinking we might be alone. I thought she would be sympathetic, but she kind of rolled her eyes, just like everybody else.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Franklin</h4><p begin="00:08:26.16" data-timestamp="506.16"> Look, I mean there's so-- look, compared to seeing all the polar bears die, this is not sad. So here, the point is there were polar bears and now there aren't any. And there, there were never anybody and we're sad. There's still nobody there!</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:08:44.56" data-timestamp="524.56"> I guess, I get that it's a weird kind of sadness, but it's a real thing I feel.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Franklin</h4><p begin="00:08:48.35" data-timestamp="528.35"> I know you feel that. I know. I know. I know you do feel bad, but what do you feel about the polar bears?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> David    Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:08:57.19" data-timestamp="537.19"> This was something I also felt very alone in my worrying about it, you know? Yeah. I would say to my wife, you know, I was thinking again today we might be alone in the universe. And she's like, I know, sweetie.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Melissa  Franklin</h4><p begin="00:09:10.73" data-timestamp="550.73"> I know, sweetie? That's really nice.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:09:13.85" data-timestamp="553.85"> Like, just think about it for real, like, for real. Not just as a "hey, what are the odds we're alone," or this or that. For real, because it might be true.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Franklin</h4><p begin="00:09:23.03" data-timestamp="563.03"> Yeah. Do you think it's really hard? Maybe you're just having college thoughts when you're 45.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>     David       Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:09:30.09" data-timestamp="570.09"> But then we got down to it, the thing that I'd come for. Melissa started doing this thing that I'd forgotten physicists sometimes do when you ask a question. They ask you more questions.</p><p begin="00:09:47.65" data-timestamp="587.65">What exactly do you mean by being alone? Let's properly define the question here. You're talking about no intelligent life or no life at all? What if there's one crappy plant on another planet? How would you feel about that? What if advanced life like us is just a mathematical improbability, a total fluke?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Franklin</h4><p begin="00:10:03.31" data-timestamp="603.31"> And then you would say, OK, if that's the case, I have to believe in God. So that's what you're saying.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:10:07.24" data-timestamp="607.24"> How many physicists do you know who believe in God?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Franklin</h4><p begin="00:10:10.00" data-timestamp="610"> Six.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:10:10.96" data-timestamp="610.96"> I don't think Fermi thought we were alone. And Melissa didn't think we were alone either. Come on, she said. There are lots of possible explanations for why we haven't found intelligent life. It doesn't have to be that we're alone. She ran through some of them with me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Franklin</h4><p begin="00:10:26.00" data-timestamp="626"> OK, here we go.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:10:26.99" data-timestamp="626.99"> There are lists of them online that scientists and other people have come up with. I have to say, they were not encouraging. For example, maybe other life has arisen, but just not intelligent life. In other words, there are microbes but nothing else, which would be a bummer. The next one's a bummer, too.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Franklin</h4><p begin="00:10:43.90" data-timestamp="643.9"> It's the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself. That's really sad. If that was the reason, that would be really sad.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:10:51.75" data-timestamp="651.75"> Let me remind you that Fermi, when he asked this question, was at Los Alamos. They just built the first atomic bombs. They were about to build the first hydrogen bombs, which would be thousands of times more powerful. That leads us nicely to the next possibility.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Franklin</h4><p begin="00:11:05.90" data-timestamp="665.9"> It is the nature of intelligent life to destroy others. That would also be sad.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:11:10.59" data-timestamp="670.59"> Another possible explanation was called the Inflation Hypothesis and the Youngness Argument. Neither of us could understand the physics of that one. Something to do with synchronous gauge probability distribution. This one made sense, though.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Franklin</h4><p begin="00:11:24.34" data-timestamp="684.34"> Everyone is listening. No one is transmitting. Yeah, I guess it takes less energy to listen than to transmit.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:11:35.39" data-timestamp="695.39"> Oh, that's a good point.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Franklin</h4><p begin="00:11:36.64" data-timestamp="696.64"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:11:37.43" data-timestamp="697.43"> Then there was the zoo hypothesis. Basically, that aliens have left us alone undisturbed as a kind of intergalactic nature preserve. Or this one, aliens are here right now, we just haven't figured it out. Melissa liked that one.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Franklin</h4><p begin="00:11:52.79" data-timestamp="712.79"> I mean, how would we know if cockroaches were alien or not?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:11:57.48" data-timestamp="717.48"> I mean, they have DNA. They seem very much like part of our family tree.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa  Franklin</h4><p begin="00:12:03.54" data-timestamp="723.54"> But maybe they make themselves seem like our family tree in order to live here. Because how could they live here if they weren't?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:12:10.29" data-timestamp="730.29"> Be serious for a second.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Melissa  Franklin</h4><p begin="00:12:12.32" data-timestamp="732.32"> I can't believe that you get to decide what's serious. You are so, so wrong! You go, oh, oh, stop. Oh, don't be silly.</p><p begin="00:12:23.92" data-timestamp="743.92">And you're the one bringing up the crazy things, like you're going to cry because there's no extraterrestrial intelligence. Jesus. OK.</p><p begin="00:12:32.82" data-timestamp="752.82">Let's go talk to Paul. I need to talk to Paul. I want to ask him now.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> David  Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:12:40.91" data-timestamp="760.91"> OK.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:12:43.51" data-timestamp="763.51"> Paul is Paul Horowitz. He's also a professor here, and conveniently, one of the pioneers behind the search for extraterrestrial life. He's been at it for decades.</p><p begin="00:12:55.24" data-timestamp="775.24">He did one of the early searches for extraterrestrial signals at the giant Arecibo Observatory. There is a photo of him and Carl Sagan and Steven Spielberg-- you know, Close Encounters, ET-- throwing the on switch for another telescope search for signals from other worlds. I know Paul because he taught one of my classes way back. He's 74 years old now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Franklin</h4><p begin="00:13:14.29" data-timestamp="794.29"> Paul we need your help.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:13:17.51" data-timestamp="797.51"> Paul, David Kestenbaum.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Horowitz</h4><p begin="00:13:19.12" data-timestamp="799.12"> Hi, hi, hi, hi.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:13:20.10" data-timestamp="800.1"> How are you doing?</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:13:21.11" data-timestamp="801.11"> I hadn't reached out to Paul originally because, honestly, I was intimidated. I was upset about the Fermi Paradox? I figured he'd think that was silly. But now here we were.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:13:30.09" data-timestamp="810.09"> And it crossed my mind for the first time that we might be alone. And it made me really sad. That felt like a real thing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Horowitz</h4><p begin="00:13:39.39" data-timestamp="819.39"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> David  Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:13:40.04" data-timestamp="820.04"> Did you ever go through anything like that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Horowitz</h4><p begin="00:13:44.86" data-timestamp="824.86"> No, because I don't think we're alone.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> David  Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:13:46.24" data-timestamp="826.24"> You don't?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Horowitz</h4><p begin="00:13:47.74" data-timestamp="827.74"> No, I think-- I think the Fermi Paradox is a serious question.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> David  Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:13:52.24" data-timestamp="832.24"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Horowitz</h4><p begin="00:13:54.70" data-timestamp="834.7"> I think there's probably some good answers. The unbounded time is a problem.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:13:59.23" data-timestamp="839.23"> Maybe, he says, civilizations don't last long enough to figure out how to travel between stars. Maybe they last 10,000 years or 100,000 years. And maybe traveling through space is just too onerous, the vast distances.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Horowitz</h4><p begin="00:14:11.33" data-timestamp="851.33"> Which is sad in its own way. But--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David  Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:14:12.64" data-timestamp="852.64"> Maybe civilizations live long enough to communicate with each other, he says.

Act 2, "Two Can Be as Sad as One."</p><p begin="00:23:02.92" data-timestamp="1382.92">We're in this show about loneliness. We now turn to one of the loneliest experiences a person can possibly have, and that's marriage. I think the thing that I was least prepared for in marriage is how lonely it can be, when things go badly, I mean. And there's this recording of this couple trying to get past all the stuff that's dividing them that I think illustrates really well how hard that can be and what it really means to do it.</p><p begin="00:23:26.17" data-timestamp="1406.17">This recording is from this new podcast in which a real-life therapist records her real-life sessions with real couples who've agreed to be recorded. The therapist is Esther Perel, who's also the author of the books Mating in Captivity and the upcoming, The State of Affairs.</p><p begin="00:23:40.67" data-timestamp="1420.67">I've listened to a few episodes of her podcast now, and OK, my mom was a marriage therapist. She wrote a book about her techniques and research. She did trainings for other therapists. I've been in couples counseling myself with my wife. So I know about this world, and I found listening to Perel to be completely fascinating.</p><p begin="00:23:59.10" data-timestamp="1439.1">She's a very active therapist. I think that's the best way to say it. She talks a ton, takes what the couple says to her and then says it back to them in this way where it's like she's a LeBron-level basketball player, passing the ball to them, and then urging them down the court, running alongside, and shouting encouragement and instructions and very occasional razzing along the way. She's such an intense listener that it makes interviewing her a very odd experience.

And then that's it. No more therapy. People fly in from all over for this. Perel only takes couples whose problems she thinks she can make a dent in in so little time.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:22.21" data-timestamp="1522.21"> And what can you accomplish in a two or three-hour session, where you see the people once?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Esther Perel</h4><p begin="00:25:27.94" data-timestamp="1527.94"> So much.

I mean, with many.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:26:04.71" data-timestamp="1564.71"> It can make for suspenseful listening, hearing her try to get couples to that point.

They met when the woman was just 15. They have children and grandchildren.</p><p begin="00:26:22.77" data-timestamp="1582.77">And then, three years ago, the wife discovered that her husband had been cheating on her. Not just like with one person for a few months or a few years, but widely and compulsively for most of their marriage. I mean, for decades. These were one-night stands and paying for sex, he said.</p><p begin="00:26:41.16" data-timestamp="1601.16">They both said they'd been happy together all those years in the marriage with a good sex life, and she wanted to stay together if it was at all possible because she wanted to keep what they'd had that was good. But you know, being lied to for decades, it's like it robbed her of her past. She couldn't tell what was real, what to trust. She told Perel in the session.</p><p begin="00:27:00.76" data-timestamp="1620.76">[AUDIO PLAYBACK]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:27:01.41" data-timestamp="1621.41"> So yeah, I mean, we had a good marriage and that's why I'm still here.

He was the best father ever, always there with our children, always loving to me.</p><p begin="00:27:14.46" data-timestamp="1634.46">And I don't doubt for one second that he didn't love me with all of his heart. I never knew anything was wrong.

Why not believe him? He's never done anything to cause me to mistrust him. Now I look at him, and if he tells me this pen is red, I will turn it 15 different ways today.

He grew up in a violent home, saw his mother regularly beaten by his dad, was beaten himself, and witnessed way more than he could absorb or handle as a kid.</p><p begin="00:28:12.33" data-timestamp="1692.33">Perel tells him there are lots of boys who go through that, and then grow up, split their personalities in half, like he'd done, treat women one way when they were away from home, and then be super responsible with their families when they are home. He seems kind of wrecked in the recording.

Honestly, I have not any idea what you're saying.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Matt  Salyer</h4><p begin="00:47:39.25" data-timestamp="2859.25"> Yeah. I mean, I really don't understand half of what I just said either, right? To be honest.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Stephanie   Foo</h4><p begin="00:47:46.02" data-timestamp="2866.02"> What his answers do have going for them is sincerity. The time one ends like this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Salyer</h4><p begin="00:47:53.87" data-timestamp="2873.87"> "And one of my favorite stories by a guy named William Faulkner. There was a daddy who gives his kid a watch and says, "I give you this watch, not that you might remember time, but so that you might forget it for a little while." I can only tell you that time is me turning and turning while the world is turning around a star that turns around a center that turns around the whole time. Among all the other things and the little turning animals and all the little turning worlds, there's me trying to turn to you."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie  Foo</h4><p begin="00:48:26.31" data-timestamp="2906.31"> OK. And you just told her this answer like this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Salyer</h4><p begin="00:48:31.14" data-timestamp="2911.14"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:48:32.69" data-timestamp="2912.69"> And she?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Salyer</h4><p begin="00:48:33.76" data-timestamp="2913.76"> I mean, she would pass in and out of being interested in it. And at the end of it, she was just like, oh, yeah. OK.</p><p begin="00:48:43.67" data-timestamp="2923.67">And I'm like, all right, well, I mean, do you see what I'm saying about time? It's a measurement of change. It's an arbitrary human construct, but not, but it feels different. It's this phenomenon. She's like, yeah, yeah, OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Rosie  Salyer</h4><p begin="00:48:57.64" data-timestamp="2937.64"> I was like, oh. Well, this isn't really exactly what I wanted.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:49:02.35" data-timestamp="2942.35"> That's not what you wanted because you were like, oh, this is kind of boring?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:49:05.77" data-timestamp="2945.77"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:49:06.49" data-timestamp="2946.49"> Rosie has a pixie cut and a cheeky grin. She gave her dad the 50 questions three years ago. She's 12 now. He's been working on getting her answers, but he's only gone through 2/3 of them because it takes him so long to cobble together a response. What I found out talking to Rosie is she didn't even really care about the answers to these questions.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:49:26.83" data-timestamp="2966.83"> Questions that I thought that would take him a long time to answer, because at the time I really just wanted to talk to him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie  Foo</h4><p begin="00:49:33.12" data-timestamp="2973.12"> It all started when she first moved to New York City. Before then, she'd been living with her mom and grandparents most of the week. But then her grandpa, who she was really close to, died, and she had to move in with her dad during the week instead. At the same time, she started at a new school, where the kids either ignored or bullied her, and she felt lost. One day, she came home from school and decided she needed to do something about it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:49:57.25" data-timestamp="2997.25"> I was lonely. And I felt a little sad that nobody had really stepped out to say, oh, hey. It's gonna be OK. I'll be your friend. So that's when I really, really needed somebody to talk to.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:50:13.93" data-timestamp="3013.93"> So you didn't have anybody to talk to at school?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:50:16.12" data-timestamp="3016.12"> No.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:50:17.12" data-timestamp="3017.12"> And then at home?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:50:18.82" data-timestamp="3018.82"> No. That's really why I felt like, oh, this is my dad. He's a really important person. I love him very much. I really want to become closer with him. I wish there was something that I could do to make us closer.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:50:31.78" data-timestamp="3031.78"> Did you feel like your dad wasn't paying enough attention to you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:50:35.83" data-timestamp="3035.83"> Yeah, a little bit. Or not a little bit. Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:50:39.79" data-timestamp="3039.79"> What was he doing instead?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie  Salyer</h4><p begin="00:50:41.37" data-timestamp="3041.37"> He was writing papers on his computer. And I knew at the time how important it was, but part of me still wished that-- like, put down all the screens. Put down everything else and just talk.</p><p begin="00:50:58.73" data-timestamp="3058.73">So I wrote all the questions down, and they were big questions because I know my dad. And if it's a little question, he'll elaborate on it, and he'll make it a big deal. So if you times that by a big, complex question, that would be a huge talk.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:51:19.40" data-timestamp="3079.4"> Is it true that you weren't talking to her much at the time?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Salyer</h4><p begin="00:51:23.22" data-timestamp="3083.22"> No, I think I was talking to her all the time. You know, I would tell it was time to get up and go to school. I would tell her that it was time to do her homework. I would tell her that she needed a new jacket. Yeah, I mean, I talked to you all the time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie  Foo</h4><p begin="00:51:38.14" data-timestamp="3098.14"> Maybe you're noticing the purely logistical nature of everything he mentioned? It certainly didn't get past Rosie.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Salyer</h4><p begin="00:51:44.65" data-timestamp="3104.65"> I talked to you all the time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:51:46.69" data-timestamp="3106.69"> Yeah, but to me, it's not really the same thing. So a conversation and talking are completely different things. Talking could be a range from, oh, hey, what's up? And conversation is you're deep in thought and you're looking, and you're making eye contact, and you're really enjoying the presence of somebody else.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie  Foo</h4><p begin="00:52:06.09" data-timestamp="3126.09"> Rosie's a smart kid, yeah, but this is the thing I really admire about her. Matt was a single dad with two kids, going to school and trying to make the rent at the same time. Telling him to pay attention to her didn't cut it, so she figured out something else.</p><p begin="00:52:25.87" data-timestamp="3145.87">I read this short story recently about a successful con man, whose motto was, "make them want to give you the thing you want to take." Rosie made her dad want to give her attention by making an opportunity to do what he loved-- ponder over life's big questions.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:52:42.34" data-timestamp="3162.34"> My dad was kind of hardshelled, I guess. And so it took a lot. I had to keep asking these questions and keep wondering. For me, it was just, I had to keep going and keep trying, and keep being this little bird that goes on your shoulder and is like, I am now your friend.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:53:00.17" data-timestamp="3180.17"> Do you feel like it taught him how to talk to you better?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:53:03.92" data-timestamp="3183.92"> Yeah, definitely. Over the past three years, we've really worked on having actual conversations, than him just answering questions from me because we practice it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Stephanie       Foo</h4><p begin="00:53:18.53" data-timestamp="3198.53"> Rosie never knew that her dad spent months and months writing down each answer. Matt only told her when I started working on this story. And she said she felt like, what? Are you kidding me?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:53:34.11" data-timestamp="3214.11"> I had no idea that he was doing all these things, and it was just a big surprise for me. If I could, I would definitely just say, forget the questions. I just wanna talk.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> Stephanie  Foo</h4><p begin="00:53:44.47" data-timestamp="3224.47"> So you're like, well, you don't even have to go through all that trouble.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:53:48.60" data-timestamp="3228.6"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:53:49.17" data-timestamp="3229.17"> Just hang out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:53:50.12" data-timestamp="3230.12"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie  Foo</h4><p begin="00:53:50.86" data-timestamp="3230.86"> Rosie said this to her dad when she found out, and it really threw him for a loop.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Salyer</h4><p begin="00:53:55.68" data-timestamp="3235.68"> Yeah, it was a complete waste of time. I mean, what a complete waste of time to come up with these big, extensive projects that are definitely less important to them than just listening to them.</p><p begin="00:54:11.98" data-timestamp="3251.98">You know, what is time? Why? Explain. Well, I can tell you what I don't want time to be. I don't want time to be something where I am just figuring out that I need to shut up and make some time to listen to this little kid before it's too late.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie  Foo</h4><p begin="00:54:31.48" data-timestamp="3271.48"> Rosie really started asking the questions because she wanted to know that she wasn't alone and that everything was going to be OK. Now she enjoys hearing the answers because they remind her that that's true. That's why one of her favorite answers is the ending of, Time? Why? Explain. The part about all of the planets turning around themselves, and in the middle of it, Matt turning towards Rosie.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:54:56.42" data-timestamp="3296.42"> One of the main meanings of that is, even though everything is happening around you, he just wants to know about me a little more, I guess. And a thing that I really like about that is because he just uses these sentences that make me happy when I read them.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:55:15.85" data-timestamp="3315.85"> You know, it's kinda funny, when he read this to me he sort of choked up a little bit.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Rosie  Salyer</h4><p begin="00:55:22.60" data-timestamp="3322.6"> Yeah. He likes to be a one expression person. But when he reads stuff like this he gets all emotional. In the car ride here he was like, oh, I love you so much. And he was tearing up looking out the window, so--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:55:41.21" data-timestamp="3341.21"> You look so happy about that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:55:44.15" data-timestamp="3344.15"> Yeah. Pretty great.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie  Foo</h4><p begin="00:55:46.57" data-timestamp="3346.57"> So people have been asking these big important questions like, why are we here, what is life, for forever. And do you think that the real big reason why we ask it is to have a reason to talk to each other?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:56:12.57" data-timestamp="3372.57"> No, I think that philosophers actually really do wonder about these things. And they don't use it so that they could talk to their dads more. They use it because they really wonder about these things and they want to know everything. But for my personal use, yes. That's exactly it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:56:29.34" data-timestamp="3389.34"> Matt does still want to keep answering Rosie's questions for her. But as for the hardest question, what is love, I don't think Rosie needs her dad to explain that to her anymore. She gets it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira        Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:41.95" data-timestamp="3401.95"> Stephanie Foo is one of the producers of our program.</p></div>  </div>
