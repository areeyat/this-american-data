  <h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.85" data-timestamp="0.85"> In Israel last week, Eli Albag wanted to do something about his daughter, Liri, who had been captured by Hamas a year ago when she was 18 and is still a hostage somewhere in Gaza. And so he took a bullhorn and went to stand outside an event that was being held by the prime minister's political party, Likud. Basically, he wanted the people running the country to make some kind of deal with Hamas and bring his daughter home.</p><p begin="00:00:24.19" data-timestamp="24.19">And so, OK, he's standing there with his bullhorn, this grieving, worried parent, who doesn't know if he's ever going to see his child again. And someone throws an egg at him, and another egg. Somebody yells and calls him a cancer on Israel. Somebody else accuses him of being funded by Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:00:43.10" data-timestamp="43.1"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:46.15" data-timestamp="46.15"> This is not unusual in Israel. The country is bitterly divided between people like these hostage families, who are saying stop the fighting, make a deal with Hamas, bring home the hostages, and on the other side, the prime minister's supporters and his coalition, people running the government, who want to press on with the war and get to a more complete victory over Hamas.</p><p begin="00:01:06.58" data-timestamp="66.58">I have an Israeli friend who said to me that this war is different from ones in the past in Israel, because in the past, he said, once the war started, everybody united. This time, it's driven people further apart, to the point where even these anguished families, who you'd think would have universal sympathy in a country at war, are the target of all kinds of hate.</p><p begin="00:01:25.08" data-timestamp="85.08">Some other examples-- a real estate mogul, who's also a big Likud supporter, writes tweets that call for the death of the mother of one of the hostages. Or here's a video that was posted online of an Israeli right-winger on a motorcycle, who pulls over next to a group of hostage families and tells them, "You're going to be murdered. I'm going to murder you. Mark my words."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:01:46.30" data-timestamp="106.3"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p><p begin="00:01:49.69" data-timestamp="109.69"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:51.63" data-timestamp="111.63"> So in Israel, supporting the hostages for so many people has come to mean that you oppose the Israeli government and the way that they're conducting the war, and you want a ceasefire and a deal with Hamas. I think here in the United States, we have a different picture of the hostages and what they stand for.</p><p begin="00:02:07.41" data-timestamp="127.41">Here, I think there's this feeling that if you support the hostages, you support the war, and the current Israeli government, and the way it's conducted that war, with all the bombings and death. The hostages are a symbol, but a symbol that means different things to different people in the US and Israel.</p><p begin="00:02:25.98" data-timestamp="145.98">It's been a year since the hostages were taken. The current conflict with Hamas began last October 7 with the killing of 1,200 people and the kidnapping of 251 others. So much has happened since then, of course. Israel killed over 40,000 Palestinians. 90% of the population, almost 2 million Palestinians, have been displaced from their homes.</p><p begin="00:02:46.83" data-timestamp="166.83">This past week, Israel expanded the war to Lebanon with a ground invasion. Iran sent missiles in response, and the White House has been scrambling to try to stop a full-out regional war. At this point, this war is about so many other things than the hostages.</p><p begin="00:03:00.99" data-timestamp="180.99">But those 251 people, 117 of them released or rescued, 70 dead, and 64 who are presumed alive and in captivity, are still this symbol. They're on posters that people put up and other people tear down. They're on Bring Them Home bracelets. But they're also people, each having their own personal and specific experience of this war, an experience that politics flattens and wipes away.</p><p begin="00:03:31.57" data-timestamp="211.57">Just two weeks after the Hamas attack, very early on, an 85-year-old hostage named Yocheved Lifshitz was released and sent home. And Israelis were pretty excited. They did a press conference from the hospital. She was put on live TV in a wheelchair. Her daughter helped her hear the questions and give answers. Somebody asked, when Hamas released you, why did you shake the Hamas guy's hand? Her reply--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:03:54.04" data-timestamp="234.04"> Because they treated us very nicely. My mom is saying that they were very delicate and gentle with them and took care of all their needs.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:05.17" data-timestamp="245.17"> Television commentators and newspaper columnists jumped in, calling this press conference a disaster, a propaganda win for Hamas, an embarrassment for the hospital. Mind you, Lifshitz also said a lot of awful things about Hamas in her abduction-- attackers running rampant, beating people young and old. They hit her in the ribs with a wooden pole.</p><p begin="00:04:23.26" data-timestamp="263.26">But the story that came out of the press conference was that she said something nice about Hamas. Within a month, the hospital's spokesman who organized the press conference was out of the job. There are certain things that Israelis just did not want to hear right then.</p><p begin="00:04:36.56" data-timestamp="276.56">Here at our program, throughout this year, we've tried to document what this war has been for Palestinians and also for Israelis. And this week, a year after those people became hostages, we thought it might be a good time to hear about their actual lived experiences, all the complicated parts that don't fit neatly into some symbolic picture of them.</p><p begin="00:04:56.69" data-timestamp="296.69">There are these long interviews that an Israeli journalist, Lee Naim, has been doing with hostages who've been released on a daily news podcast called <i>Echad</i> <i>Bayom--</i> <i>One</i> <i>a</i> <i>Day.</i> In these interviews, you get to hear them just talking at length. They're not a sound bite, not an image on a poster. You hear what really happened, the complexity of what they went through and what they saw and felt.</p><p begin="00:05:18.11" data-timestamp="318.11">One of the things that's especially interesting, I think, to hear is the hostages' stories about their interactions with the people holding them captive, who, I have to say, they come across with way more dimension than I might have guessed.</p><p begin="00:05:31.04" data-timestamp="331.04">So, most of this hour, we're going to be hearing from one of the <i>Echad</i> <i>Bayom</i> interviewees, a woman named Chen Almog-Goldstein. And then when we get to the second half of the show, we're going to hear from a few of the other hostages who were interviewed. I hope you stick around. From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Part One: The Abduction</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:03.12" data-timestamp="363.12"> It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> Part one, The Abduction. Just a heads up-- if you're listening with kids, some of this gets intense. So, Chen Almog-Goldstein lived in a kibbutz called Kfar Aza, about two miles from the Gaza border, with her husband, Nadav, and their four children. She and Nadav met in junior high school. She worked as a social worker for a while but then focused on raising her kids.</p><p begin="00:06:27.31" data-timestamp="387.31">The morning of October 7, sirens went off, and they went to the safe room in their house. One of the things that a lot of people talk about in these interviews is how mystified they were that the army did not show up. For many Israelis, that is the second astonishing thing that happened that morning, that the military forces Israelis trust to keep them safe didn't arrive for over eight hours for reasons that still haven't been formally investigated.</p><p begin="00:06:50.08" data-timestamp="410.08">Chen's family stayed in the safe room for five hours. Then, men entered the house, reached where they were, shot her husband, Nadav, in the chest, she says, right in front of them. Soon after that, they shot her oldest daughter, Yam, in the face. Yam was 20 and home on leave from her mandatory military service. Chen says the last time she saw Yam, she was flailing on the floor.</p><p begin="00:07:11.11" data-timestamp="431.11">Then Chen and her three other children were led outside. There was her 17-year-old daughter, Agam, and also her two sons, who were younger, 11 and 9.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chen Almog-Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:07:20.78" data-timestamp="440.78"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p><p begin="00:07:22.94" data-timestamp="442.94"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:07:25.63" data-timestamp="445.63"> They led us to Nadav's car, first to Nadav's car and then to my car. They tried to start Nadav's car, but his car, when it's starting, it's very quiet. If you don't know the car, you probably wouldn't understand. So they probably thought, it's not working. And they brought the keys to my car, and we got into my car.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chen Almog-Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:07:42.04" data-timestamp="462.04"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p><p begin="00:07:44.48" data-timestamp="464.48"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:07:46.30" data-timestamp="466.3"> And I'm looking to the bushes, still hoping that maybe someone will signal to me with their finger. Maybe I tell the kids to escape. But on the other hand, it was dangerous. I remember realizing this is very crucial, what I decide right now. I was afraid. They had us now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chen Almog-Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:08:03.80" data-timestamp="483.8"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:08:07.63" data-timestamp="487.63"> I remember the kids' faces on the way to Gaza, very deep, terrified looks at me. I remember they asked me what happened to my lips, the boys. My lips were probably white. I was shocked. I was completely shocked.</p><p begin="00:08:25.85" data-timestamp="505.85">And I'm in the car with the kids on the way to Gaza. And I need to understand and figure out that-- it was really important for me to tell the kids first that Yam is not with us anymore, and Nadav probably isn't as well.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lee Naim</h4><p begin="00:08:39.30" data-timestamp="519.3"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Do the terrorists say anything?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chen Almog-Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:08:42.59" data-timestamp="522.59"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:08:43.85" data-timestamp="523.85"> They're happy. They're very happy. I remember the driver and the guy next to him, they're filming us. I remember we were putting our heads down, Agam and me. Then they stopped near the fence. It was their fence already because it was after some drive through the fields. And they piled dead bodies on my car. I remember Agam telling the boys to look away.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chen Almog-Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:09:07.70" data-timestamp="547.7"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:09:09.86" data-timestamp="549.86"> And after seven minutes, we're in Gaza. It's unbearable how easy it was and how fast. I mean, first of all, we were in shock. I was in shock.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:20.66" data-timestamp="560.66"> Chen said this a couple of times in her interview. The part of what was so stunning about being taken hostage was how quick it was. One minute, she was in her home. Minutes later, she's in Gaza, in captivity.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chen Almog-Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:09:31.02" data-timestamp="571.02"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:09:34.16" data-timestamp="574.16"> I remember like a deserted area. There are papers flying in the air.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chen Almog-Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:09:39.90" data-timestamp="579.9"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p><p begin="00:09:42.85" data-timestamp="582.85"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:09:44.84" data-timestamp="584.84"> And then they stopped my car. They put us in another car. We drive for a little more. And then a gate opens. The car goes in, and the gate closes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:57.56" data-timestamp="597.56"> They're at a private home. That's where the car stops. Chen say that her kids, till then, had held it together.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chen Almog-Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:10:04.35" data-timestamp="604.35"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:10:05.57" data-timestamp="605.57"> That entire time, the kids were just so, so level-headed. Their conduct was so-- it was amazing. They didn't cry. They didn't do anything dangerous. They didn't yell. They didn't try to hold on to my clothes. I think they even tried to talk to the terrorists, talk to them in English.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:22.66" data-timestamp="622.66"> But now, next to this private home, they see the entrance to a tunnel.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chen Almog-Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:10:27.63" data-timestamp="627.63"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p><p begin="00:10:30.04" data-timestamp="630.04"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:10:32.47" data-timestamp="632.47"> And this is the first time that Tal-- Tal was 9 at the time. This is the first time he's crying. He saw this black hole, and he got scared. Tal cried a bit when he stared at this tunnel, but he calmed down. They brought him water. And that's it. We're going down this tunnel. It's not very deep.</p><p begin="00:10:56.02" data-timestamp="656.02">And we meet other hostages from Kfar Aza, an elderly couple, a young guy. And each is telling their own kidnapping story. And we can't believe we're in Gaza.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lee Naim</h4><p begin="00:11:08.20" data-timestamp="668.2"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Can you describe the condition in the tunnel?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chen Almog-Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:11:13.31" data-timestamp="673.31"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:11:15.35" data-timestamp="675.35"> Sand. There was sand everywhere and also in our mouth. There was a hallway that leads to this small room with some mattresses. There's constant sweeping because there's constant sand. And it's pretty hot there, 27 degrees.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:33.20" data-timestamp="693.2"> 27 degrees, that's 80 degrees Fahrenheit.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:11:35.66" data-timestamp="695.66"> And 27 degrees and very humid, very damp.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:40.48" data-timestamp="700.48"> 100 kids plus the three other hostages from the kibbutz were kept in the tunnel for two nights, she says. At one point, one of the guards brings a deck of cards to keep the kids occupied. The boys, remember, were 9 and 11. Agam's the oldest, 17.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chen Almog-Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:11:55.49" data-timestamp="715.49"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p><p begin="00:11:57.97" data-timestamp="717.97"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:11:59.42" data-timestamp="719.42"> And Agam got some sort of a panic attack. She started hyperventilating. She couldn't breathe. And so they attempted to calm her down. They said, you'll be back in Israel by Tuesday. Tuesday, you're back. And this was said on Monday. We were kidnapped on Saturday. And the truth is, I thought so, too. I thought we'll be back by Tuesday.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chen Almog-Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:12:21.30" data-timestamp="741.3"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:12:23.60" data-timestamp="743.6"> We're in Gaza with children. Israel is not going to attack. Israel is not going to do what it always does. First, they're going to free us, and then they're going to figure out what they're going to do.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:34.26" data-timestamp="754.26"> On Tuesday, they do leave the tunnel, not for Israel. They're taken to a house next to the tunnel.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chen Almog-Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:12:39.79" data-timestamp="759.79"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:12:41.55" data-timestamp="761.55"> And it's a house that is full of the sounds of kids, babies, women. And there, we can already hear the attacks. Gaza is being bombarded at this point. And then they start prepping us for another move.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:56.43" data-timestamp="776.43"> Any move through the streets, where they would be surrounded by Gazans, just random civilians, was always a production because their captors were hiding them from the Israelis, from the general public, from everybody. They didn't want people to know that there were Israeli hostages walking right beside them on the street.</p><p begin="00:13:11.76" data-timestamp="791.76">So they put Agam and Chen into full length jalabiyas and hijabs. The two boys, Gal and Tal, got hats. Then, they moved them outside. It's five days into the war. Israel's bombarding Gaza. Chen and her kids see Israeli jets flying overhead.</p><p begin="00:13:29.65" data-timestamp="809.65">Chen says she and Agam take all this in and say <i>Fauda</i> to each other. <i>Fauda's</i> a big Israeli TV series, an action show about military special ops in the West Bank and Gaza. They end up in an apartment, where they spend the next five weeks, most of their time in Gaza.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Part Two: Daily Life in Captivity</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:54.68" data-timestamp="834.68"> Part Two, Daily Life in Captivity. So different hostages say they were held by different militant groups in all sorts of locations and all sorts of conditions. Some hostages who have been released said they were beaten or sexually assaulted.</p><p begin="00:14:10.18" data-timestamp="850.18">Chen's family is now in a residential apartment building guarded by two men, who very much wanted to keep them a secret from all the civilians living around them on all sides, which had lots of consequences for the way they lived. Chen remembers it being really hot in that apartment. They had an electric fan, but electricity was only on for an hour or two a day.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:14:29.96" data-timestamp="869.96"> So it's very hard without the fan when the windows are pretty much closed. There are heavy curtains on the windows, and we weren't allowed to go near them. We weren't allowed-- they keep opening them, closing them, open, close. They don't want anyone to hear us, even people just in the building or, of course, people on the streets.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chen Almog-Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:14:48.02" data-timestamp="888.02"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:14:51.34" data-timestamp="891.34"> I remember it was very hard for me to fall asleep there. I was always the last one, always tossing and turning because you're sweating there the whole time. Everything is wet. You're just soaked in sweat.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chen Almog-Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:15:02.48" data-timestamp="902.48"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p><p begin="00:15:05.45" data-timestamp="905.45"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:15:06.94" data-timestamp="906.94"> And there are bombings at night. And at that stage in this apartment where we were, they were still explaining to us, this is bombings from the sky. This is from the sea. This is artillery. And when the house shook, they would move with us, sway with us. And we were on-- I don't know which floor-- maybe fifth?</p><p begin="00:15:27.35" data-timestamp="927.35">At that stage, at least, they would say, bida bida, like it's far. You hear the whistle. You know the fall is going to be far. They were trying to tell us it's going to be OK. It's far. They tried to calm us down. They wanted us to be OK.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:15:41.40" data-timestamp="941.4"> Living among the Palestinians, the Israeli hostages suffered through some of the same hardships of the war. Many hostages in their interviews talk about how hungry they were. The captors tried to give them two meals a day.</p><p begin="00:15:52.98" data-timestamp="952.98">As the Israeli bombing campaign progressed, of course, and the army rolled in, food and water got harder and harder to get in Gaza, to the point where now Gaza is on the edge of famine, according to the United Nations.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:16:03.60" data-timestamp="963.6"> Water, they tried to provide drinking water. You can't drink water from the tap. First of all, there isn't like a steady flow of water. Sometimes there's just a drip, and it's basically salt water.</p><p begin="00:16:16.98" data-timestamp="976.98">Bathroom, very difficult. Bathrooms, you can't just flush the water. Maybe we had it in the first two days, but then we couldn't flush the water. There was a really bad smell in the bathrooms.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:16:30.15" data-timestamp="990.15"> When power would come on for an hour, sometimes, she says, they'd get running water. And then they had to decide who could shower-- guards or some of them. Agam, the teenager, really wanted to wash her hair. With all that competition, Chen says, she pretty much gave up on showers for herself.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chen Almog-Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:16:46.14" data-timestamp="1006.14"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p><p begin="00:16:47.61" data-timestamp="1007.61"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:16:50.19" data-timestamp="1010.19"> I felt very strange in Gaza physically, the whole stay in Gaza.
