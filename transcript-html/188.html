  <h3>Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.55" data-timestamp="0.55"> Rebecca remembers exactly when she learned the astonishing truth. She was in second grade and ran to her best friend Rachel at school one day.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rebecca</h4><p begin="00:00:07.36" data-timestamp="7.36"> And she pulled me aside and said, "last night I lost a tooth, and I woke up while the tooth fairy was putting the money under my pillow. And guess who the tooth fairy was." I said, "oh my god, who was it? I have to know." And she said, "my dad. My dad is the tooth fairy."</p><p begin="00:00:29.32" data-timestamp="29.32">And I remember running home after school and telling my mom, "mom, I know who the tooth fairy is," and declaring it as if I had grown up that I knew who the tooth fairy was. And she said, "oh, well, who is the tooth fairy?" And I turned to her and I said, "Rachel's dad is the tooth fairy. Ronnie Loeberfeld is the tooth fairy."</p><p begin="00:00:58.23" data-timestamp="58.23">And she said, "I can't believe you know. It's totally secret. You can't let anyone else know.</p><p begin="00:01:04.05" data-timestamp="64.05">But you're right, Ronnie is the tooth fairy, and he works really hard. And it's a secret, so you can't let anyone else know. He is the tooth fairy, but you can't let anyone else know." And from that day on, Ronnie Loeberfeld was the tooth fairy, and all of my notes under my pillow were signed "Love, Ronnie Loeberfeld."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:26.86" data-timestamp="86.86"> Now, in his day job, what did Ronnie Loeberfeld do?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rebecca</h4><p begin="00:01:31.48" data-timestamp="91.48"> I think he did something in finance. He was either an accountant or a stockbroker. He worked next to a Stop &amp; Shop in Massachusetts, in Newton. Had dark hair, wore a suit, and I definitely had images of his driving his Volvo around the Boston area and delivering the tooth fairy treats.</p><p begin="00:01:57.15" data-timestamp="117.15">I remember wondering what it was like for Rachel to know that her dad was the tooth fairy, and definitely being a little envious that her dad had this special job and this special power, and that he had this whole other interesting life, where my dad just came home from work, and that was it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:14.16" data-timestamp="134.16"> So when you would actually run into Ronnie Loeberfeld, what was it like for you? How would you act?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rebecca</h4><p begin="00:02:20.01" data-timestamp="140.01"> I tried to act cool. I didn't want to-- you know, it's like if you're starstruck but you don't want them to know that you're star struck?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:25.41" data-timestamp="145.41"> Just like meeting a celebrity?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rebecca</h4><p begin="00:02:26.79" data-timestamp="146.79"> Exactly. You downplay it. You try not to mention it, but you definitely check them out twice and look at them when they walk away. Like, oh my god, you're the tooth fairy.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:37.56" data-timestamp="157.56"> But you knew enough to play it cool.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rebecca</h4><p begin="00:02:38.83" data-timestamp="158.83"> I knew enough to play it cool. I said, hey, how are you doing. What's for dinner? How am I getting home tonight? Are my parents going to pick me up if they call?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:49.71" data-timestamp="169.71"> You did play it cool.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:02:55.21" data-timestamp="175.21"> One interesting question in all this. Why did both girls come to what seems like the least likely conclusion from the evidence in front of them, of a parent swapping money for a tooth under a pillow? Well, Alison Gopnik studies how children think, and she says, of course it's logical for a seven-year-old to conclude that her own father might be the tooth fairy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alison Gopnik</h4><p begin="00:03:14.32" data-timestamp="194.32"> Children understand that their parents, for instance, are powerful in all sorts of ways that make them very different from children. Now, from a child's point of view, knowing where those powers begin and end is pretty tricky. I mean, think about all the things that your parents can do that you can't do, and think about the fact that there isn't any obvious explanation about why your father can use a Visa card, for instance.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:36.34" data-timestamp="216.34"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alison Gopnik</h4><p begin="00:03:36.95" data-timestamp="216.95"> Which is something that you can't do. The power to be a tooth fairy isn't all that much more impressive.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:49.78" data-timestamp="229.78"> There's a certain kind of story that kids tell, like the Ronnie Loeberfeld story, where they look at something going on around them, observe it carefully, think about it logically, how one thing connects to the next, and then come to conclusions that are completely incorrect. Therapist Eileen Goldman in Texas tells this story about a little girl on an airplane.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Eileen Goldman</h4><p begin="00:04:07.87" data-timestamp="247.87"> And she was about four years old, and her very first flight. And as the plane was airborne, she turned to the woman next to her and said, when do we get smaller? That had been her experience at airports watching airplanes take off-- they do get smaller.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:31.64" data-timestamp="271.64"> These stories are like jokes, and they're also like poems, I think because there's this "a-ha" quality to them. Some connection is made between things-- a surprising connection, a wrong connection, actually. And part of what makes these so satisfying as stories is that the logic in them is perfectly reasonable and, at the same time, completely and utterly wrong.</p><p begin="00:04:51.56" data-timestamp="291.56">We at <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i> love these stories, and so today we bring you a full hour of them. From WBEC Chicago and Public Radio International, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass.</p><p begin="00:05:02.45" data-timestamp="302.45">Today on our show, Kid Logic, our show in four acts. Act One, Baby Scientists with Faulty Data. Act Two, The Game Ain't Over Till the Fatso Man Sings. In that act we hear one boy's explanation of how love works.</p><p begin="00:05:17.93" data-timestamp="317.93">Act Three, Werewolves in Their Youth. That story on the gap between adult and kid logic from Michael Chabon. Act Four, One Brain Shrinks, One Brain Grows. The story of a dad who's sick, his four-year-old boy, and the perhaps not very helpful lessons of <i>The</i> <i>Lion</i> <i>King.</i> Stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

<div class="act" id="act1">
  <h3>Act One: Baby Scientists With Faulty Data</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:45.54" data-timestamp="345.54"> Act One, Baby Scientists with Faulty Data.</p><p begin="00:05:49.20" data-timestamp="349.2">30 years ago, psychologists and scientists believed that babies could not think at all, that they were irrational and illogical, self-centered little balls of need and want. What science has learned in the last 30 years is that this is not true, that children are observing the world and thinking about it and coming to logical conclusions from the day they're born.</p><p begin="00:06:09.46" data-timestamp="369.46">And Alison Gopnik and two of her colleagues decided to summarize a lot of this research in a book. They called it <i>The</i> <i>Scientist</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>Crib,</i> meaning that babies are like little scientists. They argue that when a small baby sits in a highchair and drops a spoon onto the floor over and over and over for mom or dad to pick up, what the baby is doing essentially is running a little baby-sized experiment.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alison Gopnik</h4><p begin="00:06:31.17" data-timestamp="391.17"> Because it turns out that babies are very interested in gravity, and how gravity works. The fact that things fall down and not up is not obvious to babies. And it turns out another thing they're very interested in is human beings and how they work. We are actually the lab rats. They're actually doing experiments on us to see how we tick.</p><p begin="00:06:51.60" data-timestamp="411.6">So when you play "drop the spoon," you get two for the price of one. You get an experiment about gravity, you get a little physics tutorial, and you get a psychology tutorial. You can see about how that person will do something over and over again.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:08.69" data-timestamp="428.69"> While kids think with the same logic that adults use and apply that logic just as rigorously, there are certain things that they simply do not know and take a while to figure out. Up to six or seven years old, for instance, it's not exactly clear to anyone what is imaginary and what is not, or if wishing for something can make it come true.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alison Gopnik</h4><p begin="00:07:28.64" data-timestamp="448.64"> There's a wonderful experiment about this, actually, that Paul Harris in England did, where he got children to imagine that something was in a box. So he would say, OK, now here's this box. We're going to open it up. We're going to close it.</p><p begin="00:07:43.19" data-timestamp="463.19">Now let's imagine that there's a puppy in this box, or else let's imagine that there's a monster in the box. And he asked the children, is there really a monster in the box? Is there really a puppy in the box? They said, no, they were just imagining it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:56.33" data-timestamp="476.33"> Then the researcher would walk out of the room, leaving the box behind with the child, and then something funny would happen. The kids who were told to imagine a puppy in the box would go over and peek inside the box, just to check. And the kids who were told that there was a monster in the box, they would edge away from the box.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alison Gopnik</h4><p begin="00:08:15.73" data-timestamp="495.73"> So they weren't going to take any chances, just in case wishing actually could make monsters happen. They didn't want to take any chances about what was going on in that box. But by the time the children are six or seven, like grownups, they've understood that just wishing for things isn't going to actually make them happen.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:36.82" data-timestamp="516.82"> When they're still small and inexperienced about what happens in the real world, children have to make logical inferences all the time based on the data that they do have. Here is how children responded when our producer Jonathan Goldstein asked them about the tooth fairy.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:08:52.34" data-timestamp="532.34"> What do you think she does with all of these teeth that she's collecting?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:08:56.47" data-timestamp="536.47"> Maybe she gives it to the people without teeth.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:08:58.99" data-timestamp="538.99"> Like who?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:09:00.41" data-timestamp="540.41"> Old people.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:09:02.08" data-timestamp="542.08"> What do you think she does with all these teeth?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:09:04.69" data-timestamp="544.69"> I really think she just likes to collect teeth and make things out of them.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:09:08.45" data-timestamp="548.45"> Like what kind of stuff?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:09:10.43" data-timestamp="550.43"> Lots of stuff. Makes a tooth house, a tooth trophy, and a tooth desk.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:09:19.57" data-timestamp="559.57"> How many teeth do you think it takes to make a tooth house?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:09:22.76" data-timestamp="562.76"> 100.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl</h4><p begin="00:09:24.49" data-timestamp="564.49"> 100.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:09:25.69" data-timestamp="565.69"> Why wouldn't she just make the house out of bricks like everyone else?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl</h4><p begin="00:09:29.92" data-timestamp="569.92"> Because I don't-- because no one doesn't have brick teeth.</p><p begin="00:09:34.54" data-timestamp="574.54">[MUSIC PLAYING]</p><p begin="00:09:38.87" data-timestamp="578.87"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:43.21" data-timestamp="583.21"> These stories where kids take a perfectly logical premise and go through a series of perfectly logical deductions that lead to perfectly incorrect conclusions. Turns out that science does not have a name for these stories, which is surprising, given how common they are and how they are recognized around the world for their sheer entertainment value. Here, we've collected a few more.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:10:05.14" data-timestamp="605.14"> We lived in a duplex. The duplexes directly to the left and the right of use were aunts and uncles, across the street from us, all aunts and uncles, so there was no such thing as walking out and seeing a stranger. I just thought we all looked alike, we all had common ancestries.</p><p begin="00:10:19.84" data-timestamp="619.84">Well, when I became mobile, when I got my first tricycle, I could go a little bit further, so I ventured down the street. And I looked, and I saw this couple sitting there, these two people, but there were people that I had never seen before. I'd never seen anything like that, because they were white people. And because I had never seen white people, I assumed that they were ghosts.</p><p begin="00:10:42.89" data-timestamp="642.89">So I waved, like, I wonder if I wave what kind of people are they? What do they do? Do they talk?</p><p begin="00:10:48.31" data-timestamp="648.31">So I waved, and I remember hearing the man going [HACKING COUGH] and I thought, wow, that must be the way they talk. It was like a scientific discovery-- like, I discovered the first ghost people and they talked to me. I communicated. I waved, they waved. I said hello, and they said hello in their language. [COUGHING]</p><p begin="00:11:16.81" data-timestamp="676.81"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:11:19.18" data-timestamp="679.18"> Well, it all began at Christmas two years ago when my daughter was four years old. And it was the first time that she had ever asked about what did this holiday mean. And so I explained to her that this was celebrating the birth of Jesus. And she wanted to know more about that, and we went out and bought a kid's Bible and had these readings at night. She loved them, wanted to know everything about Jesus.</p><p begin="00:11:51.54" data-timestamp="711.54">So we read a lot about his birth and about his teaching. And she would ask constantly what that phrase was, and I would explain to her that it was "do unto others as you would have them do unto you." And we would talk about those old words and what that all meant.</p><p begin="00:12:11.55" data-timestamp="731.55">And then one day we were driving past a big church, and out front was an enormous crucifix. She said, who is that? And I guess I'd never really told that part of the story. [LAUGHS] So I had to sort of, "yeah, well, that's Jesus, and I forgot to tell you the ending. Yeah, well, he ran afoul of the Roman government. This message that he had was so radical and unnerving to the prevailing authorities at the time that they had to kill him. They came to the conclusion that he would have to die. That message was too troublesome."</p><p begin="00:12:57.04" data-timestamp="777.04">It was about a month later after that Christmas, we had gone through the whole story of what Christmas meant. And it was mid-January, and her preschool celebrates the same holidays as the local schools, so Martin Luther King Day was off. So I knocked off work that day, and I decided we'd play and I'd take her out to lunch.</p><p begin="00:13:19.78" data-timestamp="799.78">And we were sitting in there, and right on the table where we happened to plop down was the art section of the local newspaper, and there, big-as-life, was a huge drawing by a 10-year-old kid in the local schools of Martin Luther King. And she said, "who's that?" And I said, "Well, as it happens, that's Martin Luther King, and he's why you're not in school today. So we're celebrating his birthday. This is the day we celebrate his life."</p><p begin="00:13:51.61" data-timestamp="831.61">And she said, "so who is he?" I said, "well, he was a preacher." And she looks up at me and goes, "for Jesus?" And I said, "yeah, actually he was. But there was another thing that he was really famous for, which is that he had a message."</p><p begin="00:14:11.83" data-timestamp="851.83">And you're trying to say this to a four-year-old. This is the first time they ever hear anything, so you're just very careful about how you phrase everything. So I said, well, yeah, he was a preacher and he had a message. And she said, "what was his message?" I said, "well, he said that you should treat everybody the same, no matter what they look like."</p><p begin="00:14:40.52" data-timestamp="880.52">She thought about that for a minute, and she said, "well, that's what Jesus said." I said, "yeah, I guess it is. I never thought of it that way, but yeah, that is sort of like "do unto others as you would have them do unto you." And she thought for a minute and looked up at me and said, "did they kill him, too?"</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act Two: The Game Ain't Over Til The Fatso Man Sings</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:15:15.71" data-timestamp="915.71"> Act Two, The Game Ain't Over Till The Fatso Man Sings.</p><p begin="00:15:20.18" data-timestamp="920.18">When little kids talk about a crush or love, are they talking about more or less the same thing that adults mean by those words? Well, Howie Chackowicz remembers how he thought about love in grade school. He wanted girls to like him, but they never seemed to. Here he is.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Howie Chackowicz</h4><p begin="00:15:35.97" data-timestamp="935.97"> Looking back on it, I think part of the problem was how I thought about love as a kid. I had a few ideas about how you get someone to love you that, in retrospect, weren't particularly helpful to me. First, I thought that if they can see me sleeping, they would immediately fall for me.</p><p begin="00:15:51.58" data-timestamp="951.58">When I went to sleep each night, I would consciously try to sleep in a cute way, just in case the girls I like would peep on me. I'd roll into a fetal ball like a kitten and scrunch my head into my pillow, hand under my head. I imagined all the popular girls intent on cruelly pranking me got a ladder and climbed up to my bedroom window. But instead of painting "fatso" or whatever on my window as planned, their collective hearts would melt as they saw me sleeping like a babe, an angel buried snugly under my blankets. I guess it was some crossover of a kid's knowledge of what was endearing to adults applied to romance.</p><p begin="00:16:30.49" data-timestamp="990.49">My second theory was that they'd fall in love with me if they could see me reading aloud. This conclusion came out of my experience with nieces and nephews who would fawn all over me when I would read to them. By age six, I was already an uncle, and I felt this lent me a certain maturity.</p><p begin="00:16:44.80" data-timestamp="1004.8">Often, at recess time, I'd go to the back of the classroom and read from a selection of kids books. All the kids would gather round in a circle. I'd pore through books like "Percy, the Rose-Eating Donkey," affecting the voices of the different characters and speaking with a preacher's sweaty charisma.</p><p begin="00:16:59.77" data-timestamp="1019.77">I'm not sure why, but everyone in my class seemed to love the way I hammed it up. The only problem with this was, the girls in class ended up treating me like their uncle. They called me "Uncle Howie" and talk to me in baby talk. [BABY TALK] "Wead me a stowwie, Uncle Howie," so on. Don't get me wrong. I loved the attention, but I wanted love, not "wuv."</p><p begin="00:17:24.06" data-timestamp="1044.06">So I had all these ideas about love. And of all the girls I knew, my theories were most intensely targeted at one girl, the most popular girl in school, Karen. She became my most serious crush. I carried a torch for Karen from grade one to grade six.</p><p begin="00:17:40.74" data-timestamp="1060.74">Though Karen didn't seem to like me much, one thing I learned about love on TV was that if one was sincere, love can break all boundaries. I believed that there would come a moment where I'd speak the words "I love you" to Karen with such tenderness and tears that it would break her heart and she would cry, too, and confess her love. I would allow one brave tear to travel down my cheek.</p><p begin="00:18:07.96" data-timestamp="1087.96">And I was really cute then.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Karen</h4><p begin="00:18:08.74" data-timestamp="1088.74"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Howie Chackowicz</h4><p begin="00:18:09.10" data-timestamp="1089.1"> And Jonathan looked like cute Jonathan.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Karen</h4><p begin="00:18:09.97" data-timestamp="1089.97"> And Jonathan is very, very adorable.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Howie Chackowicz</h4><p begin="00:18:15.61" data-timestamp="1095.61"> Now, years later, I'm friends with Karen-- actual friends with both her and her husband, Alan. I even worked for him for a while. Karen and I have talked before about our elementary school days, usually steering the conversation towards how mean she was to me, but I've never really spoken with her about puppy love. I wanted to know what she remembered, whether she knew I even had a crush on her at all.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Howie Chackowicz</h4><p begin="00:18:36.27" data-timestamp="1116.27"> Who were your interests? We'll go year-by-year.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Karen</h4><p begin="00:18:40.35" data-timestamp="1120.35"> Keith, definitely, love interest. Barry Seller, the big one. The big one.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Howie Chackowicz</h4><p begin="00:18:48.51" data-timestamp="1128.51"> Loren Wilter?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Karen</h4><p begin="00:18:49.86" data-timestamp="1129.86"> Yes, yes!</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Howie Chackowicz</h4><p begin="00:18:50.72" data-timestamp="1130.72"> Yes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Karen</h4><p begin="00:18:51.08" data-timestamp="1131.08"> Yes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Howie Chackowicz</h4><p begin="00:18:52.17" data-timestamp="1132.17"> Notice who she doesn't mention. Even though it was so far in the past, that crush is still such an awkward thing to talk about. When I finally did tell her about how I felt about her when we were kids, I sort of mumbled my way through it, backpedaling all over the place. I even forgot to actually point the mic at her.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Howie Chackowicz</h4><p begin="00:19:08.91" data-timestamp="1148.91"> When I was in elementary school, you were like a big crush.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Karen</h4><p begin="00:19:12.06" data-timestamp="1152.06"> Aww.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Howie Chackowicz</h4><p begin="00:19:12.75" data-timestamp="1152.75"> You see?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Karen</h4><p begin="00:19:13.35" data-timestamp="1153.35"> I didn't even know that.

This was a coed game and seemed like very fun.</p><p begin="00:19:56.71" data-timestamp="1196.71">And Keith said, "I'm going to throw Karen the ball." And he goes-- you know he couldn't pronounce his "Rs"-- he goes, "you tackle her, Howie. Tackle her, tackle her hard and you'll be popular, and then everyone will like you." I'm like, "OK, I'm going to do it."</p><p begin="00:20:08.32" data-timestamp="1208.32">And I remember you were running, the sun is shining off and your hair's bouncing, and you caught the ball. And I remember I just-- I don't know what came over me. I just remember thinking, like, that's what I had to do, was I had to tackle you, and I tackled you really hard. You're on the ground. You're holding your leg. Now, any kind of logic would have dictated that's not the way to get the girl you like, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Karen</h4><p begin="00:20:28.30" data-timestamp="1228.3"> Yeah, but a lot of times the way young kids react, or show affection, is through physical-- like I was telling you before, that I wrestled with Barry, because--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Howie Chackowicz</h4><p begin="00:20:39.37" data-timestamp="1239.37"> That's right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Karen</h4><p begin="00:20:40.00" data-timestamp="1240"> --you just want to be close.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Howie Chackowicz</h4><p begin="00:20:41.53" data-timestamp="1241.53"> This is not how she felt about it at the time, because I felt the harder I tackled her, the more popular I'd be. I took her down like it was prison football. The game came to an immediate end, everyone circling Karen's writhing body, the football near her lay totally still. She was holding her leg, looking up at me, saying, "you tub of lard, you broke my leg!"</p><p begin="00:21:02.09" data-timestamp="1262.09">Karen doesn't remember any of this. She doesn't remember how she then jumped up, got four or five of her girlfriends in the huddle, and miraculously choreographed an impromptu kicking chorus line of "Fatso Men" to the tune of the Village People's "Macho Men." Fatso, fatso men, I would not like to be a fatso man. Fatso, fatso men, I would not like to be a fatso. At that point, they all through their hands up in the air in unison.</p><p begin="00:21:36.54" data-timestamp="1296.54">I remember it so perfectly, but then, after all, it was my crush. She had no recollection of the time the school photographer called her Daisy Duke and then turned around and called me Boss Hogg. Or the fitness day that I beat her in a "Chariots of Fire" style race. She didn't even remember the biggest story of them all-- our sixth grade graduation dance.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Howie Chackowicz</h4><p begin="00:21:54.24" data-timestamp="1314.24"> Now, the last dance was "Stairway to Heaven," right?

And our teacher walking up to your desk and everyone knowing what was coming, because it probably happened two days before, and the teacher just lacing into you and dumping the contents of your desk on the floor. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Howie Chackowicz</h4><p begin="00:23:32.97" data-timestamp="1412.97"> Now, when that happened, did I seem cool, like a bad boy?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Karen</h4><p begin="00:23:36.44" data-timestamp="1416.44"> [LAUGHS] No. Everyone felt very, very sad for you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Howie Chackowicz</h4><p begin="00:23:49.95" data-timestamp="1429.95"> More than anything, I wanted Karen to notice me, but not in that way. I think problem with my theories was that I expected her to fall for me the same way I fell for her. That she would see me from afar, reading to our classmates, sleeping like a little prince. I thought that's what it took for someone to fall in love.</p><p begin="00:24:06.43" data-timestamp="1446.43">I wanted her to think that this was the real me. I wanted to think it was the real me. And the truth of it was that the real, real me was getting screamed at and having his desk spilled out on the ground each day.</p><p begin="00:24:27.77" data-timestamp="1467.77">There's a way you can love a girl in grade six that you'll never have again. There's something about kids, or at least the way I was as a kid, that is purely romantic in the truest love salutatorian sense of the word. Only a year or two later, my theories in the ways of love had changed drastically. By seventh grade, I had some spin the bottle sessions under my belt and I concluded that instead of dreaming about a true love I couldn't have, I should get a little bit more pragmatic about the whole thing.</p><p begin="00:24:54.89" data-timestamp="1494.89">One night, after deciding I wanted to have a real girlfriend, I called up identical twin sisters that I liked-- Darlene and Elizabeth. Darlene answered. I told her that I liked her and asked her if she'd like to officially go out with me. She kindly told me that she only liked me as a friend, but she was flattered.</p><p begin="00:25:12.65" data-timestamp="1512.65">"No problem," I said. "Is Elizabeth home?" She passed me over to her twin, who I made the same offer to, and Elizabeth said, sure. And that was it.</p><p begin="00:25:22.85" data-timestamp="1522.85">They're identical twins. What's the difference, I figured. We went out for two more months.

  <h3>Act Three: Werewolves In Their Youth</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:26:15.93" data-timestamp="1575.93"> Act Three, Werewolves in Their Youth.</p><p begin="00:26:18.98" data-timestamp="1578.98">We have this excerpt in this act from a short story by Michael Chabon.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Michael Chabon</h4><p begin="00:26:23.56" data-timestamp="1583.56"> "I had known him as a bulldozer, as a samurai, as an android programmed to kill, as Plastic Man, and Titanium Man, and Matter-Eater Lad, as a Buick Electra, as a Peterbilt truck, and even for a week as the Mackinaw Bridge, but it was as a werewolf that Timothy Stokes finally went too far.</p><p begin="00:26:44.38" data-timestamp="1604.38">I wasn't there when it happened. I was down in the ravine at the edge of the schoolyard, founding a capital for an empire of ants. I had just begun to describe to myself and to the ants the complicated rights sacred to the God whose worship I was imposing on them when I heard the first screams from the playground.</p><p begin="00:27:04.60" data-timestamp="1624.6">The girls screamed at Timothy the same way every time he came after them-- in unison, and with a trill that sounded almost like delight, as if they were watching the family cat trot past with something bloody in its jaws. I scrambled up the side of the ravine and emerged as Timothy, shoulders hunched, arms outstretched, growled realistically and declared that he was hungry for the throats of puny humans. Timothy said this, or something like it, every time he turned into a werewolf, and I would not have been too concerned if, in the course of his last transformation, he hadn't actually gone and bitten Virginia Pease on the neck.</p><p begin="00:27:43.87" data-timestamp="1663.87">It was common knowledge around school that Virginia's parents had since written a letter to the principal that the next time Timothy Stokes hurt somebody, he was going to be expelled. Timothy was, in our teacher Mrs. Gladfelter's words, one strike away from an out. And there was a widespread, if unarticulated, hope among his classmates, their parents, and all of the teachers at Copland Fork Elementary that one day soon he would provide the authorities with the excuse they needed to pack him off to special school.</p><p begin="00:28:17.30" data-timestamp="1697.3">I stood there a while above my little city, watching Timothy pursue a snarling, lupine course along the hopscotch crosses. I knew that someone ought to do something to calm him down. But I was the only one in our school who could have any reason to want to save Timothy Stokes from expulsion, and I hated him with all my heart.</p><p begin="00:28:47.73" data-timestamp="1727.73">"I've been cursed for 300 years," he declaimed. He was wearing his standard uniform of white dungarees and a plain white undershirt, even though it was a chilly afternoon in October, and all the rest of us had long since been bundled up for autumn in corduroy and down. "I've been cursed to stalk the night through all eternity," he went on.</p><p begin="00:29:10.89" data-timestamp="1750.89">"I've been searching for prey as lovely as you!" He lunged toward the nearest wall of the cage of girls around him. The girls peeled away from him as though sprayed with a hose, bumped shoulders, clung, shrieking, to each other's sleeves.</p><p begin="00:29:26.43" data-timestamp="1766.43">Some of them were singing the song we sang about Timothy Stokes. "Timothy Stokes, Timothy Stokes, you're going to the home for crazy folks." And the one singing the loudest was Virginia Pease herself, in her furry black coat and her bright red tights.</p><p begin="00:29:43.56" data-timestamp="1783.56">Virginia had blonde hair, and she was the only girl in the fifth grade with pierced ears and painted fingernails, and Timothy Stokes was in love with her. I knew this because the Stokes's lived next door to us, and I was privy to all kinds of secrets about Timothy that I had absolutely no desire to know. I forbade myself with an almost religious severity to show Timothy any kindness or regard. I would never let him sit beside me, at lunch or in class, and if he tried to talk to me on the playground, I ignored him. It was bad enough that I had to live next door to him.</p><p begin="00:30:20.37" data-timestamp="1820.37">It was toward Virginia that Timothy now advanced a rattling growl in his throat. She drew back behind her girlfriends, and their screaming now grew less melodious, less purely formal. Timothy crouched down on all fours. He rolled his wild white eyes and took a last look around him.</p><p begin="00:30:39.96" data-timestamp="1839.96">That was when he saw me, halfway across the yellow distance of the soccer field. He was looking at me, I thought, as though he hoped I might have something I wanted to tell him. Instantly I dropped flat on my belly, my heart pounding the way it did when I was spotted trying to spy on a baseball game or a birthday party. I slid down into the ravine backward.</p><p begin="00:31:03.46" data-timestamp="1863.46">At first I could hear the girls shouting for Mrs. Gladfelter. And then I heard Mrs. Gladfelter herself, sounding very angry. And the bell sounded the end of recess and everything got very quiet, but I just stayed there in the ravine. I told myself that I didn't feel sorry at all for stupid old Timothy Stokes. But then I would remember the confused look in his eyes as I had abandoned him to his fate, to all the unimaginable things that would be done to him in the fabulous corridors of the special school.</p><p begin="00:31:34.11" data-timestamp="1894.11">I kept recalling something that I had heard Timothy's mother say to mine just a couple of days earlier. "You know," Althea Stokes had told my mother in that big, sad donkey voice of hers, "your little Paul is Timothy's only friend." I decided to spend the afternoon in the ravine. The sun started down behind the embankment, and the moon, rising early, emerged from the rooftops of the houses somebody was putting up in front of the school. The moon, I noticed, was not quite full.</p><p begin="00:32:12.83" data-timestamp="1932.83">I didn't hear the scrape of footsteps until they were just above my head. "Paul," said Mrs. Gladfelter, leaning over the lip of the ravine, hands against her thighs. "Paul Kovel, what on Earth are you doing out here?" "Nothing," I said, "I didn't hear the bell."</p><p begin="00:32:30.02" data-timestamp="1950.02">"Paul," she said, "now, listen to me. Paul, I need your help." "With what?"</p><p begin="00:32:35.18" data-timestamp="1955.18">I didn't think she looked angry, but her face was upside down and it was hard to tell. "With Timothy, Paul. I guess he's just very wound up right now. He's pretending he's a werewolf today. And even though that's fine and we all know how Timothy is sometimes, we have serious things to discuss with him, and we'd like him to stop pretending for just a little while."</p><p begin="00:32:55.69" data-timestamp="1975.69">"What if he isn't pretending?" I said. "What if he really is a werewolf?" "Maybe he is, Paul, but if you would just come inside and talk to him for a little bit, I think we might be able to persuade him to change back into Timothy. You're his friend, Paul. I asked him if he'd like to talk to you, and he said yes."</p><p begin="00:33:12.63" data-timestamp="1992.63">"I'm not his friend, Mrs. Gladfelter. I swear to god. I can't do anything."</p><p begin="00:33:17.25" data-timestamp="1997.25">"Paul, Timothy is in trouble. He needs your help, and I need your help, too. Now, if you come right this minute and get up out of that dirt, then I'll forget that you didn't come in from recess. If you don't come back inside, I'll have to speak to your mother."</p><p begin="00:33:32.49" data-timestamp="2012.49">She held out her hand. "Now, come on, Paul, please." And so I took her hand and let her pull me out of the ravine and across the deserted playground, aware that in doing so I was merely proving the unspoken corollary that my mother had left hanging the other morning in the air between her and Mrs. Stokes.</p><p begin="00:33:51.24" data-timestamp="2031.24">There was a song about me, too, I'm afraid, a popular little number that went "what's that smell-o, Paul Kovel-o, he's a big, fat, hippo Jell-O. He's a snoop. He smells like poop. He smells like tomato beef alphabet soup."</p><p begin="00:34:08.13" data-timestamp="2048.13">Timothy Stokes, I knew-- as I followed Mrs. Gladfelter down the long, silent hallway to the office, hating him more and more with each step-- was MY only friend. Timothy was sitting in a corner of the office, trapped in an orange vinyl armchair. There was a Roman numeral three scratched into his left cheek, and his brilliant white shirt and trousers were patterned with a camouflage of grass and dirt and asphalt.</p><p begin="00:34:40.88" data-timestamp="2080.88">"Well now, Timothy." Mrs. Gladfelter took me by the shoulders and maneuvered me around her. "Look who I found." "Hey, Timothy," I said. Timothy didn't look up.</p><p begin="00:34:53.45" data-timestamp="2093.45">Mrs. Gladfelter gave me a gentle push toward him in the small of my back. "Why don't you sit down, Paul." "No." I didn't want to be left alone with Timothy-- not because I was afraid of him, but because I was afraid that somebody would come into the office and see us sitting there, two matching rejects in matching orange chairs.</p><p begin="00:35:12.88" data-timestamp="2112.88">"That's enough now, Paul," said Mr. Buterbaugh, the principal, his friendly smile looking more false than usual. "Sit down." "It's all right," said Mrs. Gladfelter. "You see what you can do about helping Timothy turn back into Timothy. We're just going to give you a little privacy."</p><p begin="00:35:32.04" data-timestamp="2132.04">She followed Mr. Buterbaugh into his office and then poked her head back around the door. "I'm going to leave this door open in case you need us, all right?" There were three chairs next to Timothy's. I took the farthest and showed him my back, so that anyone passing by the windows of the office would not be able to conclude that he and I were engaged in any sort of conversation at all.</p><p begin="00:35:54.85" data-timestamp="2154.85">"Are you expelled?" I said. There was no reply. "Are you, Timothy?" Again he said nothing, and I couldn't stop myself from turning around to look at him. "Timothy, are you expelled?"</p><p begin="00:36:08.80" data-timestamp="2168.8">"I'm not Timothy, professor," said Timothy, gravely, but not without a certain air of satisfaction. "I'm afraid your precious antidote didn't work." "Come on, Timothy," I said. "cut it out. The moon's not even full today."</p><p begin="00:36:26.45" data-timestamp="2186.45">Now he turned toward me, "where were you," he said, "I was looking for you." "I was in the ditch." "With the ants?" I nodded. "I heard you talking to them before.</p><p begin="00:36:40.52" data-timestamp="2200.52">So, so are you Ant-Man?" "No, dummy." "Why not?" "Because I'm not anybody. You're not anybody either."</p><p begin="00:36:53.33" data-timestamp="2213.33">We fell silent for a while and just sat there, not looking at each other, kicking at the legs of our chairs. I could hear Mrs. Gladfelter and Mr. Buterbaugh talking softly in his office. Mr. Buterbaugh called her Elizabeth.</p><p begin="00:37:06.86" data-timestamp="2226.86">The telephone rang. A light flashed twice on the secretary's phone, then held steady. "Thanks for calling back, Dr. Schachter," I heard Mr. Buterbaugh say. "Yes, I'm afraid so."</p><p begin="00:37:20.72" data-timestamp="2240.72">I went to see Dr. Schachter a couple of times," I said. "He had Micronauts and the Fembots." "He has Stretch Armstrong, too," said Timothy. "I know." "Why did you go see him," Timothy said. "Did your mother make you?" "Yeah," I said.</p><p begin="00:37:39.36" data-timestamp="2259.36">"How come?" "I don't know. She said I was having problems with my anger. I don't know. I guess I was mad about my dad and things."</p><p begin="00:37:49.63" data-timestamp="2269.63">"He had to go to jail," Timothy said, "your dad." "Just for one night." "How come?" "He had too much to drink," I said. "Did you visit him in jail?" Timothy said.</p><p begin="00:38:03.72" data-timestamp="2283.72">"No, stupid. God! You belong in special school, Timothy. I hope they make you eat special food and wear a special helmet or something."</p><p begin="00:38:12.93" data-timestamp="2292.93">I heard the distant slam of the school's front door, and then a pair of hard shoes knocking along the hall. "Here comes your mother," I said. "What kind of special helmet?" said Timothy. "Ant-Man wears a helmet."</p><p begin="00:38:38.98" data-timestamp="2318.98">Mrs. Stokes entered the office. She was a tall, thin woman, much older than my mother, with long, gray hair and red, veiny hands. Every morning she made Timothy pancakes for his breakfast, which sounded OK until you found out that she put things in them like carrots and leftover pieces of corn.</p><p begin="00:38:59.32" data-timestamp="2339.32">"Oh, hello, Paul," she said in her Eeyore voice. "Mrs. Stokes," said Mrs. Gladfelter, coming out of the principal's office. "It's been kind of a long afternoon for Timothy, I'm afraid."</p><p begin="00:39:13.03" data-timestamp="2353.03">"How is Virginia?" said Mrs. Stokes. She still hadn't looked at Timothy. "Oh, she'll be fine, Mr. Buterbaugh said-- just a little shaken up. We sent her home early. Of course," he added, "her parents are going to want to speak to you." "Of course," said Mrs. Stokes. "I'm ready to do whatever you think would be best for Timothy."</p><p begin="00:39:34.80" data-timestamp="2374.8">"I'm not Timothy," said Timothy. "Oh, please, Timmy, stop this nonsense for once." "I'm cursed."</p><p begin="00:39:44.24" data-timestamp="2384.24">He leaned over and brought his face very close to mine. "Tell them about the curse, professor." I looked at Timothy, and for the first time I saw that a thin, dark down of wolfish hair had grown upon his cheek.</p><p begin="00:40:00.54" data-timestamp="2400.54">Then I looked at Mr. Buterbaugh and found that he was watching me with an air of earnest expectancy, as though he honestly thought there might be an eternal black magical curse on Timothy and was more than willing to listen to anything I might have to say on the subject. I shrugged. "Are you going to make him go to special school?" I said.</p><p begin="00:40:20.82" data-timestamp="2420.82">"All right, Paul, thank you," said Mrs. Gladfelter, "you may go back to class now." "See you later, Timothy," I said. He didn't answer me. He had started to growl again.</p><p begin="00:40:33.88" data-timestamp="2433.88">As I followed the secretary out of the office, I looked back and saw Mr. Buterbaugh and Mrs. Gladfelter and poor old Mrs. Stokes standing in a hopeless circle around Timothy. I thought for a second, and then I turned back toward them and raised an imaginary rifle to my shoulder.</p><p begin="00:40:55.33" data-timestamp="2455.33">"This is a dart gun," I announced. Everyone looked at me, but I was talking to Timothy now. I was almost, but not quite, embarrassed. "It's filled with darts of my special antidote, and I made it stronger than it used to be and it's going to work this time. And also, there's a tranquilizer mixed in."</p><p begin="00:41:18.60" data-timestamp="2478.6">Timothy looked up and bared his teeth at me, and I took aim right between his eyes. I jerked my hands twice and went fup, fup! Timothy's head snapped back and his eyelids fluttered.</p><p begin="00:41:34.36" data-timestamp="2494.36">He shook himself all over. He swallowed once. Then he held his hands out before him, as if wondering at their hairless pallor. "It seems to have worked," he said, his voice cool and reasonable and fine.</p><p begin="00:41:50.61" data-timestamp="2510.61">Anyone could see he was still playing his endless game, but all the grown ups, Mr. Buterbaugh in particular, looked very pleased with both of us. "Thank you very much, Paul," he said. "I'm not Paul," I said. Everybody laughed but Timothy Stokes."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:15.06" data-timestamp="2535.06"> An excerpt from Michael Chabon's short story "Werewolves in Their Youth," from the collection of short stories of the same name.

  <h3>Act Four: One Brain Shrinks, Another Brain Grows</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:33.33" data-timestamp="2553.33"> Act Four, One Brain Shrinks, One Brain Grows.</p><p begin="00:42:38.13" data-timestamp="2558.13">Back in 1999, Julie Hill's husband was diagnosed with a rare brain disease. And two years later, when her son Nick was just six years old, he began trying to make sense of what was happening to his dad. Julie gave us this dispatch back then on how her son was thinking about the whole thing at the time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Julie Hill</h4><p begin="00:42:54.90" data-timestamp="2574.9"> My son is mad at God and hates babies, and I blame <i>The</i> <i>Lion</i> <i>King.</i> I found out about Nick's feelings for babies about a year ago. We'd go to the park and he'd see a baby in a carriage and he'd say, "ew, a baby."</p><p begin="00:43:09.45" data-timestamp="2589.45">His school has mixed age classes, so there are kids aged three, four, five and six. This fall, our friend's three-year-old little boy named Chance joined Nick's class. We loved Chance and his family. We spend holidays with them.</p><p begin="00:43:23.17" data-timestamp="2603.17">But having Chance in the same class annoyed Nick. Nick taunted him, teasing Chance to tears, telling him, "Go back home, you're too little for school." Nick usually isn't mean like that. We couldn't figure it out.</p><p begin="00:43:36.96" data-timestamp="2616.96">Then one night at bedtime, Nick asked me, "mom, is Chance a baby?" I explained that Chance is much younger, but technically he wasn't a baby. Nick was quiet a while, and then he asked me if babies replace dying people.</p><p begin="00:43:54.19" data-timestamp="2634.19">Finally, I got it. You see, in <i>The</i> <i>Lion</i> <i>King,</i> the hero's father dies, and the big lesson of the film is that it's one big cycle. Some might die, but others are born. Some get to eat, and others are eaten. It's all part of the great, great circle of life.</p><p begin="00:44:10.57" data-timestamp="2650.57">So if you're a kid, you think if you could stop babies from being born, you'd stop people from dying-- you'd stop the circle. Nick thought if there were no babies, then maybe his dad wouldn't die. So to Nick, Chance was a threat to his dad's very existence.</p><p begin="00:44:32.00" data-timestamp="2672">If you ask my husband's college friends about him, they'll tell you Doug was a comedian. Not that he really ever made money at it. Doug was an advertising copywriter, actually, but dabbled in improv and stand-up and recorded humor. Back in the '80s when answering machines were new, we sold tapes of wacky outgoing messages.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Doug Hill</h4><p begin="00:44:50.10" data-timestamp="2690.1"> Hi. Sorry I can't come to the phone right now. I'm in the bathtub listening to my radio. So if you want to, just leave your message and your name at the tone.</p><p begin="00:44:58.64" data-timestamp="2698.64">[KNOCKING]</p><p begin="00:44:59.79" data-timestamp="2699.79">Oh, there's somebody at the door. Hey, whoops! Ah!</p><p begin="00:45:03.11" data-timestamp="2703.11">[BUZZING AND SPLASHING]</p><p begin="00:45:04.50" data-timestamp="2704.5">[SCREAMING]</p><p begin="00:45:06.36" data-timestamp="2706.36"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Julie Hill</h4><p begin="00:45:09.15" data-timestamp="2709.15"> OK, so that's not that funny. Still, I miss him so much. He was my best friend, and I'd take that stupid silliness any day. This is a recent voicemail from Doug.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Automated Voice</h4><p begin="00:45:22.74" data-timestamp="2722.74"> Sent Monday.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Doug Hill</h4><p begin="00:45:24.45" data-timestamp="2724.45"> Eric Clapton, Max somebody, Columbus, gir-- Columbus, girls up-- or whatever. OK. OK, bye.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Julie Hill</h4><p begin="00:45:40.86" data-timestamp="2740.86"> His brain's shrinking. My husband's brain is shrinking. The results of Doug's PET scan showed that he had frontal lobe dementia, a rare degenerative and ultimately fatal disease that slowly atrophies the brain. Its progression is similar to that of a baby's development, only backward.</p><p begin="00:46:02.30" data-timestamp="2762.3">The doctor said Doug, my 38-year-old husband who ran marathons and insisted on organic vegetables, had two to 10 years to live. During this time, he'd slowly, slowly lose his ability to work, drive, reason, feel emotions, count, go to the bathroom, walk, talk, swallow, and breathe.</p><p begin="00:46:28.50" data-timestamp="2788.5">Since then, Nick has tried to make logical sense of this mostly illogical disease, and he does this by looking for patterns to help sort it all out. These come up all the time. For instance, before he got sick, Doug drove most of the time. But as he got sicker, he could only sit in the passenger seat.</p><p begin="00:46:48.54" data-timestamp="2808.54">About six months after we took the car keys away from Doug, my friend Tim came in from San Francisco. Tim hopped into the passenger seat. Nick sat in the back in his booster. He stared at Tim sitting just in front of him and then asked, "Tim, do you have a brain disease?"</p><p begin="00:47:09.55" data-timestamp="2829.55">I'm not sure when it stopped making sense for Doug to live at home. Maybe it was the day he took a cab downtown and was missing until late that night. Maybe it was the day he went outside with nothing on but shaving cream. Or maybe it was the day he let a homeless person into our house. But at some point it was just too much-- especially too much for Nick to see.</p><p begin="00:47:29.08" data-timestamp="2849.08">Doug moved into long-term care in late March. After Doug moved, though, Nick's stress changed. Two weeks later, Nick came out of his bedroom crying. He missed his dad. He just wanted him to get better and to come home.</p><p begin="00:47:48.01" data-timestamp="2868.01">I had what I thought was a great idea-- to call Doug up. I wanted to prove his dad was alive, that contact was possible. We went through the rigmarole to get Doug on the phone.</p><p begin="00:47:59.00" data-timestamp="2879">"I love you, daddy," Nick said. "I love you," Doug repeated. "I miss you, daddy." "I miss you," Doug said.</p><p begin="00:48:07.18" data-timestamp="2887.18">Nick started to tell Doug about his day, how he played outside and how he skinned his knee. Then I heard the recording of the operator. "If you'd like to place a call, please hang up." Doug had hung up on Nick.</p><p begin="00:48:28.93" data-timestamp="2908.93">The way Nick makes sense of all this can catch me off-guard. His conclusions are perfectly logical. And sometimes the only way to address his fears is to use the same logic he does, with the same assumptions.</p><p begin="00:48:41.33" data-timestamp="2921.33">For example, last Mother's Day weekend, Nick and I had a session with Cory, his therapist. Mostly in these sessions I talk, and Cory helps me figure out appropriate responses to some of Nick's really big questions. But this time, Nick interrupted. He wanted to know what would happen to him if I died.</p><p begin="00:49:02.53" data-timestamp="2942.53">We gave the answer that clinically was supposed to satisfy him-- that I'm healthy, that I eat right, that I exercise, not to worry. And for a preschooler, that was supposed to do. But he called us on the carpet. "Daddy did all those things, too." Nick wasn't supposed to make that leap. The books say so.</p><p begin="00:49:25.03" data-timestamp="2965.03">And then he said, "Mommy, if you died, I'd be in the house all by myself. Who'd make dinner for me? How would I get to school?"</p><p begin="00:49:34.40" data-timestamp="2974.4">We explained that my parents would take care of him, and then he jumped to yet another level. "But it takes a long time to get to Chicago from Ohio where Grandma and Grandpa live. Who would take care of me until they got here?"</p><p begin="00:49:48.86" data-timestamp="2988.86">Nick is a planner. Having a plan seems to help him. So in a moment of inspiration, Cory took out a picture of Nick from my wallet. On it she wrote specific instructions that, in an emergency, call his babysitter Amber to take care of Nick while his grandparents drove from Ohio. Just having that little card in my wallet, that little plan, allowed him to let that fear go.</p><p begin="00:50:23.38" data-timestamp="3023.38">We don't know what caused Doug to get sick. It could be a toxin, it could be a long-forgotten head injury, it could be genetics. I try to pack that information away next to the Christmas ornaments, but one look at Nick and I get scared. Since no celebrity has this disease, there's very little money devoted for research, and so I'm doing this story for Nick. Not only so that people will understand this little life now, but maybe someone will take notice and start working on preventing this terrible disease before my kindergartner turns 30.</p><p begin="00:51:00.95" data-timestamp="3060.95">You might think it's all dark and dreary at our house. It's not. Actually, we're doing OK. This month, Nick graduated from kindergarten and he got his first bike without training wheels. And he's over his circle of life theory.</p><p begin="00:51:15.73" data-timestamp="3075.73">At night I stay in Nick's bed until he falls asleep. It's a bad habit his father formed right after he was diagnosed, like was trying to squeeze one last cuddle out of the day. Since I've taken over, it's become the time to talk about Doug, about everything. So for the past two weeks, I've brought a tape recorder into Nick's bed.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Julie Hill</h4><p begin="00:51:36.07" data-timestamp="3096.07"> Tell me about Daddy, when daddy had to move.

I said, "yes, I did." "Do you still cry about him?" I told him that I didn't, that right after someone dies, we tend to cry a lot, but after a while we stop crying and just feel lucky that we got to know and love that person so, so much.</p><p begin="00:52:52.99" data-timestamp="3172.99">Nick thought about that for a while, taking it all in. And then he said, "I know why you stopped crying. You decided that if you ever had a boy that you love so, so much that you'd name him Nick so you'd remember your grandpa, and that's why you stopped crying."</p><p begin="00:53:13.15" data-timestamp="3193.15">I think he's looking to me now for how to grieve, for what the next step is going to be. That it's OK to be sad and cry, and then it's OK when you finally stop crying, too.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nick Hill</h4><p begin="00:53:36.67" data-timestamp="3216.67"> Uh, I'm tired.
