  <h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.98" data-timestamp="0.98"> Hey there, everybody. Ira here. So if you heard our show last week, you know that I had just learned hours before we broadcast that episode that I needed to go into quarantine because a guy who I had shaken hands with five days before that developed symptoms and then tested positive for coronavirus. It is now 12 days since I shook hands with that guy, and I've not developed symptoms. CDC guidelines say that it can happen for up to 14 days, so I am nearly in the clear. A reminder to everybody that people who don't have symptoms can still be carrying the virus and give it to others. Anyway, the world has changed so much, right?</p><p begin="00:00:36.75" data-timestamp="36.75">One of the striking things about this coronavirus is how differently it affects different people. So some people who get it have no symptoms, or they get mild symptoms, or they experience something like a bad flu. That's particularly young and healthy people, though young, healthy adults are not immune. The CDC put out a report this week-- maybe you saw this-- saying 20% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients are between 20 and 44 years old.</p><p begin="00:01:01.80" data-timestamp="61.8">But it's older people, as we all know, who are living in a completely different world these days. If they leave their homes, they're walking around in a world that's suddenly filled with this invisible thing that can kill them with no idea of who around them might have it or what doorknob it might be on. One of our producers, David Kestenbaum, talked to this woman, Tova Rothman, who's 71. Her husband's 74 and has a compromised immune system, so he is in special danger if he comes into contact with the virus. Here's David.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:01:32.15" data-timestamp="92.15"> I talked to Tova last weekend, which feels like so long ago. I don't think I would do this now, but we met in person to talk. She lives in my town, in this apartment across from the pizza place, the little movie theater, the Kings supermarket. Her daughter told me she was eager to talk to someone.</p><p begin="00:01:48.74" data-timestamp="108.74">For her safety, I checked my temperature before I left the house, washed my hands twice, and wiped down my microphone, though even that is no guarantee. Again, I wouldn't do this now. She came down from her apartment carrying her cell phone and a canister of Clorox wipes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tova Rothman</h4><p begin="00:02:03.58" data-timestamp="123.58"> Oh, you brought your own wipes too.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:02:05.14" data-timestamp="125.14"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:02:05.60" data-timestamp="125.6"> We did the interview on a park bench. If she's a little off-mic sometimes, it's because I'm sitting as far away from her as possible, holding my arms straight out with the microphone. Every move she makes right now requires some impossible calculation. She has to avoid anything that might get her or her husband sick.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:02:21.68" data-timestamp="141.68"> How are you feeling in general?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tova Rothman</h4><p begin="00:02:25.91" data-timestamp="145.91"> Overwhelmed, but I feel like that I can master this. I went to Kings across the street. I just try to stay away from people. They have them restocking and restocking. And they actually have better fruit and fresher fruit now. [LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:02:47.78" data-timestamp="167.78">But you're not supposed to get between six feet of people. And millennials are all marching around buying things, and you're, whoa, don't come near me. I must look like I'm crazy, but that's the way it goes.</p><p begin="00:03:10.25" data-timestamp="190.25">This town is a very young town, and so there's a lot of young people and a lot of kids skateboarding. And they're in your face. And you're like, stay away. But they don't understand that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:03:23.78" data-timestamp="203.78"> Have you said anything to anybody?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tova Rothman</h4><p begin="00:03:26.87" data-timestamp="206.87"> No. Wearing my plastic gloves and carrying my canister of Clorox, I think they understand where I'm coming from. [LAUGHS] It sounds so funny.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:03:38.93" data-timestamp="218.93"> Her husband, because of his immune system, is stuck in the apartment.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tova Rothman</h4><p begin="00:03:42.74" data-timestamp="222.74"> My husband is not well. He can't go out, and he's not happy about it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:03:49.68" data-timestamp="229.68"> There's TV, of course, but annoyingly, no sports to watch because everything's been canceled. The other night, he had <i>Gunsmoke</i> on, which is really not Tova's thing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tova Rothman</h4><p begin="00:03:59.42" data-timestamp="239.42"> So we're not having a great relationship with this. I told him that I was checking on him, and he shouldn't get out of his chair. And he very nastily said, OK, I won't get out.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:04:14.87" data-timestamp="254.87"> Does he say, I want to go outside, and you say, we can't?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tova Rothman</h4><p begin="00:04:17.48" data-timestamp="257.48"> Yeah. He'll say, I want to do something. And I say, you can't. I would take him downstairs, and he could go out and get air in his face. But there's so many surfaces between our apartment and the lobby, and it's only one floor. But there's so much you have to worry about.</p><p begin="00:04:41.33" data-timestamp="281.33">It is a surreal thing. You just-- you think, what? Every morning, you wake up and think, I can't believe this. Is it real? So, it's real.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:05:01.50" data-timestamp="301.5"> Tova says her grandfather died from the Spanish flu in 1918.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tova Rothman</h4><p begin="00:05:07.28" data-timestamp="307.28"> He went to the opera. They used to get tickets where they could stand and pay a lot less. And so he went to the opera, and he was in a crowd. And he got-- he was sick one day and died the next.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:05:22.78" data-timestamp="322.78"> He was 26. I keep thinking about how differently everyone might view this thing, how different our country's response might have been if the virus were as dangerous for younger people.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tova Rothman</h4><p begin="00:05:33.14" data-timestamp="333.14"> Maybe we would have reacted faster because, oh, it's only the old people. [LAUGHS] That's how I feel. It wasn't quite as tragic if it's the old people. My friends keep calling and saying, who knew we were the old people, which is true.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:05:54.62" data-timestamp="354.62"> Tova stood up to go back to her husband. And as she did, this guy walked really close to her to throw a tissue in the trash can, as if it was two weeks ago or something. Tova was not happy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tova Rothman</h4><p begin="00:06:05.06" data-timestamp="365.06"> I was almost ready to throw my canister of wipes at him. He should stay away. Maybe I don't look 71. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:06:15.20" data-timestamp="375.2"> I'm sure that's it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tova Rothman</h4><p begin="00:06:15.96" data-timestamp="375.96"> Ah, yeah. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:06:18.34" data-timestamp="378.34"> OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tova Rothman</h4><p begin="00:06:18.81" data-timestamp="378.81"> Oh, very nice meeting you too.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:06:20.81" data-timestamp="380.81"> OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tova Rothman</h4><p begin="00:06:21.23" data-timestamp="381.23"> And thank you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:06:23.84" data-timestamp="383.84"> I called Tova four days later to see how she was doing. She's still going out for walks-- no supermarkets anymore.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:36.22" data-timestamp="396.22"> That was actually the very last interview that anybody on our staff did with somebody in person, David Kestenbaum's story. We have all been holed up in our own homes, everybody on the staff. We are one of the many businesses that have decided that it's safer for everybody if we're working from home. So everybody's doing interviews over the phone. We're all preparing stories for next week's show about what's happening in the country and in the world.</p><p begin="00:07:02.45" data-timestamp="422.45">But in the meantime, until then, thinking about what might be nice to hear on the radio in a moment like this one. I think so much of what is happening now, as we're being told to stay home, and so many of us are either cooped up with our families or reaching out to family members more than usual, and reaching out to the other people we love to see how they're doing, and to worry together about what's going to happen next, we thought, with that in mind, today we would prepare a show of stories that we've made over the years about families and about people trying to find comfort or find answers by turning to their families, including-- we have this one story from 25 years ago of me and my mom back when she was still alive. And I saw her quoted in a national magazine as a sexpert. I had some questions for her, and I called her. We get to that in Act Three.</p><p begin="00:07:55.77" data-timestamp="475.77">From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:10.69" data-timestamp="490.69"> Act One, "Hey, Dad. Dad!" So school was cut off in so many places, and kids are home. And we have this story of a parent trying to go about his day and his daughter coming to him over and over with some things on her mind. Stephanie Foo tells what happened.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:08:30.69" data-timestamp="510.69"> My friend Matt's older daughter went through one of those hardcore phases, where she got really into asking her dad a lot of questions. She was nine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:08:39.54" data-timestamp="519.54"> There's the why phase, and then the why phase can turn into the why not and explain, and that endless string of questions, like, why can't I have my own room? How do I get to school? Why can't we have a yard? Can I have a cookie? They're unrelenting.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:08:57.45" data-timestamp="537.45"> So one night, Matt was working from home, and Rosie was bugging him with her questions.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:09:02.25" data-timestamp="542.25"> And it was just sort of one after the other after the other. And I was like, all right, look, you got to just give me a minute. I'm working right now. Just go off and write them all down. Make me a list of the questions that you want me to answer, and I'll answer them for you.</p><p begin="00:09:18.60" data-timestamp="558.6">I thought it was going to be like three or four questions and then a picture of a rabbit or something. And I get this list, and I look at it. And these are the essential, unanswerable questions of life.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:09:34.37" data-timestamp="574.37"> Read a few of these questions for me. Start at the very top.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:09:37.95" data-timestamp="577.95"> OK. So, what is life? Why?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:09:40.76" data-timestamp="580.76"> That's the first question?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:09:41.59" data-timestamp="581.59"> That's the first question.

Do we become like God-- why? Why do you do what you do? How do you know what's true? Who do you miss-- why? Explain.</p><p begin="00:10:11.28" data-timestamp="611.28">Do you miss anyone more than them? And does that change, and how? And if that changes, was it worth missing them in the first place? And my favorite is-- pretty much just my jaw dropped-- why any of this? I mean, my first reaction to them is-- I mean, I'm proud of her. And then I realize I actually have to answer these questions.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:10:39.49" data-timestamp="639.49"> There are about three pages, single-spaced, of handwritten questions, about 50 questions total. But a promise was a promise, so Matt got to work. He's a professor at West Point, teaches writing. And so he took a professorial approach to it and started researching answers for her, looking up quotes on each topic, spending weeks, sometimes months, writing each answer.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:11:03.49" data-timestamp="663.49"> What's the shortest and what's the longest you've ever spent, and what's the hardest one?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:11:07.37" data-timestamp="667.37"> So I think the longest one is one that I haven't finished answering for her yet, which is, what is love?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:11:12.94" data-timestamp="672.94"> What's been the easiest one to answer so far?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:11:16.21" data-timestamp="676.21"> Is heaven another planet? No.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:11:24.91" data-timestamp="684.91"> I got him to read me one of the answers he worked hardest on. The answer to time-- why? Explain.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:11:31.03" data-timestamp="691.03"> Could you read it for me?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:11:32.75" data-timestamp="692.75"> Sure. So tell me what and tell me why, and the burden is on me to justify this to you. Perhaps that's what time means in the end, is justification or a lack of being justified. And I don't really know what justification means. There was an old movie I saw when I was a kid in your grandmother's house--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:11:50.36" data-timestamp="710.36"> He quotes Camus, then brings in the Millennium Falcon, then St. Augustine, then Kierkegaard. Rosie was nine. All his answers are like this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:12:00.00" data-timestamp="720"> Kierkegaard gets to this point after either/or'ing everything. He says, why did I not die as a baby?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:12:07.07" data-timestamp="727.07"> I'm a grown-up, and I find it impossible to follow your answers. Honestly, I have not any idea what you're saying.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:12:17.64" data-timestamp="737.64"> OK. [LAUGHS] Yeah. I mean, I really don't understand half of what I just said either, to be honest.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:12:27.01" data-timestamp="747.01"> What his answers do have going for them is sincerity. The time one ends like this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:12:32.41" data-timestamp="752.41"> In one of my favorite stories by a guy named William Faulkner, there's a daddy who gives his kid a watch and says, I give you this watch, not that you might remember time, but so that you might forget it for a little while. I can only tell you that time is me turning and turning while the world is turning around a star that turns around a center that turns around the whole time. Among all the other things, the little turning animals on all the little turning worlds, there is me, trying to turn to you.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:13:04.33" data-timestamp="784.33"> OK. And you just told her this answer like this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:13:09.21" data-timestamp="789.21"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:13:09.84" data-timestamp="789.84"> And she--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:13:11.37" data-timestamp="791.37"> I mean, she would kind of pass in and out of being interested in it. And at the end of it she's just kind of like, oh, yeah, OK. And I'm like, all right, well.</p><p begin="00:13:25.20" data-timestamp="805.2">I mean, do you see what I'm saying about time? It's a measurement of change. It's an arbitrary human construct, but not, but it feels different, so it's phenomena. She's like, yeah, yeah, OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie</h4><p begin="00:13:37.31" data-timestamp="817.31"> I was like, oh, well, this isn't really exactly what I wanted.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:13:41.10" data-timestamp="821.1"> That's not what you wanted because you were like, oh, this is kind of boring?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie</h4><p begin="00:13:44.23" data-timestamp="824.23"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:13:45.41" data-timestamp="825.41"> Rosie has a pixie cut and a cheeky grin. She gave her dad the 50 questions three years ago. She's 12 now. He's been working on getting her answers, but he's only gone through 2/3 of them because it takes him so long to cobble together a response. What I found out talking to Rosie is she didn't even really care about the answers to these questions.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie</h4><p begin="00:14:05.66" data-timestamp="845.66"> Questions that I thought that would take him a long time to answer, because at the time I really just wanted to talk to him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:14:12.52" data-timestamp="852.52"> It all started when she first moved to New York City. Before then, she'd been living with her mom and grandparents most of the week. But then her grandpa, who she was really close to, died, and she had to move in with her dad during the week instead. At the same time, she started at a new school where the kids either ignored or bullied her, and she felt lost. One day, she came home from school and decided she needed to do something about it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie</h4><p begin="00:14:35.47" data-timestamp="875.47"> I was lonely, and I felt a little sad that nobody had really stepped out to say, oh, hey, it's going to be OK. I'll be your friend. So that's when I really, really needed somebody to talk to.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:14:52.66" data-timestamp="892.66"> So you didn't have anybody to talk to at school?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie</h4><p begin="00:14:55.03" data-timestamp="895.03"> No.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:14:55.81" data-timestamp="895.81"> And then at home?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie</h4><p begin="00:14:57.60" data-timestamp="897.6"> No. That's really why I felt like, oh, this is my dad. He's a really important person. I love him very much. I really want to become closer with him. I wish there was something that I could do to make us closer.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:15:10.81" data-timestamp="910.81"> Did you feel like your dad wasn't paying enough attention to you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie</h4><p begin="00:15:13.73" data-timestamp="913.73"> Yeah, a little bit. Or not a little bit, yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:15:18.28" data-timestamp="918.28"> What was he doing instead?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie</h4><p begin="00:15:20.86" data-timestamp="920.86"> He was writing papers on his computer. And I knew, at the time, how important it was, but part of me still wished that, like, put down all the screens, put down everything else, and just talk. So I wrote all the questions down, and they were big questions because I know my dad. And if it's a little question, he'll elaborate on it, and he'll make it a big deal. So if you times that by a big complex question, that would be a huge talk.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:15:59.45" data-timestamp="959.45"> Is it true that you weren't talking to her much at the time?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:16:02.33" data-timestamp="962.33"> No, I think I was talking to her all the time. I would tell her it's time to get up and go to school. I would tell her that it was time to do her homework. I would tell her that she needed a new jacket. Yeah, I mean, I talked to you all the time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:16:17.45" data-timestamp="977.45"> Maybe you're noticing the purely logistical nature of everything he mentioned. It certainly didn't get past Rosie.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:16:22.75" data-timestamp="982.75"> I talked to you all the time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie</h4><p begin="00:16:24.02" data-timestamp="984.02"> Yeah, but to me, it's not really the same thing. So conversation and talking are completely different things. Talking could be a range from, oh, hey, what's up? And conversation is you're deep in thought, and you're looking, and you're making eye contact, and you're really enjoying the presence of somebody else.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:16:48.17" data-timestamp="1008.17"> Rosie's a smart kid, yeah, but this is the thing I really admire about her. Matt was a single dad with two kids, going to school and trying to make the rent at the same time. Telling him to pay attention to her didn't cut it, so she figured out something else. I read this short story recently about a successful con man whose motto was, make them want to give you the thing you want to take. Rosie made her dad want to give her attention by making an opportunity to do what he loved, ponder over life's big questions.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie</h4><p begin="00:17:21.15" data-timestamp="1041.15"> My dad was kind of hard-shelled, I guess. And so it took a lot. I had to keep asking these questions and keep wondering. For me, it was just-- I had to keep going, and keep trying, and keep being this little bird that goes on your shoulders, like, I'm now your friend.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:17:39.24" data-timestamp="1059.24"> Do you feel like it sort of taught him how to talk to you better?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie</h4><p begin="00:17:43.44" data-timestamp="1063.44"> Yeah, definitely. Over the past three years, we've really worked on having actual conversations than him just answering questions for me because we practice it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:18:00.74" data-timestamp="1080.74"> Rosie never knew that her dad spent months and months writing down each answer. Matt only told her when I started working on this story. And she said she felt like, what? Are you kidding me?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie</h4><p begin="00:18:12.12" data-timestamp="1092.12"> I had no idea that he was doing all these things, and it was just a big surprise for me. If I could, I would definitely just say forget the questions. I just want to talk.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:18:23.50" data-timestamp="1103.5"> So you're like, well, you don't even have to go through all that trouble.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie</h4><p begin="00:18:26.92" data-timestamp="1106.92"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:18:27.79" data-timestamp="1107.79"> Just hang out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie</h4><p begin="00:18:28.63" data-timestamp="1108.63"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:18:30.27" data-timestamp="1110.27"> Rosie said this to her dad when she found out, and it really threw him for a loop.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:18:34.35" data-timestamp="1114.35"> Yeah, it was a complete waste of time. [LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:18:36.77" data-timestamp="1116.77"></p><p begin="00:18:37.75" data-timestamp="1117.75">I mean, what a complete waste of time to come up with these big, extensive projects that-- they were definitely less important to them than just listening to them.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:18:49.73" data-timestamp="1129.73"> Hm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:18:51.48" data-timestamp="1131.48"> What is time-- why? Explain. Well, I can tell you what I don't want time to be. I don't want time to be something where I am just figuring out that I need to shut up and make some time to listen to this little kid before it's too late.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:19:13.77" data-timestamp="1153.77"> Rosie really started asking the questions because she wanted to know that she wasn't alone and that everything was going to be OK. Now she enjoys hearing the answers because they remind her that that's true. That's why one of her favorite answers is the ending of time-- why? Explain-- the part about all of the planets turning around themselves and in the middle of it Matt turning towards Rosie.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie</h4><p begin="00:19:35.16" data-timestamp="1175.16"> One of the meanings of that is even though everything is happening around you, he just wants to know about me a little more, I guess. And a thing that I really like about that is because he just uses these sentences that make me happy when I read them.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:19:56.11" data-timestamp="1196.11"> It's kind of funny. When he read this to me, he sort of choked up a little bit.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie</h4><p begin="00:20:00.36" data-timestamp="1200.36"> Yeah. He likes to be kind of a one-expression person, but when he reads stuff like this he gets all emotional. In the car ride here, he was like, oh, I love you so much. And he was tearing up and looking out the window, so.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:20:18.96" data-timestamp="1218.96"> [LAUGHS] You look so happy about that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie</h4><p begin="00:20:23.31" data-timestamp="1223.31"> Yeah, it's pretty great.</p><p begin="00:20:25.16" data-timestamp="1225.16">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:20:26.64" data-timestamp="1226.64"></p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:20:34.57" data-timestamp="1234.57"> So people have been asking these big, important questions like, why are we here? What is life-- forever? And do you think that the real big reason why we ask it is to have a reason to talk to each other?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie</h4><p begin="00:20:51.40" data-timestamp="1251.4"> No. I think that philosophers actually really do wonder about these things, and they don't use it so that they can talk to their dads more. They use it because they really wonder about these things, and they want to know everything about it. But for my personal use, yes. That's exactly it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:21:09.01" data-timestamp="1269.01"> Matt does still want to keep answering Rosie's questions for her, but as for the hardest question, what is love, I don't think Rosie needs her dad to explain that to her anymore. She gets it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:21:28.01" data-timestamp="1288.01"> Stephanie Foo. She's currently writing a book about complex PTSD.

So many of us are concerned right now about our older relatives, especially our parents and grandparents. And this story, in the most literal way, is about reaching out over the phone.

I'm going to want to hear her voice when she's gone, though somehow I didn't extend that thought to I could hear her voice right now if I picked up the phone. She had a talent for the form. With some of them, it almost feels like I'm talking to her, except she's playing both parts.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean's Mom</h4><p begin="00:22:47.00" data-timestamp="1367"> What time is it?

It was relatively sudden and totally unexpected. And as much as I thought I was preparing myself for that moment, I wasn't prepared. It's true I didn't call enough, but she was still the first person I thought to call when something huge happened, good or bad.</p><p begin="00:24:40.22" data-timestamp="1480.22">I loved talking to her. She was funny, as you can tell, and smart. She wrote technical manuals in the early days of personal computing. Later in life, she lugged a lot of pro-grade camera equipment around the world, taking pictures. And yet, she had a hard time figuring out her smartphone.

He and I never really had a phone relationship when my mother was alive. It was more the classic thing of, you want to say hi to Ed? And then we'd verbally clap each other on the back and then back to Mom. These days, it's not weird for us to spend almost two hours on the phone together.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:25:37.60" data-timestamp="1537.6"> Then I had to give tweets out, so--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:25:40.09" data-timestamp="1540.09"> You are the most active octogenarian on Twitter that I know about.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:25:44.39" data-timestamp="1544.39"> Well, I try to send out about six or seven tweets.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:25:47.30" data-timestamp="1547.3"> What did you send this morning?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:25:49.27" data-timestamp="1549.27"> Oh, I sent about three or four from--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:25:51.38" data-timestamp="1551.38"> I think of how annoyed my mom would be if she knew this, but I'm now performing the exact telephone behavior she wanted from me when she was around, except now with Ed. I call about once a week on average, and it's always me initiating the calls now. At first, of course, it was mainly to make sure he was holding up OK and to make sure I was holding up OK.</p><p begin="00:26:13.13" data-timestamp="1573.13">But even now, when I miss a week, it eats at me. I'm thinking, got to call Ed, got to call Ed. It's like an injustice that he's getting this treatment and not her, and I keep trying to square it somehow. But when I put this to Ed, he basically said it's really not that big a mystery.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:26:30.47" data-timestamp="1590.47"> Kind of obvious that if one parent dies, you realize that the other one may not be that far off, that he will go too, or she. So the scarcity, just like in economics, makes the value go up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:26:48.40" data-timestamp="1608.4"> I never thought of this in economic terms before.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:26:50.90" data-timestamp="1610.9"> Well, it's true of many things.

He taught philosophy and logic at a university in Boston for a lot of years, which is fitting because Ed is very logical and philosophical. He's always quoting one or another great thinker. For fun, he does math. He and my mom got together when I was six. He moved in when I was 11.</p><p begin="00:27:14.27" data-timestamp="1634.27">And I think he's right that I call because I'm more aware than ever that one day he won't be on the other end of the phone, but it's more than that too. Even though we have all of these other people in our family whom we love, it got to feeling like Ed's the other one Mom's death happened to, like he and I were the ones who mutually needed to talk about Mom and to hear about her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:27:36.68" data-timestamp="1656.68"> I feel that, yes, I can talk to you about Pat because you're willing to talk to her about it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:27:44.48" data-timestamp="1664.48"> To you about it, yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:27:45.88" data-timestamp="1665.88"> And it makes a big difference to me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:27:47.93" data-timestamp="1667.93"> It does?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:27:48.92" data-timestamp="1668.92"> Of course.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:27:49.67" data-timestamp="1669.67"> I'm so glad to hear that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:27:51.65" data-timestamp="1671.65"> Because you lost the same person, even if it's somewhat similar if somebody else has lost someone else, like these groups in which everyone has lost a spouse.

OK, here we go.</p><p begin="00:32:37.45" data-timestamp="1957.45">Our parents can surprise us with what they don't tell us, with what they don't talk about, especially when it comes to sex. Recently I had this experience. An ex-girlfriend was in the gym, looking through a copy of <i>Marie</i> <i>Claire</i> magazine, women's magazine.

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:40:38.70" data-timestamp="2438.7"> It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass, speaking to you today not from a studio, but from home because our staff is working from home. And also, I am on quarantine. I'm actually talking to you from inside a closet. It's an old recording trick, with the idea that the clothes absorb sound. I will just say, it's very cramped.</p><p begin="00:40:56.76" data-timestamp="2456.76">Today on our program, with kids out of school all over the country and businesses closed, and people hunkered down at home with family, and also lots of people far from family and the ones they love, reaching out and worried for them, we have put together a show of family stories that we've made over the years. Both the stories in this next part of our show are people turning to their dads over the telephone with a question. This first one, Act Four, "It Takes a Villa," comes from Neil Drumming.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:41:23.04" data-timestamp="2483.04"> In the summer of 1982, my dad did something unexpected, something that seemed unbelievably indulgent. He took me, my mom, my brother, and the youngest of my three sisters on the most epic road trip any of us could have possibly imagined at the time. We piled into my dad's Buick Skylark and drove from Queens, New York to the World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee, where a robot danced for us, and then down into Orlando, Florida.</p><p begin="00:41:49.35" data-timestamp="2509.35">This was a big deal. Before this, going away meant visiting relatives in South Carolina and sitting uncomfortably among aunts and second cousins whose names I would forget before we'd even pulled out of their dusty driveways. This trip was not country heat and sipping sugar water on some rickety porch while listening to the inscrutable conversation of grown folk. It was what going 1,000 miles from home should feel like.</p><p begin="00:42:13.83" data-timestamp="2533.83">We cruised down a brightly-lit street called International Drive. We stayed at a Holiday Inn taller and more grand than any I'd ever seen. Sunlight streamed in through a hole in the ceiling, a hole that was supposed to be there.</p><p begin="00:42:27.40" data-timestamp="2547.4">Our parents took us to a building that looked like a pile of poached eggs, but was actually Xanadu, House of the Future. And everywhere, along every roadside, billboards promised that the most magical scene still awaited us, this place, Disney World. By all accounts, it was paradise for kids. But between the gas, and the hotels, and the eating out, my dad quickly discovered how expensive taking even 60% of his brood on a Disney vacation could be. He was resigned to do it, but he wasn't above working the angles.</p><p begin="00:43:02.22" data-timestamp="2582.22">He found out that you could get cheap tickets to the Magic Kingdom if you just signed up to sit through an hour or so spiel from someone pitching timeshares. He was in. The hard sell went down at the Disney Village, a branded mini mall near the famous theme park. My mom, dad, and a handful of other determined parents stowed their kids in a room full of toys that had been conveniently provided by the salespeople. The parents set about the business of listening, or not, waiting patiently for the moment when the closers would stop shilling and start handing out the Disney discounts.</p><p begin="00:43:37.99" data-timestamp="2617.99">But while we kids were in another room throwing LEGOs at one another, something surprising happened. My dad bit. He went into a closed room to get three-day passes just so that I could eventually lose my glasses on Space Mountain, and he came out with a deed, the deed to something he and my mom were now calling our villa.</p><p begin="00:44:00.50" data-timestamp="2640.5">My father was a bold man, but in retrospect this is the most impetuous action that I have ever seen him take. It cost him about $5,000, which he paid in installments. In 1982, for a guy with five kids, who never made more than $33,000 a year at his day job, it was a considerable investment.</p><p begin="00:44:20.87" data-timestamp="2660.87">For those unfamiliar with timeshares, it may be hard to wrap your head around buying a vacation home that you never really own. You pay upfront for it. There's an annual maintenance fee, but you only get to stay in it once a year or so, usually for a week at a time. It almost sounds like some sort of scam, and sometimes it is. But it didn't turn out that way for us. Instead, it became a fixture in my family.</p><p begin="00:44:46.07" data-timestamp="2686.07">My father had chosen, as our week, the first week in July. And so every year, during one of the hottest months of the year, we would head down I-95 as always. But now when we pulled into South Carolina to see relatives, that was only a pit stop on the way to our true destination. We had transformed from people who went away to a family who went on vacation.</p><p begin="00:45:16.07" data-timestamp="2716.07">Our villa was number 317, a two-bedroom apartment with an enclosed back porch that looked out onto a small man-made lake complete with fish, ducks, and another summer word that I learned, "gazebo." My brother chased cicadas and lizards. For my sister, the only swimmer among my siblings, there was a pool. There were tennis courts and bikes to rent. The general store even offered a collection of the latest movies on laser disk.</p><p begin="00:45:42.14" data-timestamp="2742.14">That first trip, I was eight. As I got older, I moved from the gazebo to the game room and then the gym, trying to meet other kids my age. My mom busied herself in the kitchen, making lunches, or sat by the lake and watched the ducks. My dad shepherded us through It's a Small World and Epcot Center.</p><p begin="00:45:59.72" data-timestamp="2759.72">Our summers went on like this, pretty much exactly like this, probably until I finished high school. I honestly loved it. I looked forward to this trip every year. And even though it was only a week, it was almost always the highlight of my entire summer.</p><p begin="00:46:15.95" data-timestamp="2775.95">But when I think about it now, it occurs to me my dad pretty much orchestrated this thing that became so important to our lives, and I have no idea whether or not he ever enjoyed it himself. In fact, it didn't seem like he did. I can't recall actually seeing him happy.</p><p begin="00:46:31.84" data-timestamp="2791.84">Neither does my brother. He says Dad was pretty much the same at the timeshare as he was at home. Sometimes he'd go for walks alone, but often he just sat on the couch and watched TV. I asked my sister. She said he must have been happy, but she doesn't remember witnessing it either. It seems like such a simple question, but I just wanted to know, did he enjoy himself?</p><p begin="00:47:00.35" data-timestamp="2820.35">At the risk of embodying the most tired trope in all of modern masculinity, I will say my father and I never really got along. He was strict, his house had a lot of rules, and he believed in corporal punishment. And the sting of that conflict stayed with me as an adult. But since my mom passed away last year, I've been trying to connect with him more. I gave him a call.</p><p begin="00:47:21.55" data-timestamp="2841.55">[DIAL TONE]</p><p begin="00:47:23.87" data-timestamp="2843.87"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neil's Dad</h4><p begin="00:47:25.73" data-timestamp="2845.73"> Hello?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:47:26.66" data-timestamp="2846.66"> Hello?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neil's Dad</h4><p begin="00:47:27.75" data-timestamp="2847.75"> Yes?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:47:28.50" data-timestamp="2848.5"> Hey, it's Neil.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neil's Dad</h4><p begin="00:47:29.58" data-timestamp="2849.58"> Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:47:30.63" data-timestamp="2850.63"> Is it a bad time?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neil's Dad</h4><p begin="00:47:31.80" data-timestamp="2851.8"> It's about who?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:47:33.02" data-timestamp="2853.02"> I said, is it a bad time?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neil's Dad</h4><p begin="00:47:34.60" data-timestamp="2854.6"> No, no.

He says he only finished high school because by the time he was old enough, he was the one driving the bus. Sometimes when there were athletic events at other schools, he'd get to drive the teams and learn what the nearby towns were like.</p><p begin="00:48:50.48" data-timestamp="2930.48">In 1953, he was drafted into the Army, which had only recently been integrated. They sent him to Colorado and Indiana, and it wasn't great. He says the Army was really not into black people back then. So those were his travel experiences when he was young. I was hearing a lot of this for the first time, and as it turns out, that's at least partially my own fault.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neil's Dad</h4><p begin="00:49:12.34" data-timestamp="2952.34"> The reason why we never talk about it, because it just wasn't the kind of thing that you guys seemed to be interested in.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:49:20.53" data-timestamp="2960.53"> Really? So we just didn't seem like we were interested as kids?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neil's Dad</h4><p begin="00:49:24.85" data-timestamp="2964.85"> Yeah, right.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:49:26.21" data-timestamp="2966.21"> Yeah, I probably wasn't so interested back then, back when the two of us were constantly challenging each other. I was always either afraid of him or angry at him, hiding from him, or planting my feet to confront him. It never crossed my mind to try to understand him. But nowadays, my dad feels to me like some kind of living cold case, a million-page brief that is no longer redacted. Maybe it's because I'm now at the age he was when I was born, but I retroactively find his every decision fascinating, even the ones that aren't so surprising on the surface.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:49:59.68" data-timestamp="2999.68"> Why Florida?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neil's Dad</h4><p begin="00:50:02.24" data-timestamp="3002.24"> It was advertising. You get to hear something about Florida and then this thing, Disney World. After we started going, they built Epcot. They built Animal Kingdom.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:50:20.17" data-timestamp="3020.17"> Mhm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neil's Dad</h4><p begin="00:50:20.77" data-timestamp="3020.77"> And they advertise them a lot.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:50:22.82" data-timestamp="3022.82"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neil's Dad</h4><p begin="00:50:23.47" data-timestamp="3023.47"> Not many people were going. We were probably the most vacationing people in our area.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:50:31.33" data-timestamp="3031.33"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neil's Dad</h4><p begin="00:50:31.93" data-timestamp="3031.93"> I don't know of any other family that went on vacation every year. We did.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:50:38.08" data-timestamp="3038.08"> My dad was obviously proud that he'd gotten the timeshare, but pride, strictly speaking, does not constitute joy. It didn't answer the question of whether or not he was actually happy spending those summer weeks with us at the villa. Instead, he kept trying to make me understand why he brought us there in the first place. And his explanation, his reasoning reach back to memories and past experiences that not only had I never heard, but that kind of blew my mind.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neil's Dad</h4><p begin="00:51:05.93" data-timestamp="3065.93"> I tell you, probably where I got the whole idea-- when we were in school, every summer you had to try to think of something that you could write about when you'd go back to school, because you're going to have to write something about what you did this summer. Well, we never had anything to write about when I was going to school. And you didn't think plowing a mule, or picking peaches, or stuff that you had to normally do-- you didn't think that was so exciting to write about.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:51:45.09" data-timestamp="3105.09"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neil's Dad</h4><p begin="00:51:48.01" data-timestamp="3108.01"> So we made up lies about what we did. Well, every summer you guys went on vacation, you could write about something that you did, or saw, or someplace you went.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:52:04.71" data-timestamp="3124.71"> Yeah. What did you do during the summers?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neil's Dad</h4><p begin="00:52:10.22" data-timestamp="3130.22"> When, this year?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:52:12.11" data-timestamp="3132.11"> No, no, when you were in school.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neil's Dad</h4><p begin="00:52:14.84" data-timestamp="3134.84"> [LAUGHS] Worked.</p><p begin="00:52:16.52" data-timestamp="3136.52">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:52:18.32" data-timestamp="3138.32"></p><p begin="00:52:19.87" data-timestamp="3139.87">That's what I tried to tell you.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:52:22.41" data-timestamp="3142.41"> [LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:52:23.35" data-timestamp="3143.35"></p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:52:29.49" data-timestamp="3149.49"> We talked for over an hour. It was one of the longest conversations that I can remember us ever having. Every now and then, I'd try to steer him back to the question I wanted him to answer.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:52:39.54" data-timestamp="3159.54"> So I know I asked you this a bunch of times. I keep asking you the same question. You can tell me to stop asking you if you want, but did you have fun yourself?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neil's Dad</h4><p begin="00:52:49.26" data-timestamp="3169.26"> Yeah. See, I don't regret anything because it looked to me like I was doing what I was supposed to do. And to see you kids happy was to be happy too. And you guys could always come in and do whatever it is, and go back out to the pool or whatever.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:53:12.27" data-timestamp="3192.27"> Mhm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neil's Dad</h4><p begin="00:53:13.06" data-timestamp="3193.06"> I remember you guys playing out there and hanging around the bushes and stuff.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:53:19.65" data-timestamp="3199.65"> [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neil's Dad</h4><p begin="00:53:21.09" data-timestamp="3201.09"> I thought it was great.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:53:23.16" data-timestamp="3203.16"> That's a kind of enjoyment I hadn't considered. I live more selfishly. Also, his answer was hard to take in, to reconcile with the distance I felt between us at the time, back when he would retire to the couch to watch TV or we went off to play on our own. Maybe he was watching me play in the bushes and getting a kick out of it, but I didn't know that. Still, I was happy at the villa, and my dad says he was too. I'm glad I know that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:53:53.33" data-timestamp="3233.33"> All right. So I have been talking to you for an hour. I should probably let you go. But hey, is it OK if I call back this week and just talk? I want to hear more stuff since I didn't seem interested when I was a kid. I didn't realize that was why you didn't tell us stuff. So now I'll just ask. Is that OK if I could--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neil's Dad</h4><p begin="00:54:11.89" data-timestamp="3251.89"> The only thing I'd do is get up, and sometimes I'm outside just walking around.

  <h3>Act Five: Let’s Talk Radio</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:50.63" data-timestamp="3290.63"> Act Five, "Let's Talk Radio."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:54:53.43" data-timestamp="3293.43"> We'd like to ask you this question, my friend. Do personal problems and worries have you down? Are you disturbed by business problems, marriage problems, or emotional problems? See Mrs. K, reader and advisor. Mrs. K, formerly of Europe, gives you a reading and answers all your questions for just $1.00. And you'll feel much better.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:12.96" data-timestamp="3312.96"> OK. So this is my father in 1956, three years before I was born. He's 23 years old in this recording. And it's amazing, to me, anyway, hearing him so young, doing something I know so well, trying to sound like you're just talking, totally relaxed, when, in fact, you're reading.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira's Dad</h4><p begin="00:55:30.79" data-timestamp="3330.79"> And coming up right now, news about a wonderful appliance from Norman R. Mitchell just for the homemakers, as we said before. We're talking about an electric dryer. And, my friend--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:43.47" data-timestamp="3343.47"> My father started in radio when he was 19, the same age I was when I started. He began at the college station at the University of Maryland, then after graduation he got a job spinning records at a commercial station in Baltimore. He loved it. He continued doing this on Sunday mornings while he was in the Army, stationed in Virginia. That's where this recording is from.</p><p begin="00:56:02.74" data-timestamp="3362.74">And at some point my mom got pregnant a second time with me, and he decided to quit radio. It just didn't pay enough. The most he ever made at a radio job was $90 a week, which wasn't much money even then. And at that point he became the person that I knew him as, a certified public accountant. Years ago, I called him for a story for our show to ask about that decision to leave radio, and it was interesting. There was no sentimentality at all, like nothing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira's Dad</h4><p begin="00:56:35.84" data-timestamp="3395.84"> By that time, I had realized that radio was not for me. What happened would be a new program director would come in, and if you weren't the apple of that guy's eye then you were out of a job. You got to go start looking for a job again. Even though that never happened to me, I could see it happening to other people. And I wanted to be in control of my own destiny, and I decided that it wasn't going to work out. Radio was not going to work out.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:00.59" data-timestamp="3420.59"> And that was 1959?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira's Dad</h4><p begin="00:57:01.70" data-timestamp="3421.7"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:02.37" data-timestamp="3422.37"> The year I was born.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira's Dad</h4><p begin="00:57:03.32" data-timestamp="3423.32"> Right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:04.64" data-timestamp="3424.64"> Are those two things related?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira's Dad</h4><p begin="00:57:06.31" data-timestamp="3426.31"> Not at all. [LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:57:08.57" data-timestamp="3428.57"></p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:09.44" data-timestamp="3429.44"> It sounds like they are.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira's Dad</h4><p begin="00:57:10.78" data-timestamp="3430.78"> No, they're not. No, they're not.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:13.00" data-timestamp="3433"> I don't know if he wants to take me out of the equation, so I don't feel bad for him quitting radio, but I don't believe him. I do believe that, even in his private moments, today he doesn't regret the decision. His hearing is so bad these days, even with hearing aids, I doubt that he'll hear this story on the radio or online.</p><p begin="00:57:34.57" data-timestamp="3454.57">I talked to him a couple times this week. He turns 87 on Monday, so part of the population in greatest danger right now. He said he and my stepmom aren't going out. They just figured out how to get groceries delivered. And I'm worried for them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira's Dad</h4><p begin="00:57:51.26" data-timestamp="3471.26"> Well, all the stars are on record, and all the records star on the Sunday morning carousel.
