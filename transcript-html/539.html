  <h3>Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.97" data-timestamp="0.97">Now, a man who took a leap into the unknown, back in 1947. He was a New York City bus driver named William Cimillo. For a while, he became the most famous bus driver in the country. Though, I think what that really means is that he was the only famous bus driver in the country. He told his story on television.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Announcer</h4><p begin="00:00:16.30" data-timestamp="16.3">Pepsi-Cola presents Faye Emerson.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Faye Emerson</h4><p begin="00:00:20.47" data-timestamp="20.47">Hello again. Do you ever think of getting away from it all? A bus driver had that same feeling. And he made every headline in the country. So I asked him to come up here and tell us all about it. Hello, Bill.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>William Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:00:32.64" data-timestamp="32.64">Pleasure to meet you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Faye Emerson</h4><p begin="00:00:33.64" data-timestamp="33.64">Thank you. Come on. Sit down, and let's talk. Hey, Charlie, you got a couple of Pepsis here for us?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charlie</h4><p begin="00:00:37.65" data-timestamp="37.65">Pepsis right here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Faye Emerson</h4><p begin="00:00:38.70" data-timestamp="38.7">Thanks, Charlie.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charlie</h4><p begin="00:00:39.53" data-timestamp="39.53">Yes, ma'am.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:40.37" data-timestamp="40.37">OK. So I just want to describe what's happening here. It's black and white. The set of this TV show is a living room, but like a complete living room with everything. Window blinds, paintings on the walls, there's a credenza.</p><p begin="00:00:51.56" data-timestamp="51.56">This was back before TV figured out that the only part of the living room that they actually need for a talk show is the couch. So OK. A butler-- yes, a butler-- hands the host, Faye Emerson, a silver tray with a bottle of Pepsi and two glasses. Faye pours her guest a soda and--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Faye Emerson</h4><p begin="00:01:07.55" data-timestamp="67.55">Will you tell us what happened, please?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>William Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:01:08.93" data-timestamp="68.93">I don't [INAUDIBLE].</p><p begin="00:01:09.85" data-timestamp="69.85">[GLASSES CLINKING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Faye Emerson</h4><p begin="00:01:10.31" data-timestamp="70.31">Wonderful.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>William Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:01:13.07" data-timestamp="73.07">Well, it's one of those things. I was on the job for about 20 years, and I really got tired of it all, you know. Up and down, every day, the same people, the same stops, nickels, dimes, transfers, and-- well, this morning, I thought I'd try something different. So I come out of my garage. Instead of making a right turn to go off to my route, I thought I'd make a left turn.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Faye Emerson</h4><p begin="00:01:34.66" data-timestamp="94.66">And that was the first thought you'd really given to it. Just, you did it on impulse.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>William Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:01:37.30" data-timestamp="97.3">That's right. So I made this left turn, and I went west towards George Washington Bridge. It was a beautiful morning. The sun was shining. So I got on the other side of the Washington Bridge-- I was in Jersey then-- and I stopped for breakfast.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:54.41" data-timestamp="114.41">After breakfast, Cimillo got back in his bus, and he didn't drive to the Bronx to pick up his passengers on his usual route. He headed south on US Route 1. Cimillo had been a bus driver with what was then called the Surface Transportation System of New York for 17 years, without any problems.</p><p begin="00:02:10.83" data-timestamp="130.83">Went to work every day, never complained, people said. As he drove further and further away from New York City, and from his job, and from his, you know, life, he switched the destination sign from Subway to Special. Hours passed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>William Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:02:30.12" data-timestamp="150.12">I kept riding. Before I knew it, I was in Washington. And I was right in front of the White House.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Faye Emerson</h4><p begin="00:02:36.23" data-timestamp="156.23">You ever been to Washington before?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>William Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:02:37.11" data-timestamp="157.11">Never been there. Never. So I decided to look around. I looked around for 15, 20 minutes. When I come back, there's a policeman standing by the bus. And he asked me, he says, what are you doing here with this great big bus in a restricted parking area?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Faye Emerson</h4><p begin="00:02:50.83" data-timestamp="170.83">Right in front of the White House, wasn't it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>William Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:02:52.24" data-timestamp="172.24">Right in front of the place. I said, I'm waiting for a delegation of union officials. They're up there on business. And--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Faye Emerson</h4><p begin="00:02:59.13" data-timestamp="179.13">Pretty fast thinking.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:00.92" data-timestamp="180.92">Cimillo got back in his bus, kept driving south. He said he even picked up a hitchhiker, a sailor, who rode with him for two days.</p><p begin="00:03:09.24" data-timestamp="189.24">Then, on the third day, Cimillo and his bus arrived in Hollywood, Florida, just north of Miami. It was late. He said he went for a swim.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>William Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:03:16.92" data-timestamp="196.92">--moonlight bathing. I enjoyed that very much.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Faye Emerson</h4><p begin="00:03:19.55" data-timestamp="199.55">Oh, what a thrill.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>William Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:03:21.00" data-timestamp="201">It was.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:22.30" data-timestamp="202.3">William Cimillo was 1,300 miles from the Bronx. 1,300 miles from New York traffic, from the daily grind. And he was almost out of money. He went to the Gulfstream Park Race Track. He liked to gamble.</p><p begin="00:03:34.63" data-timestamp="214.63">We do not know how much money he put down, but he left the track with $2.60. Same day, he also went to the closest Western Union and sent this telegram to his boss. Quote, "With disabled bus number 1310, stop. In need of $50, stop. Send money to Hollywood, Florida, stop. Cimillo."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>William Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:03:53.71" data-timestamp="233.71">So I'm waiting at the telegraph office for the money, and two policemen come over. They says, you're wanted. I said, what for? They says, for stealing a bus. I said, oh no. I didn't steal that bus. I said, they gave it to me. Well, one word led to the other. They said, you're still arrested.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:13.89" data-timestamp="253.89">Well, today on our radio program, what happens when you take a crazy leap into the unknown, having no idea if it's going to work out, or what's going to happen next. Will you end up on a beach in Florida, happy and carefree? Will you end up in handcuffs? We have three stories of people risking everything in their lives, including the surprising thing that happened next to this bus driver, William Cimillo. Stay with us.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Faye Emerson</h4><p begin="00:04:37.16" data-timestamp="277.16">You did what everybody always wanted to do.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>William Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:04:39.12" data-timestamp="279.12">Just get away from everything. That's what I wanted to do.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Faye Emerson</h4><p begin="00:04:42.49" data-timestamp="282.49">Talking about getting away from it all. Well, if you are planning to get away from it all, you may like to know that no matter where you go, you're almost sure to find friendly, sparkling, Pepsi-Cola waiting for you.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One: Busman’s Holiday</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:53.47" data-timestamp="293.47">And of course, feel free to pop open a delicious Pepsi as you listen to this next act, Act One. By the way, we are not getting paid for that at all. Act One, Busman's Holiday.</p><p begin="00:05:02.87" data-timestamp="302.87">OK. So you remember where we left off. Cimillo had just been arrested in Hollywood, Florida, by two police officers. Joe Richman is the one who dug up this old TV interview, and he picks up the story from there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joe Richman</h4><p begin="00:05:14.44" data-timestamp="314.44">After the arrest, two New York detectives and a mechanic were sent down to Florida to bring Cimillo back, along with his bus. The mechanic drove the bus, but Cimillo told people later, the mechanic couldn't really handle it. His driving made the detectives nervous.</p><p begin="00:05:28.82" data-timestamp="328.82">So the cops actually put Cimillo back behind the wheel. And then right before they arrived in York City, they switched drivers again. They put the mechanic back at the wheel of the bus, and Cimillo dutifully got into his handcuffs.</p><p begin="00:05:45.17" data-timestamp="345.17">So here's what happened next. As the bus pulled up to the steps of the Beach Street Police Station in Manhattan, hundreds of people had gathered, and they were cheering.</p><p begin="00:05:54.54" data-timestamp="354.54">In photographs, you see Cimillo being led through the crowd by the cops, and he has a huge smile. He's beaming. Over the time it took to drive back from Florida to New York, news had spread about the busnapping. William Cimillo had become a folk hero.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Newscaster</h4><p begin="00:06:10.34" data-timestamp="370.34">William Cimillo. The busman who took a holiday. And brother, what a holiday. Just wanted to drive, feel the tang of spring in the air. Busmen in the Bronx greeted their passengers today with a cry, all aboard for Florida! Ah, spring. But now, here is Don Elda.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joe Richman</h4><p begin="00:06:31.65" data-timestamp="391.65">That was NBC. The <i>Daily</i> <i>News</i> wrote, "It must've been a wonderful trip, and we hope Bill's boss will try to understand." From the <i>New</i> <i>York</i> <i>World-Telegram</i>, "We know just how he felt. Who hasn't yearned for escape, for change, for fairer scenes?"</p><p begin="00:06:46.50" data-timestamp="406.5">From as far away as Michigan, <i>The</i> <i>Traverse</i> <i>City</i> <i>Eagle</i> wrote, "Across the nation today, thousands of office workers and laborers went to their humdrum jobs with hearts a little lighter, because of what William L. Cimillo did to escape the same kind of boredom that fills their ordered lives." Cimillo was indicted on charges of grand larceny. He was facing up to 10 years in prison.</p><p begin="00:07:08.90" data-timestamp="428.9">Cimillo's fellow New York City bus drivers-- who you'd think would be the least sympathetic people in the country to his whole joyride-- they organized a fundraiser to pay his legal fees. Letters and telegrams of support came in from around the country. The court of public opinion was delivering its verdict, and soon, the Surface Transportation System of New York decided to drop the charges.</p><p begin="00:07:30.43" data-timestamp="450.43">Not only that, they gave him his job back. On his first day back on the route, a line of people waited to ride Cimillo's bus. One article reported that after school let out, 350 screaming high school girls tried to get onto his 44-seat bus, ignoring three other buses. They wanted his autograph.</p><p begin="00:07:50.15" data-timestamp="470.15">In the end, William Cimillo was incredibly lucky. He took a huge leap, fled home, cut out on his job, committed a crime, and he got away with it, because people loved the story. For the rest of his life, he was that guy who took a city bus to Florida.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:08:06.47" data-timestamp="486.47">He had his day in the sun.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joe Richman</h4><p begin="00:08:09.35" data-timestamp="489.35">This is Richard Cimillo, the bus driver's son. His dad died in 1975.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:08:14.31" data-timestamp="494.31">He just felt like a star, I guess. He was recognized wherever he went. He wasn't just another the bus driver, you know? He was somebody. I guess that's what he felt.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joe Richman</h4><p begin="00:08:30.40" data-timestamp="510.4">You say it so begrudgingly, about him being a star. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:08:38.13" data-timestamp="518.13">Because, you know, every time we went out, every place we went, there was always-- you know, it was like a movie star. Let me put it to you that way. And after a while, I think my mother got tired of it. And I got tired of it. You know what I'm saying? But he never got tired of it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joe Richman</h4><p begin="00:08:59.81" data-timestamp="539.81">Richard and his family never found the story as charming as most New Yorkers did, starting with the day their dad stole bus number 1310.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:09:07.88" data-timestamp="547.88">Let me explain something to you. I was 12 years old at the time. And after I come home from school, my mother was crying.</p><p begin="00:09:19.92" data-timestamp="559.92">And I was, well, Ma, why are you crying? And she said, well, he didn't come home. I wonder where he is. Why wouldn't he come home for supper, and all that. And next day, the same thing. He didn't come home. Not a phone call.</p><p begin="00:09:37.86" data-timestamp="577.86">So she called the garage. They didn't know where he is. The bus never come back to the garage. It just disappeared. And so we used to gather together at my grandmother's house. My mother crying, my grandmother crying, it was like a wake.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joe Richman</h4><p begin="00:10:02.63" data-timestamp="602.63">I mean, you're 12 years old at the time. What did you think might have happened?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:10:07.27" data-timestamp="607.27">Either the bus ran off the road someplace, maybe went into a lake. This is me thinking, you know. Maybe it was a big accident that nobody knew about. So I really thought, deep down, that he must have died.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joe Richman</h4><p begin="00:10:28.83" data-timestamp="628.83">It wasn't until his dad was arrested in Hollywood, Florida, that the family finally knew what had happened. Richard says he never sat down with his dad and really talked about why he did what he did, even as an adult.</p><p begin="00:10:40.71" data-timestamp="640.71">Was it true his dad just got the idea one morning to spontaneously drive to Florida, like he'd said? He didn't plan that at all? Did he really think he'd get away with it? And the biggest question--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:10:52.22" data-timestamp="652.22">I don't know if my mother ever asked, why didn't you call. I never asked. He never called. Not a word. You know, I looked up to him, he was my father.</p><p begin="00:11:06.44" data-timestamp="666.44">But after the Florida incident, I had problems. I had problems looking up. That was a tough time for me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joe Richman</h4><p begin="00:11:17.77" data-timestamp="677.77">Even now, the word he uses when he talks about his dad's bus trip is "embarrassing." But there's someone else in the family who has a completely different take on this. Richard's younger brother, Dennis. Quick heads up, their voices are remarkably similar.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dennis Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:11:32.56" data-timestamp="692.56">It's a good thing to me. To me, he's still my hero, you know?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joe Richman</h4><p begin="00:11:38.33" data-timestamp="698.33">There's one simple reason the two brothers see this so differently. Dennis was just a baby when their father disappeared. He doesn't remember any of it.</p><p begin="00:11:46.27" data-timestamp="706.27">He doesn't remember his mother and grandmother crying. He didn't think his dad had driven into a lake. He didn't picture him dead in an accident. Dennis' vision of the whole thing is closer to <i>Easy</i> <i>Rider,</i> if <i>Easy</i> <i>Rider</i> took place on a municipal bus.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dennis Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:12:01.05" data-timestamp="721.05">I could just see my father [CLAP] putting the pedal to the metal and just go and keep on going. In the drive, just looking out the window and driving. The way my father was, being carefree and saying, you know what? I'm just driving.</p><p begin="00:12:13.97" data-timestamp="733.97">I have nothing on my head. I have no pressure today. I have nothing going on. Let me keep on going.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joe Richman</h4><p begin="00:12:19.96" data-timestamp="739.96">Dennis has a collection of memorabilia about the bus trip. He pulls out a large manila folder. On the front it says, Dad's Event. There are dozens of old photographs and articles, and a videotape with footage from 1947. We go down to the basement to watch it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dennis Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:12:36.50" data-timestamp="756.5">This is from an old newsreel that was taken at the time. It's really short. That's the bus coming in.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joe Richman</h4><p begin="00:12:46.66" data-timestamp="766.66">It's his dad, arriving back in New York.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dennis Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:12:48.76" data-timestamp="768.76">And right now he's being escorted into the courthouse, going in front of the judge, and being arraigned right now. That's it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joe Richman</h4><p begin="00:12:57.69" data-timestamp="777.69">Now, Richard, the older brother, he had told me about the same newsreel. He had seen it the week it was actual news, in a movie theater, when he was 12.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:13:06.46" data-timestamp="786.46">I'm sitting there, and all of a sudden, boom. My father's picture is up on the screen. And I'm looking there, I was stunned. You see your father, as a kid, handcuffed, detectives on both sides of him, bringing him into the courthouse. I don't know anybody that would feel proud of something like that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joe Richman</h4><p begin="00:13:33.74" data-timestamp="813.74">So that's the older brother, Richard. But here in the basement with Dennis, his take on this--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dennis Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:13:38.77" data-timestamp="818.77">I enjoy every minute of it. Just makes me idolize him. I wish I could do things like that sometimes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joe Richman</h4><p begin="00:13:45.59" data-timestamp="825.59">In a way, a small way, Dennis has done that. He sees himself as a free spirit. He says he got that from his dad. He doesn't worry about things too much.</p><p begin="00:13:54.78" data-timestamp="834.78">He likes to gamble. He started his own businesses distributing beer and soda. He was his own boss, which meant no pension, no paid vacation, no security, no guarantees. He says it's different from the life his brother chose.</p><p begin="00:14:08.50" data-timestamp="848.5">And Richard, the older brother, would agree with that. The lesson Richard took from his father's story was to be a responsible person, to think about the consequences of his actions.</p><p begin="00:14:18.51" data-timestamp="858.51">Richard worked all his life as a fireman, which oddly, he calls a safe job. He's retired now. But as it turned out, when I interviewed Richard, he and his wife were getting ready to drive to Florida, as he said, the legit way.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joe Richman</h4><p begin="00:14:32.52" data-timestamp="872.52">Did you ever want to do something like what your dad did? Did you ever want to--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:14:36.35" data-timestamp="876.35">No, no, no. No. No. I knew I didn't want to do something as drastic as that. So that's the biggest difference between my father and me. My father never worried.</p><p begin="00:14:54.43" data-timestamp="894.43">Don't worry, the rent will be paid. Don't worry, we've got this food on the table. Don't worry about it. I worry about everything. I worry about my kids. They had to go to school. They had to go to college.</p><p begin="00:15:08.07" data-timestamp="908.07">I worry about the snow. [LAUGHS] My father never worried about nothing. My father never worried about nothing. He worried-- you know, I worry. I don't sleep nights. I toss and turn, I'm still worrying. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joe Richman</h4><p begin="00:15:26.16" data-timestamp="926.16">So you wish you didn't worry as much?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Cimillo</h4><p begin="00:15:28.48" data-timestamp="928.48">I wish I could've lived that-- yeah. I wish I could not worry.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joe Richman</h4><p begin="00:15:34.78" data-timestamp="934.78">After Richard's dad, William Cimillo, got his job back in 1947, he went on to drive a bus in the Bronx for the next 16 years, with no detours. Once, a reporter asked him, do you still think about hitting the open road? Turning left and heading across the bridge again? Cimillo said, yes, he thought about it. But when you tell somebody a joke, he said, it's never as funny the second time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:16:01.53" data-timestamp="961.53">Joe Richmond.

So now a story about people who want to take a different kind of leap, a kind of quantum leap, you could say.</p><p begin="00:16:44.61" data-timestamp="1004.61">There was this study done by the Pew Research Center and <i>Smithsonian</i> <i>Magazine</i> back in February, published in April. The study was about future technologies. And basically, they called up 1,001 Americans.</p><p begin="00:16:58.27" data-timestamp="1018.27">I do not understand why it's 1,001 and not just 1,000. Maybe 1,001 just seemed sexier or something. Anyway, they called up 1,001 people. They asked them what new technological advances they expected to see in the future, and what technological advances they wanted to see.</p><p begin="00:17:14.35" data-timestamp="1034.35">So there were questions like, would you eat meat that was grown in a lab? Would you get a brain implant to improve your mental capacity? The answer is yes and yes to those, of course.

If there was one futuristic invention that you could own, what would it be? There was no multiple choice. This was an open-ended question.

But the Pew finding did bear out. Most people at the senior center were pretty dismissive of the idea, some more emphatically than others.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Wallace Nottage</h4><p begin="00:31:02.62" data-timestamp="1862.62">Hell, no.

We were called over to talk to him by two women who said, he'd probably have a lot to say to you. And he did. We sat with him for about 20 minutes, until finally, he gave us what felt like the most plausible reason why old people wouldn't want to go back in time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Wallace Nottage</h4><p begin="00:31:28.90" data-timestamp="1888.9">It's not so much that you're at peace with the way things are. It's that you've come to the realization that ain't much going to change.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:31:42.17" data-timestamp="1902.17">Maybe the thing that much older people understand isn't that time travel is frivolous. It's that it's pointless. When you have half a century of past behind you or more, and you look at those decades in one swath, you realize that even if you fix one thing, something else will go wrong.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:31:58.79" data-timestamp="1918.79">Even some of the younger people we talked with felt that way about changing the past.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl</h4><p begin="00:32:02.43" data-timestamp="1922.43">I mean, I'd love to do it.

Even though at that time, they make you sad, if you go back and change everything like that, then you don't learn. So you're sad more often.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:32:39.83" data-timestamp="1959.83">Yeah. So you're saying there's no getting around it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl</h4><p begin="00:32:45.24" data-timestamp="1965.24">No. There really isn't.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:32:52.56" data-timestamp="1972.56">Inevitably, in between things, when Johnny and I were interviewing folks together, we got to talking about whether either of us would want to go back in time for any reason. In Johnny's case, the answer would be--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:33:02.28" data-timestamp="1982.28">No.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:33:03.00" data-timestamp="1983">Too adventurous.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:33:03.91" data-timestamp="1983.91">Not for me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:33:05.06" data-timestamp="1985.06">Whereas I'm one of those people who's thought about this a lot. Like, a lot a lot. There was this point when I obsessively wanted to go back in time to a very particular moment in time, to fix the past.</p><p begin="00:33:17.49" data-timestamp="1997.49">The facts are pretty standard. I was with a woman, and we needed to decide about our future. So I flew to Alaska for the weekend to visit her. And after talking for two days, I finally said that I wasn't ready to be with her.</p><p begin="00:33:32.43" data-timestamp="2012.43">And for a long time after that, I wished I had made the opposite decision, that I had told her yes instead of no. I would sit and pray that I could have that weekend to do over again. I'd picture it all the time.</p><p begin="00:33:48.36" data-timestamp="2028.36">And then, just little by little, there wasn't any big epiphany or anything, I came to see that things were never really right between us and that they never would have been. It took about two years, maybe longer, to understand that. And now she's married and I'm not, but I'm really happy we're not together.</p><p begin="00:34:09.13" data-timestamp="2049.13">And it makes me realize that I have been time traveling. It's just that I've been traveling into the future at 60 minutes per hour. And maybe that's how we fix the past.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:34:25.05" data-timestamp="2065.05">Sean Cole this one of the producers of our radio show.

Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's show, The Leap-- stories of people taking a huge jump into the unknown.</p><p begin="00:35:00.01" data-timestamp="2100.01">We've arrived at Act Three of our program. Act Three, The Wisdom to Know the Difference. So Nancy Updike has this story about somebody considering a very big leap she might try in her own life.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:35:12.59" data-timestamp="2112.59">Tina Dupuy has a story she's told dozens of times, in front of thousands of people. It's about herself at 13 years old, when she was being told by people around her, you have a problem. The problem landed her in AA and started early.</p><p begin="00:35:27.92" data-timestamp="2127.92">She remembers drinking sake when she was five years old at a family reunion. At age 12, pouring herself a big glass of tequila at 3:00 in the morning to drink by herself and watch TV. The kinds of things that can seem cool or no big deal when you're in it, until suddenly they're ruining your life. At a very young age, Tina became what she calls "AA famous" for telling her story at meetings and AA conferences like this one.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:35:53.32" data-timestamp="2153.32">I got sober when I was 13. And for a really long time, I thought that was my part. That was my identity and that was my thing that was going to make me different from absolutely everybody. Even in young people's meetings, I was like, oh yeah, you're 16, whatever. I got sober when I was 13, you know. And last year at ACYPAA--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:36:11.28" data-timestamp="2171.28">ACYPAA stands for All California Young People in Alcoholics Anonymous.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:36:17.19" data-timestamp="2177.19">I was in the room I was staying in. There was this kid there, and he looked really young. And I was like, wow, how old are you? And he said  he was 13. And I was like, wow, how long do you have sober?</p><p begin="00:36:25.81" data-timestamp="2185.81">And he says he has 90 days. And I was like, wow. You know, I got sober when I was 13. I'm cool. And he says, pfft. I got sober when I was 12.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:36:35.73" data-timestamp="2195.73">So Tina got AA famous as Tina D, the girl who got sober when she was 13, and could tell the hell out of her story. And if you're wondering, yes, teenagers can be alcoholics. Almost 700,000 teenage alcoholics in the US, according to most recent government statistics. AA saved Tina's life by the grace of God, or whatever higher power you choose.</p><p begin="00:36:57.79" data-timestamp="2217.79">She quoted <i>The</i> <i>Big</i> <i>Book--</i> that's the official AA book, so much, that people in AA called her a Big Book thumper. It's like a Bible thumper, except with <i>The Big</i> <i>Book.</i> <i></i> And any teenager who shows up at AA today could be handed a Young People in AA pamphlet that starts with Tina's story.</p><p begin="00:37:18.93" data-timestamp="2238.93">That's part one of this-- Tina from age 13 up to 33. Two decades sober. At 33, she'd been married for several years, she'd become a columnist and a political commentator, a long way from the miserable, angry girl she'd been who dropped out of school and spent her time drinking and smoking pot with the older kids, running away from home.</p><p begin="00:37:39.74" data-timestamp="2259.74">AA and sobriety felt so thoroughly part of her by her 30s that she only went to meetings once a month or so to listen and to tell people who were struggling the things other people had told her. Keep coming back. Trust your higher power. Everything happens for a reason. After so much turbulence, her life was finally calm. And then an unwelcome and not at all expected thought.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:38:04.10" data-timestamp="2284.1">One day it occurred to me that everything doesn't happen for a reason. What it is is that everything happens, and then we assign a reason to it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:38:15.30" data-timestamp="2295.3">For someone else, maybe it wouldn't be big deal. For Tina, this was the start of a great slow unraveling. Next to go was belief in a higher power. And then she became fixated on a dangerous question.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:38:30.56" data-timestamp="2310.56">I would wonder what if. What if I drank? Really, what would happen? But I mean, in the Alcoholics Anonymous book, it says if you don't think you're an alcoholic, go drink. And if you can drink normally, awesome.</p><p begin="00:38:48.63" data-timestamp="2328.63">I'm paraphrasing. But it says that. It says, this is how you can find out if you're an alcoholic. Go drink.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:38:55.80" data-timestamp="2335.8">Let's take a minute and consider the scale of what Tina was proposing. Tina had been a full-blown drunk at 13 years old. She found AA. And in every AA meeting, the first thing you say out loud to get started is, I'm an alcoholic.</p><p begin="00:39:10.46" data-timestamp="2350.46">Tina had been saying that her entire adult life and all of her adolescence. Asking herself, should I take a drink, was basically asking, should I turn my back on what I believed about myself for 20 years? There's only one reason to entertain a question that immense, which is, you can't help it.</p><p begin="00:39:28.69" data-timestamp="2368.69">Tina had doubted and questioned her way into a process that she could not stop. It was like she'd started restoring a painting and then realized, I think there's another painting underneath. I want to say one thing. Which is that, when I interviewed Tina, I saw that a lot of what she's talking about, her rethinking of her story, she's still in the middle of figuring it out right now, today.</p><p begin="00:39:55.96" data-timestamp="2395.96">Tina has a few key anecdotes she's told over the years at AA conferences. I've heard a bunch of recordings of her speaking. One story is about a moment when she was 12, with her mom laying down the law. Here's the recording.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:40:08.42" data-timestamp="2408.42">You know, she said, I need you in before 6:00 AM. So when I go to work, I can know that you're OK. And I was like, look lady, I don't need to deal with your rules. I'm out of here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:40:20.41" data-timestamp="2420.41">Notice in this anecdote, Tina is the problem. That's how it is in all the recordings. She's rude to her mom. She's self-destructive. It's a classic AA story about admitting bad behavior, taking responsibility for it. Anything else is just excuses.</p><p begin="00:40:36.15" data-timestamp="2436.15">But the questions Tina was having had stirred up the anything else. It made her go back and look at things she hadn't looked at since she was a kid, especially her relationship with her mom.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:40:46.33" data-timestamp="2446.33">This is so awkward for me to talk about, because I've spent the last 25 years convincing myself that it had nothing to do with that my mommy didn't hug me enough. I don't want anyone to think that I'm blaming my mommy. And I also don't want to feel like I'm ripping on her. Does that make sense?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:41:10.90" data-timestamp="2470.9">Yeah, it does.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:41:12.30" data-timestamp="2472.3">A central tenet of AA is taking responsibility, not going on and on about how other people are always the problem. So let me lay out some things. Tina's parents had been part of a new religious movement, which is the current term for what most of us would still call a cult.</p><p begin="00:41:28.04" data-timestamp="2488.04">They moved around a lot when Tina was little-- four different countries before she was three years old. Then her parents left the cult, and her dad was almost entirely out of the picture after that.</p><p begin="00:41:38.52" data-timestamp="2498.52">Home was a constant battle of wills between Tina and her mother, and she was a defiant kid. She talked back. She swore. She cut school. She'd harass her younger brother. The way her mom responded to the bad behavior, as Tina remembers it, was to tell her she was evil. She was rotten.</p><p begin="00:41:55.94" data-timestamp="2515.94">And when Tina was 11-- 11-- her mother had her committed to hospital under psychiatric care, sort of a kiddie mental ward. Locked up. A tough-love intervention to curb her rebelliousness.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:42:10.01" data-timestamp="2530.01">I kind of knew that she was trying to scare the crap out of me, because then I would do what she said. And I knew. I remember being in that elevator and just thinking, she wants me to cry. She wants me to beg. She wants me to bargain. She wants me to apologize.</p><p begin="00:42:29.04" data-timestamp="2549.04">And she wants me to say, I will do whatever you say. I'm so sorry, just don't leave me here. And I remember thinking, if I show her that, if I do that, then she wins. And so it was basically like I was calling her bluff.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:42:44.52" data-timestamp="2564.52">Not to cry. Not to cry, but also to go like, OK, see you later. Whatever. Not to cry. Not to beg.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:42:49.77" data-timestamp="2569.77">Yeah. This is like, you don't scare me. Nothing you can do can hurt me. And when I got to AA, and people said that they felt dead inside, I felt dead inside. And I just didn't want her to win.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:43:02.98" data-timestamp="2582.98">When you're 11, your parents are the casino. The house pretty much always wins. Your only move as a child is to screw up your own life and hope that it messes with theirs too.</p><p begin="00:43:14.57" data-timestamp="2594.57">Tina was in the hospital for 30 days. It did not make her less defiant. Two years later, her parents decided on a long-term solution to the problem of Tina, which was to make her a ward of the state. When she was 13, they put her into the foster care system.</p><p begin="00:43:31.93" data-timestamp="2611.93">She was sent to a girl's group home, and that's where she stayed until she graduated from high school. The head of the group home corroborated Tina's memory that her parents rarely visited her there. I talked to Tina's mom.</p><p begin="00:43:45.11" data-timestamp="2625.11">She didn't remember calling Tina evil, but she did remember the fighting. And she remembered committing Tina for 30 days to the hospital. She said she was trying to raise two kids on her own and went to a family therapist who gave her the book <i>Tough</i> <i>Love</i> and recommended hospitalizing Tina. Foster care, the group home, is where Tina regularly started going to AA.</p><p begin="00:44:16.29" data-timestamp="2656.29">So one pattern in Tina's AA stories is she's the bad guy. The only bad guy, even though she was a kid. But I noticed another pattern when I was listening through her old recordings of her speeches, which is she never gets drunk in the stories. Here's one of the recordings. Tina's talking about when she went to San Francisco to try and live with her father, briefly.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:44:37.30" data-timestamp="2677.3">I get on the plane and I sit next-- it's a crowded flight, and I sit next to this poor guy. And I start telling him everything about myself. My entire life story, which wasn't that long, about 15 minutes. I was 13. And so I keep on telling him my entire life story, about how I'm going to get back in school, and I'm not going to-- whatever.</p><p begin="00:44:55.18" data-timestamp="2695.18">And then the flight attendant comes by about 15 minutes into the flight with the beverage cart. And so I nudged this guy, and I'm like hey, can you buy me some Jack? And he looks me straight in the eye, and he says, if you're going to change your life, why don't you start now? I was like, the audacity, for this guy to tell me what to do with my life.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:45:18.66" data-timestamp="2718.66">The way she told it in AA, this was yet another example of what an extreme case she was. A 13-year-old who was such a booze hound that she's bugging the guy next to her on a plane to buy her a drink. But notice, she asks for a glass of Jack Daniels, but she doesn't get it. She doesn't drink any Jack Daniels.</p><p begin="00:45:36.35" data-timestamp="2736.35">This is actually one of the reasons Tina was a popular AA speaker. People would come up to her afterwards sometimes, and say, thank you for not just getting up and telling a bunch of boring drinking stories. Here's another recording. Remember the glass of tequila?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:45:50.13" data-timestamp="2750.13">I poured myself a big tumbler of tequila. I was drinking by myself, 3 o'clock in the morning. I was watching <i>Sarah</i> <i>T --</i> <i>Portrait</i> <i>of a</i> <i>Teenage</i> <i>Alcoholic</i>, Linda Blair and Mark Hamill.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:46:03.79" data-timestamp="2763.79">The glass of tequila makes a big entrance, and then nothing happens with it. The rest of the story is about the TV show she was watching. When I asked Tina about the tequila, she told me, right, when she really thought back on it, she could only remember taking a few sips, and that was it.</p><p begin="00:46:19.77" data-timestamp="2779.77">It was only when Tina started having the blasphemous thought in her head, should I take a drink, that she also began to seriously question how much she had drunk as a kid, really. What was true? For instance, that AA pamphlet with Tina's story in it. When Tina read it out loud during our interview, it was the first time she'd looked at the words she'd written in about 10 years.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:46:43.65" data-timestamp="2803.65">Have you read this?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:46:44.97" data-timestamp="2804.97">I haven't read it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:46:46.02" data-timestamp="2806.02">[EXHALES] OK. "I love how alcohol affected me. It numbed all the torment in my brain. I had new friends, the older kids. I was cool, finally. Very quickly though, I started getting into trouble.</p><p begin="00:47:03.96" data-timestamp="2823.96">When I was 11, I was put into what I assumed was a mental hospital. I was relieved to find out that I was crazy. Crazy is cool. I realized much later that the place was a rehab." Ugh. When I read it, I see where I was mistaken.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:47:27.87" data-timestamp="2847.87">What was mistaken was, first of all, the place was not a rehab for alcohol or drug abuse. It was psychiatric hospitalization to fix Tina's attitude. And second, she didn't remember loving how alcohol affected her. She didn't remember it numbing the torment in her brain.</p><p begin="00:47:45.93" data-timestamp="2865.93">Maybe she was in denial or had forgotten, since it was so long ago, how alcohol made her feel. Which is why she now wanted to take a drink. She felt like she had to take a drink. This would be a referendum on her story. Was she an alcoholic or not?</p><p begin="00:48:01.47" data-timestamp="2881.47">And if she wasn't an alcoholic, then what was true from the stories she'd been telling on stage all these years. She had to know. So she and her husband talked through when and how she would take her first drink.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:48:15.00" data-timestamp="2895">Like, what happens if I get drunk, and everything falls apart, and it's horrible and whatever, and I am an alcoholic. And he's like, OK. We'll figure it out then. OK. Then we'll deal with it.</p><p begin="00:48:32.38" data-timestamp="2912.38">And I was like, well, what if I'm not? He's like, OK, then that's great. [LAUGHS] And that was basically-- we had that exact same conversation, I'm embarrassed to report, for about nine months, probably every night.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:48:49.18" data-timestamp="2929.18">Good for him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:48:50.19" data-timestamp="2930.19">I know, right? This is why-- [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:48:54.64" data-timestamp="2934.64">Sounds like a stand up guy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:48:55.69" data-timestamp="2935.69">Yeah, right? He's like, it's OK. And he's like, you don't have to do it. You don't have to drink. Or if you want to, great.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:49:04.56" data-timestamp="2944.56">I mean, I feel like one of the indicators of not being an alcoholic is having a casual take-it-or-leave-it relationship.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:49:13.35" data-timestamp="2953.35">Thank you. See? That's why I was an alcoholic. [LAUGHS] Because it was the mental obsession.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:49:20.13" data-timestamp="2960.13">Right, right. So the fact that you're obsessively talking about, shouldn't I, should I, should I, I mean, did that-- is that the reason that you were having the conversation over and over again? Because every time you had that conversation, that would reinforce the idea that you were an alcoholic, because here you are, bringing it up again. And if you were not an alcoholic, you wouldn't need to be having this conversation as many times as you were.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:49:40.87" data-timestamp="2980.87">Absolutely.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:49:42.73" data-timestamp="2982.73">Wow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:49:43.33" data-timestamp="2983.33">Right. So and then the only way to get out of that is to really like, let's do this. We go to a wine store on the way home. We pay for it.</p><p begin="00:50:00.93" data-timestamp="3000.93">We go home. My husband makes a pasta dish with chicken. He lights two candles, pours two glasses of wine. And so I take a little sip--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:50:12.69" data-timestamp="3012.69">And?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:50:14.15" data-timestamp="3014.15">--and I say, it tastes like the '70s.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:50:17.19" data-timestamp="3017.19">[LAUGHS] Meaning?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:50:18.95" data-timestamp="3018.95">Meaning I had tasted white wine before, but I was like five. I was young. But I remember that taste. That taste immediately came back to me. And then I tried to eat my meal, and it was-- I didn't enjoy the taste. It was really acidic.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:50:38.38" data-timestamp="3038.38">And were you waiting to--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:50:41.34" data-timestamp="3041.34">Oh yeah. So I was like, when am I going to want to like, go and do shots at the corner bar? I mean, who knows? And I went to sleep. You know. Had a glass of wine, and it was completely uneventful.</p><p begin="00:51:06.60" data-timestamp="3066.6"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:51:08.52" data-timestamp="3068.52">I just want to make sure I'm understanding. You are saying you don't think you're an alcoholic.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:51:13.78" data-timestamp="3073.78">I'm not an alcoholic. Not by any measure.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:51:16.74" data-timestamp="3076.74">And now you drink--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:51:19.00" data-timestamp="3079">Now I drink. I'm new at this, right? So I've been drinking for about seven months now. And if I drink more than two, I go to sleep.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:51:32.56" data-timestamp="3092.56">It hasn't changed anything else in your life.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:51:35.49" data-timestamp="3095.49">Not at all. I've had no personality change. I've had none of-- when I start to feel the effects of alcohol, I stop drinking. Now that I actually know what alcoholism is and what normal drinking is-- more importantly, I know what normal drinking is.</p><p begin="00:51:52.59" data-timestamp="3112.59">I'm average. Which is probably the most jarring thing that has happened, that after all of this, I'm incredibly average when it comes to my alcohol consumption.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:52:06.41" data-timestamp="3126.41">Have you told everyone you care about?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:52:11.00" data-timestamp="3131">I've told a very select group of people that I'm drinking. Because one, I'm afraid that people who I have helped over the years in AA will be affected, and it'll make them question their alcoholism. And maybe if they drink again, then I'll feel responsible.</p><p begin="00:52:34.64" data-timestamp="3154.64">There's also the aspect of that I was lying. I mean, I was lying. I was lying to myself. But I was lying. And so I am embarrassed. It seems like I just took a long time to fig-- it's like, it's embarrassing that I didn't have this kind of self awareness.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:53:06.42" data-timestamp="3186.42">The postscript to drinking for Tina has been getting straight in her mind why she thought she was an alcoholic in the first place. How does a non-alcoholic child come to believe that she's a stone drunk? Well, here's how she puts it together now.</p><p begin="00:53:22.21" data-timestamp="3202.21">She went to the first AA meeting just because, nothing else to do. This was in the place she was being held before going to the group home at 13. And one of the AA phrases that caught Tina's ear was, relate to the feelings. Because boy, did she relate.</p><p begin="00:53:37.27" data-timestamp="3217.27">In AA, she heard other people talk, one after another, about things that were so familiar to her. Feeling rejected by their families, winding up in hospital or rehab, feeling trapped and furious and desperate. People said to her, I used to be exactly where you are now. And they had all done what she had done. They had lashed out. They had acted badly.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:53:59.25" data-timestamp="3239.25">There was no other way of explaining at the time. And it wasn't until, I mean, this is very recently, there was no way for me to figure out why I kept on getting locked up. Why I kept on being sent away. Why my mother was fuming at me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:54:19.20" data-timestamp="3259.2">If Tina was an alcoholic, everything made sense. She was the problem. She was the only problem, and if she stuck with the program, she could fix the problem.</p><p begin="00:54:29.15" data-timestamp="3269.15">AA gave Tina a whole life-- goals, discipline, a belief system, people to call when things were bad, people to call when things were good. She graduated from high school at 17, emancipated herself from foster care, started her adult life.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tina Dupuy</h4><p begin="00:54:44.83" data-timestamp="3284.83">It's really liberating to find your people. To find people who you relate to. To find people that ask you to come back. And that was what I experienced. I didn't have people asking me to come back.</p><p begin="00:54:56.77" data-timestamp="3296.77">And they said at every meeting, keep coming back. And I was like, OK. I became a contributing member of society. I mean, that's a phrase that they use. But I stopped feeling sorry for myself.</p><p begin="00:55:11.88" data-timestamp="3311.88">I looked at other people whose lives were much more difficult, for whatever reason, and I stopped feeling sorry for the lot I was given. And being able to feel true happiness, just feeling like I was OK, and there was no crisis, that was what I learned in Alcoholics Anonymous. That is the irony, right? I'm not an alcoholic, but my life was saved by AA.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:55:47.16" data-timestamp="3347.16">I asked Tina if any of her friends are worried about her now that she's drinking. She said, no, not anymore. But she said, sometimes she still has a little voice in her head, saying, yeah you're fine now.</p><p begin="00:55:58.51" data-timestamp="3358.51">But what if there's some threshold you just haven't crossed, and when you do, you turn into the full-blown drunk you always thought you were? But the voice has zero evidence for that scenario. It's just trying to keep the story going.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:15.69" data-timestamp="3375.69">Nancy Updike is one of the producers of our program.</p></div>  </div>
