  <h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:00:11.59" data-timestamp="11.59"> From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Sean Cole sitting in for Ira Glass. And our show today is about rules and when it might be OK to break them, when it's even right to break them. About a year ago, summer 2019, my friend Benjamen Walker was in Nairobi, in Kenya, working on this project with some folks from the London School of Economics. And about four days into his trip, he found himself downtown, idly walking past this big, huge recreation area called Uhuru Park.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Benjamen Walker</h4><p begin="00:00:41.95" data-timestamp="41.95"> And boom. There was the protesters.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:00:46.27" data-timestamp="46.27"> How many of them were there?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Benjamen Walker</h4><p begin="00:00:48.36" data-timestamp="48.36"> Like 300.</p><p begin="00:00:49.58" data-timestamp="49.58">There's, what, 300 people here?</p><p begin="00:00:51.94" data-timestamp="51.94">Just a mass of people-- like, men.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:00:55.99" data-timestamp="55.99"> And the thing they were protesting was Uber. They were Uber drivers on strike. Like I said, 2019. You might remember there were a lot of Uber strikes all over the world around this time.</p><p begin="00:01:07.48" data-timestamp="67.48">Uber had been in Kenya for about four years, and these drivers had the same complaint that's followed the company wherever it's gone. Uber makes too much off the rides. They make too little. They want more of the pie. And they were mad.</p><p begin="00:01:19.39" data-timestamp="79.39">Benjamen waded into the crowd of strikers with a microphone because that's what he does. He hosts a podcast you might have heard of called <i>Benjamen</i> <i>Walker's</i> <i>Theory</i> <i>of</i> <i>Everything.</i> And this story was right up his alley. He's done lots of stories about the gig economy and its discontents. This one driver, Jafar, said one thing that would get them more money is rules, more rules.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jafar</h4><p begin="00:01:40.27" data-timestamp="100.27"> It is just about regulations, number one, number two, regulations, number three, regulations. We need regulations from the government. Because when you are regulated, you cannot come over here, make money, vote in New York Stock Exchange, flow to your whatever-- IPO-- and investor billionaires come and take. Yeah?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Benjamen Walker</h4><p begin="00:02:02.66" data-timestamp="122.66"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jafar</h4><p begin="00:02:03.65" data-timestamp="123.65"> And when we have regulations, we will never see a driver working 18 hours a day. Are we together?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Benjamen Walker</h4><p begin="00:02:09.87" data-timestamp="129.87"> How do you win? That's what I want to know. How do you win?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver</h4><p begin="00:02:12.61" data-timestamp="132.61"> Solidarity.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:02:14.00" data-timestamp="134"> That was another driver there. Solidarity means everyone participating in the work stoppage. Except from what Benjamen saw that week, there were plenty of other Uber drivers still out working. In fact, even as they were all standing there, 300 strong, protesting against Uber--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver 1</h4><p begin="00:02:30.20" data-timestamp="150.2"> We are now on strike, and there's another guy carrying passenger around--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver 2</h4><p begin="00:02:33.26" data-timestamp="153.26"> No, no.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver 1</h4><p begin="00:02:34.22" data-timestamp="154.22"> You see, there is car here packed with passenger.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver 2</h4><p begin="00:02:35.52" data-timestamp="155.52"> Oh, no.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Benjamen Walker</h4><p begin="00:02:37.55" data-timestamp="157.55"> So there is, like, a road that goes through this part of the park. And some guy, Uber driver, decided to go through the protest.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:02:48.32" data-timestamp="168.32"> Through the protest?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Benjamen Walker</h4><p begin="00:02:49.76" data-timestamp="169.76"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:02:51.68" data-timestamp="171.68"> And they know he's an Uber driver how? He has the little Uber sign in his window or something?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Benjamen Walker</h4><p begin="00:02:55.69" data-timestamp="175.69"> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And they swarm his car. And then--</p><p begin="00:03:00.50" data-timestamp="180.5">[AIR HISSING]</p><p begin="00:03:02.42" data-timestamp="182.42">--they let the air out of the tires.</p><p begin="00:03:04.40" data-timestamp="184.4">[WHISTLING]</p><p begin="00:03:06.30" data-timestamp="186.3"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver 1</h4><p begin="00:03:08.21" data-timestamp="188.21"> That's how I'm going to deal with them. Let the car stay down, eh?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver 2</h4><p begin="00:03:12.35" data-timestamp="192.35"> That's how we deal with traitors.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:03:15.38" data-timestamp="195.38"> And what did the guy do?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Benjamen Walker</h4><p begin="00:03:17.50" data-timestamp="197.5"> He seemed pretty upset. He kind of sat there in shock for a while.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:03:22.43" data-timestamp="202.43"> He stayed in his car.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Benjamen Walker</h4><p begin="00:03:23.99" data-timestamp="203.99"> He got out. Eventually, even some of the protesters helped him move it out of the way.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver 1</h4><p begin="00:03:28.35" data-timestamp="208.35"> Of course. He's still our brother, anyway. Good or bad, he's still our brother. We fight them, and we help them at the same time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver 2</h4><p begin="00:03:40.49" data-timestamp="220.49"> Yes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:03:41.96" data-timestamp="221.96"> This was one of two Uber drivers that tried to drive through the middle of the protest while Benjamen was there. And one of the protesters said, oh, the reason they're still driving is that with all of us on strike, the surge pricing kicked in. So the ones who keep at it make more money, which is to say it's hard to beat Uber at this game. House always wins.</p><p begin="00:04:05.83" data-timestamp="245.83">But then as they all stood around discussing this, one of the drivers told Benjamen about a kind of a workaround they had up their sleeve-- a cheat code.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Benjamen Walker</h4><p begin="00:04:13.84" data-timestamp="253.84"> So, all right, now I have a question for you. So the last two days, I took some Ubers, I told you, when I was here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver</h4><p begin="00:04:19.24" data-timestamp="259.24"> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Benjamen Walker</h4><p begin="00:04:19.81" data-timestamp="259.81"> So I'm here till Thursday. I'm not going to take another Uber. What do I do, just find a taxi driver at the hotel?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Benjamen Walker</h4><p begin="00:04:27.19" data-timestamp="267.19"> And he's like, oh, you can just go karura.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver 1</h4><p begin="00:04:30.04" data-timestamp="270.04"> Karura is the way we normally call it. It's our language. Karura, you get a rider. You look at the estimate. You switch off the app. You go with the estimate, which means Uber will not get the commission.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:04:47.02" data-timestamp="287.02"> So just to be clear, imagine you request a ride, and it automatically shows you how much it's going to cost. And when the driver shows up, you say to them, how about I hit cancel on the app and just give you the estimate in cash, cutting out the middleman?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver 1</h4><p begin="00:05:01.12" data-timestamp="301.12"> That is what we call karura.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Benjamen Walker</h4><p begin="00:05:02.68" data-timestamp="302.68"> So if I was to say to a driver, I want to go karura, is that how I would say it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver 1</h4><p begin="00:05:07.09" data-timestamp="307.09"> Yes, yes, can you go karura? [LAUGHS] Yeah, you can tell the driver, can you go karura? He'll understand.</p><p begin="00:05:19.45" data-timestamp="319.45">[CAR DOOR OPENS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver 2</h4><p begin="00:05:21.35" data-timestamp="321.35"> Mr. Benjamen.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Benjamen Walker</h4><p begin="00:05:22.09" data-timestamp="322.09"> Yes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver 2</h4><p begin="00:05:22.47" data-timestamp="322.47"> How are you?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Benjamen Walker</h4><p begin="00:05:22.93" data-timestamp="322.93"> I'm good. And you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver 2</h4><p begin="00:05:23.77" data-timestamp="323.77"> Fine, fine.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Benjamen Walker</h4><p begin="00:05:24.49" data-timestamp="324.49"> Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I want to-- all right, so this ride-- hey, where's my ride? My ride is 380, OK?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver 2</h4><p begin="00:05:33.35" data-timestamp="333.35"> Mm-hm.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Benjamen Walker</h4><p begin="00:05:34.29" data-timestamp="334.29"> I want to give you 400, and we go karura. And I cancel.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver 2</h4><p begin="00:05:38.45" data-timestamp="338.45"> OK.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Benjamen Walker</h4><p begin="00:05:38.83" data-timestamp="338.83"> All right, cool. So I canceled it. Yep.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:05:43.92" data-timestamp="343.92"> So how did it feel once you did that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Benjamen Walker</h4><p begin="00:05:47.04" data-timestamp="347.04"> It felt great. On the one hand, it solves all of my problems for the rest of this trip. But also, I almost feel like I've gotten the answer to my question, because I wanted to know how you win. And there's something about going karura, which is basically using the tools against the company. I mean, it's great.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:06:10.53" data-timestamp="370.53"> And it's subversive. One of the protesters referred to it as economic sabotage-- i.e., until we get more rules governing Uber, we're going to break some.</p><p begin="00:06:25.22" data-timestamp="385.22">I asked Uber if I could talk to a company rep in Kenya about going karura. A spokesperson for all of sub-Saharan Africa wrote back, saying, in part, "Repeat canceling by either a driver or rider could be flagged by our fraud technology, which will then result in an investigation." She also said it's not safe to go off app for the passengers or the drivers-- which, for the record, some of the drivers will tell you too that they don't like to do it, because having a record of the trip is safer for them.</p><p begin="00:06:53.66" data-timestamp="413.66">Of course, going under the radar like this isn't really anything that novel. Cab drivers in New York will sometimes say, hey, how about I turn off the meter and you pay me in cash? But they don't have a name for it. Benjamen and I both wondered, you know, why karura? It's the name of a forest in Nairobi, Karura Forest, but none of the drivers Benjamen rode with could really explain it beyond that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver</h4><p begin="00:07:15.00" data-timestamp="435"> OK, I don't know who came up with that name.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:07:17.92" data-timestamp="437.92"> And when I started calling around to drivers and transport officials in Nairobi, this funny thing happened.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:07:23.15" data-timestamp="443.15"> Karura, yeah. [LAUGHS] That's what we call it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:07:27.68" data-timestamp="447.68"> All of them giggled when I said it. Like, oh, that. You want to know about that? How do you know about that? And one of the drivers said, oh, you can go karura.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver 1</h4><p begin="00:07:38.19" data-timestamp="458.19"> Yeah, it's called-- [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver 2</h4><p begin="00:07:40.41" data-timestamp="460.41"> Yeah, karura. I know karura. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver 3</h4><p begin="00:07:43.60" data-timestamp="463.6"> Yeah. [LAUGHS] Karura.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:07:46.58" data-timestamp="466.58"> One of them told me before Uber came to town, those informal taxis that you haggle with, a lot of them stationed themselves around Karura Forest. So now it was a kind of catch-all phrase for paying any sort of driver under the table. That's the most rational explanation. But there was this other explanation that came from a driver who I'm calling Roger.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roger</h4><p begin="00:08:04.12" data-timestamp="484.12"> Karura, yes. I think I have a clue.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:08:07.19" data-timestamp="487.19"> He's 30 years old, has a one-year-old son, been driving since Uber first came to Kenya. He's also a graphic designer, has a degree in business and IT. He's worked in the hotel industry. He's done a lot of things.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roger</h4><p begin="00:08:18.05" data-timestamp="498.05"> Karura is a forest.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:08:19.48" data-timestamp="499.48"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roger</h4><p begin="00:08:19.81" data-timestamp="499.81"> So we're assuming these are laws that we just got from the forest. So it's quote, unquote, "jungle law." Let me call it jungle law.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:08:27.41" data-timestamp="507.41"> You're saying jungle law?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roger</h4><p begin="00:08:29.09" data-timestamp="509.09"> Yes, jungle law. So it's something not allowed, and again, it's something not in the constitution of Uber.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:08:39.20" data-timestamp="519.2"> Something not in the laws of Uber.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roger</h4><p begin="00:08:41.45" data-timestamp="521.45"> Yes, a jungle law we formed ourself.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:08:44.30" data-timestamp="524.3"> I see. So if Uber are the authorities, then karura is sort of skirting the authorities.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roger</h4><p begin="00:08:50.36" data-timestamp="530.36"> Yes, definitely.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:08:51.68" data-timestamp="531.68"> Got you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roger</h4><p begin="00:08:53.12" data-timestamp="533.12"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:08:53.84" data-timestamp="533.84"> How does that feel when you're going karura versus using the app?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roger</h4><p begin="00:08:58.01" data-timestamp="538.01"> You see, it's a nice feeling. Let me say that, because you're having an extra coin.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:09:03.50" data-timestamp="543.5"> Extra coin.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roger</h4><p begin="00:09:04.40" data-timestamp="544.4"> And you just feel like you've worked for it, and you don't-- and nobody else deserve to get a share of it. I can say you feel empowered in terms of you feel like you're open-minded entrepreneur.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:09:18.29" data-timestamp="558.29"> Entrepreneur, yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roger</h4><p begin="00:09:19.07" data-timestamp="559.07"> Reason being, the company wants this, and the client wants this. So what do you do? You have to open up your mind and either to take the decision to make an extra coin or probably to listen to the company and go home empty-handed.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:09:32.06" data-timestamp="572.06"> Right, it's up to you at that point. You have to make--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roger</h4><p begin="00:09:34.58" data-timestamp="574.58"> Yes, it's up to you.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:09:35.63" data-timestamp="575.63"> --an independent decision.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roger</h4><p begin="00:09:37.01" data-timestamp="577.01"> Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:09:38.63" data-timestamp="578.63"> But it is breaking a rule.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roger</h4><p begin="00:09:40.79" data-timestamp="580.79"> Yes, yes, yes, it is.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:09:42.80" data-timestamp="582.8"> I mean, I guess I wonder if that factors into the decision making of like, well, I know it's a rule. Should I break this rule? Like, we're supposed to follow rules and everything.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roger</h4><p begin="00:09:52.46" data-timestamp="592.46"> Because, you see, at the end of the day, the reason why you get up and decide to get into business is, at the end of the day, you get home with something, you see? So if you decide your priority is following rules, most of the days you're going to get home empty-handed. And most of us are young families. You see, we have wives. We have kids in the house. So if you decide that you're going to be strict to the letter, that you're going to follow all the rules, believe you me, your family is going to sleep hungry.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:10:24.59" data-timestamp="624.59"> It's not just empowering to break the rules sometimes. Sometimes it's necessary to break the rules-- or anyway, it feels like it is. And today on our show, we have stories of people defying regulations, violating the social contract to make a point, and in one case, to strike out against the inequities of a sixth grade class. Please stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One: Time Bandit</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:10:52.85" data-timestamp="652.85"> Act One, Time Bandit. There was a moment this year when I watched someone break the rules right in front of me in the most dramatic way. Dramatic is the operative word because it was during a performance. It wasn't just in front of me. There were hundreds of people in the audience.</p><p begin="00:11:10.05" data-timestamp="670.05">This was during an event that I go to every year, if I can make it, on New Year's Day. It's a 10-hour-long marathon of performances-- I call it a marathon-- at the St. Mark's Poetry Project in a 200-year-old church in Lower Manhattan. So imagine a soaring, cavernous sanctuary with a podium on the altar up front.</p><p begin="00:11:31.87" data-timestamp="691.87">Mostly, the marathon is set up as a kind of churn. There are more than 150 people on the program. And it's not just poetry readings, but bands play, and there are choreographers and comedians. I've seen Patti Smith perform there and Philip Glass.</p><p begin="00:11:45.97" data-timestamp="705.97">And everybody only gets two to three minutes each to read, or play, or whatever. The time limit's a big deal, because they need to fit everybody in. Occasionally, someone gets on stage in between acts and tells everybody to keep it short. Anyway, the sort of rule-shattering moment that happened was not one of the famouses onstage. It was somebody I'd never heard of.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Announcer</h4><p begin="00:12:07.11" data-timestamp="727.11"> Jerome Ellis is a composer, performer, and writer. His recent work--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:12:12.05" data-timestamp="732.05"> Jerome Ellis, composer and musician, but he didn't have an instrument with him or even anything to read off of. He just climbed up on stage, stood in front of the mic. And I have to admit, I was really just looking down at my program and not paying attention when he started talking.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerome Ellis</h4><p begin="00:12:29.87" data-timestamp="749.87"> The Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul has a law mandating that cell phone companies offer a 50%--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:12:58.81" data-timestamp="778.81"> And then he stopped talking, like for a while.

I first encountered this law in a book about strange laws from around the world. The author of the book was mocking the law. But I see in the law an attempt to address the issue of temporal accessibility--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:15:56.90" data-timestamp="956.9"> Temporal accessibility.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerome Ellis</h4><p begin="00:15:58.85" data-timestamp="958.85"> --when it comes to-- when it comes-- when it comes-- when it comes to disabled speech. So when I was first invited to participate in this magnificent event, I was struck by the two-minute time limit, which later became a two- to three-minute time limit. And I understood intuitively that the purpose of this time limit was to create as non-hierarchical a space as possible.</p><p begin="00:16:40.99" data-timestamp="1000.99">But in removing one hierarchy, the time limit introduces another. A time limit assumes that all people have relatively equal access to time through their speech, which is not true. Stuttering is very unpredictable. I can rehearse something as many times as I want, but I don't actually know how long it will take to say anything until I have to say it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:17:18.39" data-timestamp="1038.39"> What you just heard is about half of Jerome's performance as he performed it that night, my commentary not withstanding. It clocks in at about five minutes, practically twice the length permitted itself. I'll play you the second half in a bit. But in just those five minutes, I'd gone from barely paying attention to being totally rapt. Everybody was.</p><p begin="00:17:39.81" data-timestamp="1059.81">The pauses continued, some of them longer than what you just heard. And in an enormous room packed with people, there was barely any other sound. I don't remember hearing a cough or a paper rustle. We were all just kind of spellbound-- partly, I think, because as Jerome said himself, what was happening on stage seemed so very unpredictable. That's what it felt like in the audience.</p><p begin="00:18:04.93" data-timestamp="1084.93">And in the weeks and months since then, I realized I just had all these questions for Jerome, the way you wish you could call up the person who made the weird, obscure movie you just saw that you can't get out of your head or who wrote the book you just read. I just wanted to know how he thought of what he did, how it felt to do that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:18:22.33" data-timestamp="1102.33"> Jerome.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerome Ellis</h4><p begin="00:18:23.39" data-timestamp="1103.39"> Sean, hi.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:18:24.39" data-timestamp="1104.39"> Hey.

He's got the friendliest face and hadn't had a haircut in a while, like everybody. Jerome told me he got the idea after the director of The Poetry Project sent him an email inviting him to perform and mentioned the time limit. And just reading that gave him this twinge of stress.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerome Ellis</h4><p begin="00:18:43.50" data-timestamp="1123.5"> And I was like-- I was like-- I noted the stress. And I was like, oh, I think I'm interested in going towards that stress and exploring that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:18:52.11" data-timestamp="1132.11"> He says, that confusion I felt at first, that's what he was going for. Because it's so common for people to have that feeling upon meeting him. They don't know what's going on until he tells them. It's not easy to bring hundreds of people simultaneously into an experience you live everyday, but he managed it. I also wondered if he had kind of improvised what he was going to say, but he says he wrote it all out ahead of time and rehearsed it, reading it off his phone while walking down the street, which was way easier than reciting it onstage, he says.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:19:23.09" data-timestamp="1163.09"> What was the shortest amount of time that it took when you were preparing, when you were rehearsing it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerome Ellis</h4><p begin="00:19:28.25" data-timestamp="1168.25"> I would say-- I would say two and 1/2 minutes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:19:33.23" data-timestamp="1173.23"> Two and 1/2 minutes, got it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerome Ellis</h4><p begin="00:19:34.64" data-timestamp="1174.64"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:19:35.43" data-timestamp="1175.43"> And that was important to him, he says, to write something that someone who didn't stutter could recite within the time limit. So in that way he was simultaneously adhering to the rules and breaking them at the same time. And since stuttering is unpredictable, Jerome says there was a chance the whole thing could have taken him only four minutes. Then it was a funny situation, where stuttering less might have made it harder for people to understand the point he was trying to make. I figured simply being on stage would make him more likely to stutter, but Jerome says no.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerome Ellis</h4><p begin="00:20:05.06" data-timestamp="1205.06"> It's, in fact, quite soothing to be on stage because it's like-- you know, it's like I actually feel that I'm-- that I have the time. And in some ways, the stage-- the stage-audience relationship is a more temporally accessible environment than other environments of verbal-- verbal-- verbal-- verbal communication that I engage with.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:20:42.92" data-timestamp="1242.92"> Like when he worked at the Columbia Law Library, just to give you some background of his life offstage. Jerome worked at the circulation desk. And not only did he have to take in calls, but he had to transfer calls to other people. So answering the phone, that's one temporal expectation. And then having to explain to someone else who's calling while the first person's on hold, now he's squashed between two temporal expectations. It was stressful.</p><p begin="00:21:09.65" data-timestamp="1269.65">Also, this show and radio in general is not usually an accessible environment for differently-abled speakers. I'm leaving in a lot of Jerome's stutters in the interview part of this story, but I'm still cutting out some of his pauses and repeats-- and mine, for that matter. As a group of professionals, we're biased toward more fluid talkers. I became acutely aware of that while editing our conversation. And just to let you know, I tried to quote, unquote, "clean up" his answers as little as possible because I want to bring you into Jerome's daily experience too.</p><p begin="00:21:41.54" data-timestamp="1301.54">Anyway, I think Jerome stuttered less than usual on the call with me because I know he stutters. He says it helps to disclose it, relaxes him. And then there are other subtler ways that he's able to tame it sometimes when he's talking to people.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerome Ellis</h4><p begin="00:21:55.03" data-timestamp="1315.03"> Sometimes I refer to it as "my stutter," but sometimes I refer to it as "the stutter."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:22:05.49" data-timestamp="1325.49"> The stutter.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerome Ellis</h4><p begin="00:22:07.11" data-timestamp="1327.11"> Because to me, stuttering is not bound to my body, that it is a phenomenon that occurs between me and whoever I'm speaking to. I like to think of it like it's something that we share.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:22:22.41" data-timestamp="1342.41"> And when Jerome's in a conversation with someone, he stutters partly because the burden to talk smoothly is only on him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerome Ellis</h4><p begin="00:22:28.35" data-timestamp="1348.35"> Exactly, exactly. One way of saying that's like, oh, he's stuttering. But there's another way that's like, there is a stutter happening, you know.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:22:35.52" data-timestamp="1355.52"> And we are both contending with it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerome Ellis</h4><p begin="00:22:37.18" data-timestamp="1357.18"> Exactly.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:22:38.34" data-timestamp="1358.34"> And his talk at The Poetry Project was that on a grand scale. That's what he wanted-- for each of us to shoulder a little of the weight of the stutter that was happening.</p><p begin="00:22:54.81" data-timestamp="1374.81">The reason for those long silences on stage is something that I didn't know either. Jerome's particular kind of stutter is sometimes called a glottal block. The way he explains it, when your vocal chords are at rest, they're apart. And then when you go to talk, they come together and vibrate. But sometimes, Jerome's vocal chords get stuck in the middle between being at rest and touching. So he can still make little sounds with his teeth and tongue and lips, but not his voice.</p><p begin="00:23:20.99" data-timestamp="1400.99">And talking to him on Skype, the same thing would happen as when he was on stage. When the glottal block came, he got this look-- a kind of frozen, wide-eyed stare like he was stunned. Except on stage, it was more dramatic. His face would turn upward. And I remember thinking to myself, is that just effort? Is it fear?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerome Ellis</h4><p begin="00:23:41.96" data-timestamp="1421.96"> Yeah. And I know the look you're-- you're speaking about. Yeah, it's like some stutterers will-- their body will-- will, in fact, move a lot while they're stuttering. Their face will-- will move in certain ways, which I do sometimes. But in general, my body response is actually-- is a freezing. And-- and I stop breathing often too. Just like-- like it feels like everything stops for a second or five seconds or longer.</p><p begin="00:24:17.51" data-timestamp="1457.51">So part of it is that-- is that I'm freezing. Part of it feels like my body goes into a kind of supplication or prayer almost. I have a friend who once referred to it as watching-- watching me ask for the word and wait, you know.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:24:43.58" data-timestamp="1483.58"> And wait for it to come?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerome Ellis</h4><p begin="00:24:45.14" data-timestamp="1485.14"> Wait for it to come, yeah. Yeah, because I often look up. It's a very specific state. It's like this-- there are some ways in which I, like, totally leave the room. And I think that speaks to the looking upward. And I then just, like-- I'll, like-- I'll come back once the word arrives.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:25:05.24" data-timestamp="1505.24"> And it wasn't fear, he says. He does have a lot of fears in his daily life-- taking too much of someone's time, not being able to order at Shake Shack when there's a line behind him. But this wasn't that. If he was afraid of anything, it was falling back on the tactics he usually uses to get around a stutter-- synonyms, for example, swapping out a word he's blocked on for one that's easier to say. He didn't want to do that on stage.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerome Ellis</h4><p begin="00:25:29.10" data-timestamp="1529.1"> And I didn't realize that until now, that I think that was the primary fear. And I did do that like two or three times, and I regretted it afterwards.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:25:38.93" data-timestamp="1538.93"> Do you remember which words you did it on, by any chance?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerome Ellis</h4><p begin="00:25:41.86" data-timestamp="1541.86"> Yes.</p><p begin="00:25:42.88" data-timestamp="1542.88">To their customers with--</p><p begin="00:25:45.64" data-timestamp="1545.64">So there's the Portuguese word--</p><p begin="00:25:47.86" data-timestamp="1547.86">With.</p><p begin="00:25:49.08" data-timestamp="1549.08">"Disturbio."</p><p begin="00:25:50.09" data-timestamp="1550.09">[SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]</p><p begin="00:25:52.99" data-timestamp="1552.99">--which I had literally translated to-- in my text, I translated it-- translated it-- translated it-- translated it-- translated it-- translated it to just-- to disturbance.

And I remember very distinctly when I was in middle school that I would be-- I would have my jazz CDs at home. And often, they would be like four tracks, because each track would be like nine minutes long.</p><p begin="00:32:03.00" data-timestamp="1923">And then I remember like looking at my friends' CDs of-- of punk rock, for example, as you mentioned, and like, you know, much shorter tracks.

And there would be this refusal to adhere to the length of a pop song, for example, you know.</p><p begin="00:32:33.43" data-timestamp="1953.43">And for me, there was always a racialized element there too, that there's, like, a Black resistance against certain structures of time, that like, no, this track is 11 minutes long. And if you don't want to listen to it, then don't listen to it. But like-- like, I'm like-- like, we're-- like, our-- what we're trying to achieve in this music is different in some ways than what a three-minute song is trying to achieve.</p><p begin="00:33:08.63" data-timestamp="1988.63">Treating-- treating-- treating-- treating-- treating-- treating-- treating-- treating--</p><p begin="00:33:29.38" data-timestamp="2009.38">As a Black person, I'm also thinking about the way that time and access to time is racially inflected.

    <div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:35:21.03" data-timestamp="2121.03"> It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Sean Cole sitting in for Ira Glass. Today's show, Made to Be Broken, stories about regulations, guidelines, proprieties that people upend for some just cause, as opposed to just 'cause. Act Two of our show today, It's All About the Jeffersons.</p><p begin="00:35:38.86" data-timestamp="2138.86">When he was a kid, comedian Tone Bell was a rule follower. But there was one time he got into really big trouble, broke the rules in a serious way. And there's a Polaroid picture commemorating the moment. In his family, it became one of those iconic photographs, sort of family lore. They just called it the Polaroid. He explained the backstory to producer Elna Baker.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:36:00.85" data-timestamp="2160.85"> When Tone started sixth grade at a new school, he got Ms. Dillard as his homeroom teacher. His neighbor, who we're calling MP, told him, that's not the teacher you want. You want Ms. Jefferson.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:36:12.22" data-timestamp="2172.22"> He definitely let me know that he had the better teacher, but I still didn't know why. I mean, I didn't know if it was because she was young and it was math, but I quickly learned why you wanted Ms. Jefferson.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:36:21.61" data-timestamp="2181.61"> Why do you want Ms. Jefferson?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:36:23.17" data-timestamp="2183.17"> Ms. Jefferson ran her own bank.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:36:25.27" data-timestamp="2185.27"> Yeah, a bank. She was a math teacher, and she gave out fake money to the kids. When you did well on your homework or tests, you'd earn what she called Jefferson bucks, as in Ms. Jefferson, not Thomas. They came in denominations of one, five, and 10, and were actually printed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:36:42.99" data-timestamp="2202.99"> There was definitely a Jefferson mint. They were bills. They were straight up bills-- smaller than a real dollar, bigger than Monopoly money, but it kind of had that feel of Monopoly money. I mean, it looked like-- I mean, 12-year-old money. It looked like money. I'm 99% sure her face was on it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:37:03.12" data-timestamp="2223.12"> Tone wasn't in Ms. Jefferson's homeroom like MP, who'd go to her homeroom four or five times a day. But he had her once a day for math, so he got to earn Jefferson bucks too. You could also make them for good behavior, like being quiet or helping her pass out papers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:37:17.25" data-timestamp="2237.25"> I remember seeing one of my classmates open a door because one of the girls had stuff in her hand. That was like chivalrous, so he end up getting some money. I was like, oh, should you go open doors? I didn't know you could just be out here opening doors. Like, I don't know. I'm putting that on the list. Like, oh shit, I got to open some doors now. I mean, she had to notice it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:37:35.01" data-timestamp="2255.01"> So you're doing what?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:37:36.44" data-timestamp="2256.44"> Oh, you're going above and beyond. I mean, you're knocking stuff off tables. You're knocking people's books off tables and then picking them up just so she can see a good deed. And then you're looking back at her like, you see what I did, right?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:37:47.46" data-timestamp="2267.46"> At the end of the week, you could cash your Jefferson bucks in at the Jefferson Market, a little store Ms. Jefferson set up at her desk. Here, you could buy an extra 10 minutes at recess, as in everyone's coming inside and you're like, here's $5. I'm going to keep playing Red Rover by myself. Or you could buy school supplies, cheap plastic toys like little green army men, and candy, all sorts of candy. This was obviously the top seller. The kids even ranked it in order of preference.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:38:15.70" data-timestamp="2295.7"> So the Fun Dips and the Blow Pops and the Airheads were definitely, I want to say, like the top-tier candy-- maybe Skittles, like the long Jolly Ranchers. And you can tell. You could tell, especially with the Jefferson bucks-- like, if you only had $2, this is the drawer she opens because that's the cheap candy. Like, you don't have enough. Like, you got to pick from this bullshit candy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:38:41.16" data-timestamp="2321.16"> Tone loved it. But then one day, a few weeks into the school year, this thing happened that changed how Tone thought about the Jefferson bucks system, and he couldn't get it out of his head. He was sitting with MP when he noticed something.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:38:54.81" data-timestamp="2334.81"> I mean, I remember him having that plastic pencil case-- you know, pencils, protractor, ruler, all the stuff that you needed. He had so much money-- he had so much money, what that bag was used for turned into a wallet. I mean, it was just wads of Jefferson bucks.</p><p begin="00:39:18.40" data-timestamp="2358.4">I remember him taking that out. And it was almost like a secret because he didn't want everybody to-- and he threw me a couple dollars. And I saw-- I was like, how do you have that much money? It blew my mind. And then hearing like, oh, I made $11 today. I'm like, you made $11 today? Today?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:39:37.42" data-timestamp="2377.42"> [CHUCKLES]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:39:38.77" data-timestamp="2378.77"> It ain't even 2 o'clock yet. You got more time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:39:47.45" data-timestamp="2387.45"> Tone had been working his ass off for weeks, and all he had was six bucks, which was a tiny fraction of what MP had. Tone was earning a minimum wage, and MP was Jeff Bezos. He had to really sit with it before he understood how this could be. MP had Ms. Jefferson for homeroom and for math, which meant that he saw her four times throughout the day. Tone only saw her once for math. Of course, MP had way more Jefferson bucks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:40:16.45" data-timestamp="2416.45"> I remember seeing it and being envious, and being jealous, and wondering how I do that. And just like, let me switch my energy up. I'll study more. I'll be politer. I won't talk in class as much.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:40:29.56" data-timestamp="2429.56"> Tone tried all sorts of strategies to make money. But now that he saw the flaw in the system, he couldn't unsee it. Everything was a reminder of how much more opportunity the kids in her homeroom had.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:40:39.67" data-timestamp="2439.67"> It was almost like they had on fur coats and shit and driving Cadillacs. It almost felt like it made them dress better. It was like they were in the capital and we were District 12. We were just poor people trying to make it, and they are the elite.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:40:56.49" data-timestamp="2456.49"> And did that make you mad?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:40:58.72" data-timestamp="2458.72"> Oh, it made me so fucking mad. It made me so mad because you don't know-- like, you know the rules and you know what's supposed to work, but then it doesn't work. But you see it worked for others.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:41:11.29" data-timestamp="2471.29"> To Tone, having money also meant something really important to him-- impressing girls. There was one girl in particular he had a huge crush on. We'll call her Natasha. She didn't even know Tone existed, but he thought about her all the time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:41:25.92" data-timestamp="2485.92"> Man, Natasha. Her name was on the back of my notebook and stuff. She was active and just long hair, brown skin-- just, like, beautiful. And her maturity level was up there. Her hair was always done. She always wore cool clothes.</p><p begin="00:41:39.58" data-timestamp="2499.58">And she just had the attention. And you saw the dudes who were getting her attention. And look, man, to be honest with you, they just-- they had money. They had Jefferson bucks.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:41:51.55" data-timestamp="2511.55"> And would boys buy girls things with the Jefferson bucks?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:41:54.65" data-timestamp="2514.65"> Oh, yeah. Yeah, we called that tricking off. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, definitely.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:42:00.25" data-timestamp="2520.25"> Tone is 12, trying to figure out the whole girl thing for the first time and desperate to impress them. Luckily, there were other ways to make money besides Ms. Jefferson's class and way more ways to spend it. One of Tone's classmates explained to me that because Ms. Jefferson's store was only open on Friday, the kids came up with an underground economy of their own, a black market fueled by Jefferson bucks that was open every day of the week. You could buy anything there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:42:29.96" data-timestamp="2549.96"> If somebody had jello, chocolate, or their dessert, we're like, hey, Maggie, three bucks for the half of your slice of pizza on Friday. I mean, somebody might sell you a pencil half price what Ms. Jefferson's going to sell it. Ms. Jefferson might have been selling the pencil, a graphic pencil, for $2, and you might be able to get it for $1. I mean, it became a legal tender basically through our sixth grade.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:42:50.70" data-timestamp="2570.7"> The kids did a lot of shady things, all under the table. Like kids in Ms. Jefferson's class would pay kids in Ms. Dillard's 10 to 20 Jefferson bucks to do their homework. That's how the black market worked if you had money. If you didn't--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:43:03.26" data-timestamp="2583.26"> You've got to figure out how to leverage what they need so that you can get something that you're not getting, which is the Jefferson buck. I mean, there were moments where I remember, if you're not paying attention to your books, you might have a textbook stolen, and you're going to need five Jefferson bucks to get your book back.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:43:24.95" data-timestamp="2604.95"> By December, the lopsidedness of Ms. Jefferson's system was clear to everyone in Ms. Dillard's homeroom. They complained to each other about it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:43:32.59" data-timestamp="2612.59"> And it's like, this shit is rigged. I don't remember who it was, but I remember a lot of us being like, yo, what do we need to do?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:43:43.67" data-timestamp="2623.67"> Did you ever say that to her?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:43:46.31" data-timestamp="2626.31"> Yeah, we brought it up, of how to-- like, how do we do more if you're not seeing it? I'm trying my best. And it's like nay, man. We got to have a town hall.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:43:57.14" data-timestamp="2637.14"> A kid brought it up one day in math class, and several others, including Tone, immediately jumped on board. I wasn't able to find Ms. Jefferson to get her side of this, but the way Tone remembers it, Ms. Jefferson shut this discussion down. If they wanted more money, she said, they needed to try harder, period, end of discussion.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:44:16.07" data-timestamp="2656.07"> It's like, hey, man, everybody has the same opportunity. And it's like, no, they don't. Well, you got to work harder, and you got to try harder. And then after-- I'm saying months of doing that-- nothing, still nothing. And I just had this moment where I was like, I-- I've got to rob the Jefferson bank. Like, I'm going, there's no other way.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:44:49.11" data-timestamp="2689.11"> Again, Tone was a rule follower. His dad was really strict. So this was wildly out of character. But as Bertolt Brecht said in a very different context, who's the greater criminal, the man who robs a bank or the man who founds one? Tone figured, if she can make-believe a bank, then he could rob that make-believe bank without any consequences.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:45:10.74" data-timestamp="2710.74"> And then so I kind of just-- I mean, I guess I just kind of started casing Ms. Jefferson's actions. I knew we left a window open. At this point, we had her right before lunch. I knew where she kept it. I knew where the store was. I knew where the money was.</p><p begin="00:45:27.96" data-timestamp="2727.96">So at lunch-- so I decided a couple days before, I'm going to start going to the bathroom during lunch. I would go to the bathroom, come back. Spend, like, a little extra time, come back. You know, for a few days, just so this wouldn't look awkward either.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:45:41.07" data-timestamp="2741.07"> He's testing out how long he can be away without people noticing. Ms. Jefferson's classroom is locked during lunch, but she has a window that faces the courtyard. His plan is to slip in through the window, grab some money, and head out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:45:53.98" data-timestamp="2753.98"> So I was like, OK, today's the day. You know, I go the bathroom. And I asked the-- you know, excuse me, can I go to the bathroom real quick? I don't feel well.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:46:01.71" data-timestamp="2761.71"> He goes straight to Ms. Jefferson's window in the courtyard, pushes it open, and climbs in. His heart is racing. And then he goes over to the one place every kid knows is forbidden, his teacher's desk. He knows exactly where Ms. Jefferson keeps the money, in the bottom right drawer. He opens the drawer and sees the metal cashbox. It's unlocked.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:46:24.01" data-timestamp="2784.01"> And so I open the box up. And, you know, I mean, just money. Even in that moment, I was like, oh-- this was like a Scrooge McDuck moment. Like, I am swimming in Jefferson bucks, but you can't get overzealous. Because if you take everything, that's definitely going to be noticeable. So you have to take enough to feel comfortable, but not enough to set off any alarms.</p><p begin="00:46:46.65" data-timestamp="2806.65">And drawer opened up, popped the box, and grabbed out a nice-- I mean-- I mean, I'm going to say an inch thick of Jefferson bucks. I'm going to say, like, an inch, like a nice-- probably equivalent to what MP had in his pencil holder. And so I split that in half, and then I stuffed my pockets. And I'm like, I got to get the fuck out of here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:47:12.93" data-timestamp="2832.93"> Tone is running out of time. He does a sweep of the room, then he exits through the classroom door and locks it behind him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:47:19.81" data-timestamp="2839.81"> I'm good. Like, I'm home free. So I close the door. I back out. Door is locked. And I'm starting to walk around the corner, and I've run into Natasha. Like, blew my mind. I'm also like, why is she in the hallway?</p><p begin="00:47:34.35" data-timestamp="2854.35">And I mean, she looks at me. She knows that I'm not supposed to be here. But also she's looking at me like, why were you in Ms. Jefferson's class? And I mean, I swear to you, she just looks me up and down and just notices my pockets because, I mean, I got dollar bills-- I got Jefferson bucks, I mean, just popping out of my pockets. Oh, man.</p><p begin="00:47:54.69" data-timestamp="2874.69">And she just looks me up and down. And she was like, oh. [LAUGHS] She's goes, oh, I'm going to need some of that. And I'm like, oh my god. Like, this girl who I'm infatuated with, one, is robbing me. But like, to not get caught, I have to give this bitch hush money.</p><p begin="00:48:19.21" data-timestamp="2899.21">So I think I gave her my whole left pocket, if I'm not mistaken, because it was already split in half. And right before I go back to lunch, I'm like, hey, just do not say nothing about-- are we good? And just like, hey, man. You know, we kind of had a cone of silence. Like, can we keep this shit a secret?</p><p begin="00:48:44.93" data-timestamp="2924.93">Come back to Ms. Dillard's class. By the time we start the next period, I mean, everybody knows about it. I heard you took Jefferson bucks. I was like, mm-mm, I didn't take any Jefferson-- I was at lunch with you the whole time. I went to the bathroom. That's about it. So you start to see the eyeballs come at you like, oh, man, too many people know.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:49:00.66" data-timestamp="2940.66"> Within no time, word spreads to Ms. Jefferson, and then the principal or vice principal. Tone can't remember which.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:49:08.60" data-timestamp="2948.6"> And they pull me into the hallway. Ms. Dillard comes out. They're like, where were you during lunch? And I was like, I went to the bathroom. I asked for permission. And they're like, so you didn't go anywhere else? And I was like, no, I just went, and I came back. And they're like, OK, so what's in your pockets? And I was like, nothing.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:49:27.68" data-timestamp="2967.68"> It's still in your pocket?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:49:29.33" data-timestamp="2969.33"> I didn't have time to put it up.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:49:31.05" data-timestamp="2971.05"> Oh, you are the worst criminal.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:49:32.88" data-timestamp="2972.88"> [LAUGHS] I didn't have time to-- my plan was getting foiled in front of my eyes because I had too many eyeballs on me to take it out of my-- there's nothing I could do. I felt I was wearing a wire and people knew about it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:49:45.47" data-timestamp="2985.47"> Even with the money as evidence, Tone still won't confess. So they turn up the heat. Into the hallway walks Natasha.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:49:53.37" data-timestamp="2993.37"> Yeah, she comes out. And she was like, well, I saw him coming out of Ms. Jefferson's room. And I was like, what? I mean, like, it was unreal.</p><p begin="00:50:04.47" data-timestamp="3004.47">That's why I gave you the money, not to talk, especially to these people. That's why I gave it to you. Like, if you was going to tell the whole time, I would've just kept all of it. Like, if this was how it was going to end-- like, that's what the money was for. And I go to the office, and it's our-- it's either our principal, the vice principal, but it's definitely Ms. Jefferson.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:50:27.38" data-timestamp="3027.38"> Did she ask you anything?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:50:29.45" data-timestamp="3029.45"> She was definitely disappointed. She was definitely disappointed. And then, you know, she's-- why would you do that? And I was real. And I was like, look, man, it wasn't to be malicious. It was like, we struggling out here.</p><p begin="00:50:44.35" data-timestamp="3044.35">I'm sick of seeing people with three chocolate milks, and five Blow Pops and Ring Pops and all this kind of shit, and I can't do nothing. And it's like, well, there's a better way to go about it. I tried that. And you can't tell me that you don't remember. We kind of all talked about it.</p><p begin="00:51:00.78" data-timestamp="3060.78">And I've tried everything. I've tried what you said to do. I've tried to make better grades. I've tried to be more chivalrous. I've tried to not get my name on the board. I've tried all these things, and they don't work. I've tried to be fair, and you're not being fair.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:51:21.84" data-timestamp="3081.84"> Tone's punishment, the worst possible outcome. They call his dad. In Tone's mind, this is his last day on Earth. He gets home, goes straight to the fridge, gets a bowl of ice cream, and heads to his room to watch porn. He figures he might as well go out with a bang.</p><p begin="00:51:38.39" data-timestamp="3098.39">He's refilling his bowl when he notices something. There's a chair in the middle of the kitchen. His dad walks in, gestures to the chair, and says--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:51:47.66" data-timestamp="3107.66"> Oh, no, no, no, no. No. You know what time it is. And like, I'm like, ooh, fuck. You know, I've got to bend over the back of his chair, and I'm just taking it. I mean, I'm just breaking down.</p><p begin="00:52:05.59" data-timestamp="3125.59">And then my father just like-- he stops. I'm crying and everything. And then he goes, hey, Tone. And I look back, and my father takes a Polaroid of me crying with the-- I mean, like it's-- pants are at my ankles, ass just-- I mean, face is like-- I mean, took a Polaroid.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:52:28.20" data-timestamp="3148.2"> And what was the expression on your face?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:52:32.02" data-timestamp="3152.02"> The expression-- pain and defeat.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:52:38.72" data-timestamp="3158.72"> Tone never got another spanking. He never went rogue again. And part of that has to do with the Polaroid. Anytime he started acting up, his dad would remind him of that photo, and Tone would course correct.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:52:50.38" data-timestamp="3170.38"> I mean, it was, like, Pavlovian. It was like-- I mean, that photo made me break down.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:53:02.17" data-timestamp="3182.17"> Tone was ashamed. He felt bad for robbing the bank. But the thing is, it actually got him what he wanted. Not like he expected-- he didn't get Jefferson bucks. But he got justice. Ms. Jefferson changed the rules. No matter how many times a day you saw her, you could only earn money during the hour of math class. It became a level playing field.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:53:24.28" data-timestamp="3204.28"> I feel like I do remember people kind of being disappointed. There was people in Ms. Jefferson's class that were pissed, I'm sure. But everybody who wasn't in Ms. Jefferson's class was like, yo, about time.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:53:34.95" data-timestamp="3214.95"> Mm-hm. Yeah. But you know what's interesting about what you're saying right now is just, like, the kids in Ms. Jefferson's class are going to be pissed at you because they don't have the privilege they used to have, right? But they also have no concept of how you've been feeling all school year.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:53:51.68" data-timestamp="3231.68"> Exactly. You don't know it's different for me. Well, I'm in her class, and you get to take her class. Isn't that the same? No. I know it should be, but it's not. That doesn't matter to me. Well, then I have to do something. It felt unfair.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:54:07.24" data-timestamp="3247.24"> For Tone, this was always just a funny story he told about his dad's awkward Polaroid. But he started talking to me about it a few weeks ago, during the height of the recent protests. And that made him think about the story differently.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:54:20.09" data-timestamp="3260.09"> There's a parallel that I've never noticed or looked for, I guess, between how communities react when they don't feel like they're being treated fairly.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:54:30.04" data-timestamp="3270.04"> Well, you know, what it makes me think of is, like, Jesus always talked in parables.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:54:35.77" data-timestamp="3275.77"> Right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:54:36.19" data-timestamp="3276.19"> And I feel like your Jefferson bucks story is such a perfect parable.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tone Bell</h4><p begin="00:54:41.55" data-timestamp="3281.55"> I agree. When the rules are the same for everyone and some people thrive and some people don't, but everyone's following them, why is it not equal? Why is it not fair? And I don't even know if it can be answered most of the time. But the question has to be asked.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:55:10.58" data-timestamp="3310.58"> If this is a parable, almost everything lines up-- the systematic inequality, the unfairness, how sometimes you have to break the rules in order for them to change. I see what I'm supposed to learn from everyone. But the one thing neither of us could figure out is, what are we supposed to learn from Natasha? Tone never told anyone she took half the money. A crush is a crush. So the real robber actually got away with it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:55:42.88" data-timestamp="3342.88"> Elna Baker is one of the producers on our show. Tone Bell performed a version of this story on the Comedy Central program <i>This</i> <i>Is</i> <i>Not</i> <i>Happening.</i> His first hour-long special, "Can't Cancel This," is now available on Showtime and Amazon Prime.</p></div>  </div>

Yeah, we call that tricking off.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:57:22.27" data-timestamp="3442.27"> I'm Sean Cole.
