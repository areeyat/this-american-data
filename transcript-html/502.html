  <h3>Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.84" data-timestamp="0.84">When the phone calls started, Meron Estefanos was leading a quiet, busy life. She was a single mom with two young boys, going to school, holding down a couple jobs, including working as a freelance radio reporter. She'd been born in Eritrea in East Africa, moved to Sweden as a teenager. She was living in a suburb of Stockholm.</p><p begin="00:00:19.02" data-timestamp="19.02">She was also a human rights activist, focusing on Eritrea. That's what her radio stories were about, too. And so she was used to people phoning her with tips and leads now and then. But at the end of February 2011 came this phone call--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:00:31.59" data-timestamp="31.59">This guy from UK called me and told me that his brother was kidnapped and that he was being asked $20,000 for the release of his brother.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:40.99" data-timestamp="40.99">The man said his brother was with other people who had been kidnapped, all of them Eritrean, and that they were in the desert, far from Eritrea. They were on the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt, close to the border with Israel. He said they were being tortured and held for ransom-- $20,000 each, which seemed absurdly high to Meron. Eritrea's a country where the average person makes less than $1,000 a year.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:01:03.16" data-timestamp="63.16">I had a hard time believing that, actually, what he was telling me was true. And he understood that people were hard time believing. So he said, well, if you don't believe me, here. So he gave me two phone numbers. He said you can talk to the hostages yourself.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:18.99" data-timestamp="78.99">Meron wanted it to be a lie. And she couldn't bring herself to try the numbers. But then that night, she couldn't sleep thinking about it. So--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:01:28.12" data-timestamp="88.12">[INAUDIBLE].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:01:30.04" data-timestamp="90.04">Hello?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:01:31.49" data-timestamp="91.49">Hello.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:01:32.46" data-timestamp="92.46">Hello, salaam. Meron Estefanos. [SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:35.91" data-timestamp="95.91">Meron called the numbers. And remember, she was a radio reporter. She did reporting for two radio stations that broadcast by shortwave and satellite into Eritrea and over the internet to Eritrean emigres around the world. So she recorded these phone calls, hoping she could do a story. This is one of the first calls she made. And yes, someone did pick up, and yes, he said he was being held hostage. He told her his name was Biniam, he was 22 years old, that he'd fled Eritrea in 2010, had been living in a refugee camp in Sudan, working at a farm, when he was kidnapped and taken to Sinai.</p><p begin="00:02:07.28" data-timestamp="127.28">He said he was there with other people in a group of 28. There had been 29, he said, but one had died. They were being held by some Bedouins, Biniam said. Meron came to learn that the hostages were allowed access to cell phones so they could beg their families to send money. We have interpreters translating what Biniam and Meron said to each other.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:02:24.89" data-timestamp="144.89">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:02:27.84" data-timestamp="147.84">The place we are held at is an underground facility. They have us chained. And they have taken three people to the outside. We hear cries from the outside. We don't know whether they are being tortured or whether they are dead.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:02:41.07" data-timestamp="161.07">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:02:45.31" data-timestamp="165.31">Tell me more. What are they saying to you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:02:47.89" data-timestamp="167.89">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:02:49.76" data-timestamp="169.76">The people who are holding us are saying that unless we make good on our investment, there will not be a solution. They tell us they will drink our blood.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:02:58.41" data-timestamp="178.41">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:04.48" data-timestamp="184.48">Meron had heard stories of Eritreans being kidnapped and held hostage in the Sinai before this call. People had been fleeing Eritrea for years. Its government is one of the most repressive in the world. And sometimes, people got kidnapped, either on their way out on the road or from refugee camps right across the border.</p><p begin="00:03:20.49" data-timestamp="200.49">But it was still this shadowy thing that human rights groups were just starting to report on at that point in 2011. It wasn't clear how many people it was happening to. And the ransom surprised her, like I said-- the size of it, $20,000. Meron had never heard of a ransom that high. It didn't seem like it could be real. And come on, we'll drink your blood? Really? It could even be some kind of hoax, a scam where they trump up how desperate they were, to get money sent.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:03:45.82" data-timestamp="225.82">I kept telling myself, OK. Maybe they are lying. It's just too hard to believe that this many people can get kidnapped and tortured and a lot of money. It's just hard. But at the same time, I kept saying to myself, what if it's true and I did not believe them? Then I'll regret this the rest of my life.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:14.69" data-timestamp="254.69">So Meron calls back. And thanks to caller ID, they call her back. And then, reluctantly, she gets pulled in deeper and deeper into this situation where it is not clear exactly what is true and what isn't, and there are people who are saying their lives are in imminent danger, and it's happening thousands of miles away. But it is also happening right there in her own home, over the telephone. Imagine for a second if hostages started phoning you at your house, while you're at the dinner table, while you're sleeping.</p><p begin="00:04:44.82" data-timestamp="284.82">Well, from WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass as you'll hear, Meron ends up making lots of recordings over the phone and gets more and more involved with these people who are claiming to be hostages. And reporter Yowei Shaw; one of our producers, Brian Reed; and an Eritrean journalist, Bealfan Haile went through those recordings.</p><p begin="00:05:03.27" data-timestamp="303.27">According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, there are now more migrants and displaced people in the world than ever-- over 65 million. This is a story about the severe danger some of them face. A warning to listeners-- this is a story of hostages and people having their lives threatened. There is some content that is violent and probably not right for children to listen to. Here's reporter Yowei Shaw.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One: Act One</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:05:27.74" data-timestamp="327.74">Meron had a lot of questions for these people on the phone. She started with Biniam, the guy you just heard.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:05:33.27" data-timestamp="333.27">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:05:35.92" data-timestamp="335.92">So tell me, explain to me, from morning till night, what does your day look like?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:05:41.29" data-timestamp="341.29">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:05:44.45" data-timestamp="344.45">I cannot even begin to describe the situation in here.

And they torture us.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:05:58.36" data-timestamp="358.36">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:06:01.79" data-timestamp="361.79">And towards the evening, after they torture us for so many hours, they give us one bread and they give us very small amounts of water.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:06:10.79" data-timestamp="370.79">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:06:12.29" data-timestamp="372.29">We've been tortured so much that we have wounds all over our backs, and we have lost our appetites as a result of that. We spend our days yearning for death.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:06:23.98" data-timestamp="383.98">Meron listened, took notes, finished with Biniam. And then he passed her on to the next hostage, and then the next-- a 21-year-old named Dejen who told her that he and about five of the others were almost completely naked. For 28 days, he'd been wearing just his underwear.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:06:40.85" data-timestamp="400.85">Do they beat you up?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dejen</h4><p begin="00:06:42.34" data-timestamp="402.34">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:06:45.43" data-timestamp="405.43">We could have actually gotten used to the beating, but they're introducing us to new methods of torture that were unknown to us. They come here every hour after having tea and food, and they start electrocuting us on our heads as one person steps on our legs.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dejen</h4><p begin="00:07:01.28" data-timestamp="421.28">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:07:04.51" data-timestamp="424.51">To them, our lives are much less valuable than a goat or any animal.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:07:09.49" data-timestamp="429.49">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:07:10.94" data-timestamp="430.94">OK, Dejen.

They were shackled together in groups of five to 10 people. The traffickers would electrocute them, melt plastic bags, and drip the hot liquid on their backs. They said, we own you. You need to bring $20,000. If not, another option we have is we can simply open you up and harvest your kidneys and hearts.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:08:06.96" data-timestamp="486.96">By the time Meron was talking to the eighth hostage, Yohannes, you can hear in the recording that she's at a loss for what to say.

It's just shock. It was hard to accept what I was hearing, the stories they were telling me, the things they were going through. I was just-- from a normal life, it's like going to another world that you never thought existed.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:10:22.27" data-timestamp="622.27">She still wasn't entirely certain whether this call was legit, or if it was, how much of what she was being told was real. But she knew it might be real. She knew it was true that Eritreans were being held in Sinai. And if these 28 people were there, maybe she could help them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:10:46.78" data-timestamp="646.78">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:10:50.84" data-timestamp="650.84">Meron began broadcasting her interviews on Tigrinya-language radio stations. These were not carefully-crafted feature stories. She felt she didn't have time for that. They were basically raw, unedited recordings of her phone calls, with hostages describing the torture and begging for help on the air.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:11:08.33" data-timestamp="668.33">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:11:11.17" data-timestamp="671.17">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:11:17.53" data-timestamp="677.53">Meron also reached out to other reporters to try and get them to cover the story.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:11:21.96" data-timestamp="681.96">Oh, it's a very touching story, but it wouldn't sell. That's the kind of reply I would get when I called to some journalists that I knew. Sorry, we can't help you. Oh, it's not connected to Sweden. Sorry. So this is the kind of reply that I was getting.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:11:35.17" data-timestamp="695.17">Meron did manage to get a BBC reporter interested in the hostages' story, but he asked for proof. How could he verify that people were being held and tortured in Sinai? She put him in touch with a group of doctors, Physicians for Human Rights Israel, who'd been helping and interviewing Eritreans coming out of Sinai. They'd photographed people's injuries from beatings, shackles, and burns.</p><p begin="00:11:57.23" data-timestamp="717.23">In the end, though, BBC story didn't seem to get any attention. Meron went on a phone and email blitz, trying to publicize the issue but also hoping that something could be done for these 28 people. She contacted governments, NGOs, the United Nations Refugee Agency.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:12:14.18" data-timestamp="734.18">There was a lot of disappointment at the time-- disappointment of all institutions and disappointed at journalists because I thought that within weeks, I would be able to solve it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:12:28.07" data-timestamp="748.07">Some organizations were taking small steps, like pressuring Egypt to take action. Early 2011 was incredibly bad timing for anyone trying to fix a problem in Sinai. The Arab Spring was going strong. Egypt was going through a revolution. Meron first got in touch with the hostages the same month that Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak, was forced to step down.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:12:50.19" data-timestamp="770.19">There was no government. That was a problem. They didn't have government, so that was also one of the biggest problems that we had because we didn't know who to talk to because there was no government.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:13:02.51" data-timestamp="782.51">Hello.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:13:03.35" data-timestamp="783.35">Hello, hello. Biniam?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:13:05.03" data-timestamp="785.03">The hostages continued to call Meron, and the one she talked to the most was Biniam, the first guy in that phone call she recorded. He became kind of a spokesman for the group, and they developed a good rapport.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:13:15.23" data-timestamp="795.23">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:13:17.40" data-timestamp="797.4">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:13:21.52" data-timestamp="801.52">Very soon, Meron was talking to Biniam nearly every day, often multiple times a day. She wanted to move on from the story, but the calls wouldn't stop.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:13:30.97" data-timestamp="810.97">They saved my number, so it was really hard to even avoid it, even if I wanted to. I really wanted to avoid it. I could not just ignore those phone calls.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:13:43.71" data-timestamp="823.71">The way it worked is the hostages would call and hang up before she answered so she could see their number and call back, since they didn't have enough phone credit. And in these conversations, Meron was always trying to figure out what was real in what the hostages were telling her. She knew that some amount of torture and killing needed to be happening to convince hostages' families to pay the insanely high ransoms.</p><p begin="00:14:06.29" data-timestamp="846.29">But the traffickers couldn't kill too many people. It would cut into profits. So she figured they forced the hostages to exaggerate or lie sometimes.

She had left Eritrea in hopes of finding a job to support her mom, who was very poor and trying to raise four young children she'd taken in. Meron felt especially close to Semhar.</p><p begin="00:16:35.61" data-timestamp="995.61">And during this call, Semhar kept telling Meron how terrified she was, how she was on the verge of death, how she just couldn't bear it anymore. Meron started crying.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:16:44.55" data-timestamp="1004.55">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Semhar</h4><p begin="00:16:46.64" data-timestamp="1006.64">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:16:49.57" data-timestamp="1009.57">Her story really touched me, and now I feel like she's my younger sister. I mean, I've heard so many people crying in the Sinai. But she's a very special girl that just, I mean, the way she would beg was really--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:17:08.76" data-timestamp="1028.76">How would she beg? How was it different?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:17:16.32" data-timestamp="1036.32">I mean, it's just different. Like she would say, my sister, Meron, please, please. I don't know. It's hard. You have to understand Tigrinya to get it. So it was just different.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:17:26.79" data-timestamp="1046.79">In fact, as we were interpreting the phone call you just heard, when we got to Semhar, our interpreter, who'd been listening to these recordings for hours, began crying herself and had to stop. She said she'd never heard anyone beg like that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Semhar</h4><p begin="00:17:39.45" data-timestamp="1059.45">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:17:45.36" data-timestamp="1065.36">And the male hostages who were in captivity with Semhar felt the same way. They told Meron that Semhar had it especially bad, even worse than them. One of the guards was taking her at night, and she came back crying. They didn't know what he was doing with her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:18:00.04" data-timestamp="1080.04">They were saying, we know that you cannot save all of us. We are 28 people. But at least save this girl, and then we'll be happy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:18:09.98" data-timestamp="1089.98">Meron recorded all of these phone calls from the living room of her one-bedroom apartment, surrounded by photographs of her kids and lemon-painted walls in the woods of a quiet suburb of Stockholm. Hostages called at all hours-- during meals or in the middle of the night or early in the morning. She'd have to watch her boys while talking to the hostages. You can sometimes hear her kids in the recordings playing nearby.</p><p begin="00:18:32.95" data-timestamp="1112.95">And it wasn't the kind of work that ended when she hung up the phone.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:18:36.32" data-timestamp="1116.32">I couldn't sleep. All I was doing is just crying. And the first three weeks, I couldn't even take care of my kids because I was just almost going crazy. The screams were just-- I could hear the screams 24 hours in my head. I couldn't breathe. Sometimes when you're tired, you say [EXHALES]. And that feels good, to breathe out. But for three weeks, I couldn't do that. I would be trying-- [EXHALES]-- and still, it doesn't come out.</p><p begin="00:19:12.86" data-timestamp="1152.86">I remember it was around 11:00 at night. And I had quit smoking for a very long time. And it was, like, five to 11:00. And the store near my house closes at 11:00. And I was rushing to buy cigarettes. And I remember taking the first smoke, and it was like for the first time, I was able to breathe out. I could exhale, and it felt really good.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:19:42.38" data-timestamp="1182.38">Things only seemed to be getting worse. The hostages told her that a fifth person had died, and Meron says that's when she reached a turning point.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:19:50.77" data-timestamp="1190.77">That's when I decided now, I cannot take this. I cannot just sit by, and the world is not doing anything. At least I have to save one person. And that's when I decided to do fundraising to collect money for the girl, that Semhar will be the one.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:20:11.68" data-timestamp="1211.68">Meron knew that paying ransom was a bad idea. She knew it just encouraged more hostage-taking, and she knew it might not work. The traffickers could take her $20,000 and still not let Semhar go. Also, it was so much money. She'd raised money for causes before, but never that much.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:20:29.24" data-timestamp="1229.24">At the beginning, I didn't believe that someone should pay. And I thought that if the international community knows about it, they would just send soldiers or something and rescue them. That's the way I was thinking. But then you start realizing that you are on your own. Nobody will save these people. And one by one, they start dying. So I could not take the phone calls that when I called the next day, they would tell me, oh, he just died. And he just died.</p><p begin="00:20:56.52" data-timestamp="1256.52">So when five people died, that's when I decided, who cares if it's wrong or not? But I want to try, at least, to save one person so that I don't have a guilty feeling that I didn't try.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:21:12.53" data-timestamp="1272.53">So Meron began asking for money. She wrote posts on Facebook and used Paltalk, a social media voice chat where a lot of Eritreans hang out. At night, she went into different chat rooms, making her appeal. She got Eritrean ex-pats in the US, Norway, and the UK to collect money from people in their respective countries.</p><p begin="00:21:31.04" data-timestamp="1291.04">But donations came slowly-- $20 here, $50 there. People were reluctant to give money for a ransom payment, understandably. She also had to contend with the internal politics of the Eritrean diaspora. Meron's pretty well-known as a strong opponent of the Eritrean government, and there are still large groups of Eritreans in the diaspora that support the government. So they didn't trust Meron. Some claimed she and the hostages were making the whole situation up to make the government look bad.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:21:59.30" data-timestamp="1319.3">They were saying, it must be a made-up something like for radio, like a drama or something. They thought I made it up. So I said, well, if you don't believe me, here. Here is the number. You can call them yourself. That was really stupid of me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:22:14.71" data-timestamp="1334.71">It was stupid because people did take the hostages' phone number and started calling them, Biniam and the others, but not for the reason Meron had hoped.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:22:22.36" data-timestamp="1342.36">They started calling and cursing at them, saying, you think you can play us? You're not going to get anything, a cent out of us, and calling them names, and told the girl that she is a whore trying to make money out of Eritreans.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:22:39.83" data-timestamp="1359.83">On the phone afterwards, Biniam told Meron it really upset him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:22:43.58" data-timestamp="1363.58">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:22:46.90" data-timestamp="1366.9">They've been calling us all night.

Then I stopped counting. It became too much. Everybody started calling me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:26:03.40" data-timestamp="1563.4">At first, Meron was reluctant to get involved with other groups. But not surprisingly, she got drawn into their situations, as well. And as she spoke to more people, she was able to piece together a clearer picture of the criminal networks that were doing the trafficking. As best she could tell, a small group of Bedouin bosses in Sinai were at the top, but they had connections with gangs of kidnappers in Sudan, who would bring them truckloads of people. And they seemed to have agents in different cities around the world who would collect ransoms for them.</p><p begin="00:26:33.49" data-timestamp="1593.49">Meron also learned that there were Eritreans working for the traffickers in the encampments. Some of them were kind of like indentured servants, forced to do construction and cleaning jobs for the traffickers. Others were interpreters, Eritreans who spoke Arabic as well as Tigrinya and served as go-betweens for the Bedouins to help them communicate with the hostages and their families.</p><p begin="00:26:55.03" data-timestamp="1615.03">And in the first hostage group she was talking to, she learned that there was one interpreter in particular named John. She couldn't figure out his place in the hierarchy, whether he was a hostage forced to translate for the traffickers or if he'd actually joined their ring himself. A former hostage and a hostage's brother warned her that he was shady. But then when she asked Biniam and Semhar if John was working with the Bedouins, they told her he wasn't.</p><p begin="00:27:19.34" data-timestamp="1639.34">So in early April, when John came bearing good news, she didn't know if she could trust him. She had been asking the traffickers for weeks to lower the ransom, and John brought word that they'd agreed. The new price was $5,000 per person. At this point, Meron had already sent $2,000 for Semhar. So this meant she needed to send just $3,000 more, which was a lot more manageable than the original $20,000 price tag, if the discount was actually for real.</p><p begin="00:27:47.23" data-timestamp="1667.23">She called Biniam to see if it was.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:27:49.35" data-timestamp="1669.35">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:27:51.99" data-timestamp="1671.99">So if I pay $3,000 more, he'll let Semhar go, Meron asked Biniam. Yes, Biniam said. If you pay $3,000 more right now, he will let Semhar go. Meron was excited. This was her first break in the whole ordeal. But she soon found out it wasn't that simple.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:28:14.70" data-timestamp="1694.7">Yowei Shaw.

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:28:27.42" data-timestamp="1707.42">It's <i>This American</i> <i>Life</i>. I'm Ira Glass. Today's show, "This Call May Be Recorded to Save Your Life." We've been hearing a story that we first ran in 2013 about Meron Estefanos, a human rights activist and journalist who was trying to save a group of Eritrean hostages who were being held in Sinai.</p><p begin="00:28:43.21" data-timestamp="1723.21">In the years since we first aired this story, this problem has actually stopped in the Sinai Peninsula because of increased Egyptian military presence there. But it still continues elsewhere. According to Meron and human rights groups, Eritrean migrants are being held in torture camps and other places, particularly Libya. Meron says Libya is an even worse situation than Sinai was a few years ago.</p><p begin="00:29:03.64" data-timestamp="1743.64">At this point in our story, it's been over a month since her first phone call with the hostages, and she's been offered a discount, a break on the price to save one of them, the only woman in the group of 28. Her name was Semhar. Instead of a $20,000 ransom, it would be $5,000 to release her. Release means, in this case, they would drive her to the Israeli border and tell her to run for it.</p><p begin="00:29:26.38" data-timestamp="1766.38">Just to repeat the warning that I made at the beginning of the program, this is a story with violence and lives being threatened.

We were crying, both of us.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:44:12.37" data-timestamp="2652.37">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:44:13.83" data-timestamp="2653.83">Meron is actually everything for me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:44:16.10" data-timestamp="2656.1">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:44:21.60" data-timestamp="2661.6">With the voice I hear from her, I feel more than I feel for my mother's voice.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:44:27.65" data-timestamp="2667.65">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:44:29.33" data-timestamp="2669.33">I owe her my life.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:44:39.83" data-timestamp="2679.83">Biniam's name's doing pretty well, considering. He has a job as a housekeeper at a hotel. He's slowly trying to pay his family back the thousands they raised for his ransom. To unwind, he writes poetry and songs, though he hasn't written about Sinai yet.</p><p begin="00:44:55.26" data-timestamp="2695.26">But life in Israel is hard. Biniam still has injuries. He limps. His eyesight is impaired. He has trouble using his hands because he was chained for so long, which means his job making hotel beds is difficult. He applied for asylum when he arrived in Israel, but he says the government hasn't given him an answer on that. That means he gets no assistance with medical care, no legal work permit.</p><p begin="00:45:19.03" data-timestamp="2719.03">And he's not alone. This is, in practice, Israel's policy towards migrants. In the most recent figures available from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Israel granted refugee status to less than 1% of people who might qualify, the lowest rate of any developed country. A US State Department report declared in 2012 that the Israeli government doesn't even process asylum applications from Eritreans.</p><p begin="00:45:51.58" data-timestamp="2751.58">As best as we can tell, of the 29 hostages Biniam was originally held with, at least four died. One disappeared. One went back to Eritrea. And the rest, over 20 of them, are now in Israel. They try to get together when they can. Biniam says most of them are doing OK.</p><p begin="00:46:10.38" data-timestamp="2770.38">But you don't go through an experience like this and just move on. One last warning-- this next quote gets graphic. Here's Biniam.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:46:18.11" data-timestamp="2778.11">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:46:19.52" data-timestamp="2779.52">In my mind, I don't really get over it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:46:22.34" data-timestamp="2782.34">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:46:29.59" data-timestamp="2789.59">It's like every second, it's walking around with me.

I just open my eyes, and I see her, raping her. And I was praying for her to die.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:46:53.81" data-timestamp="2813.81">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:46:59.12" data-timestamp="2819.12">That's the time she was drived crazy, where she get lost, mental lost.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:47:04.75" data-timestamp="2824.75">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:47:07.91" data-timestamp="2827.91">And I really see that all the time, again and again.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:47:13.47" data-timestamp="2833.47">Biniam says Semhar's the person from his group who is doing the worst. She eventually made it to Israel, but only after an epic ordeal that went on long after Meron paid the $5,000 for her. She told Meron the whole story in an interview afterwards. Once the trafficker cut off Semhar from Meron and demanded $15,000 more, Semhar's mother in Eritrea, who is very poor, scraped together the money by begging people and taking loans. She sent it to the trafficker. Here's Meron.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:47:41.10" data-timestamp="2861.1">And then he tried to sell her to another house. And when he took her to another house, they said, call your mom. She said, no. Over my dead body. You can kill me, but she refused to call to her mother. They kept torturing her, torturing her, and she refused. She said, just kill me. I'm not calling anyone begging for more money.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:48:03.77" data-timestamp="2883.77">Finally, these new traffickers cut their losses and dropped Semhar near the Israeli border. They told her to climb the fence to get into Israel. Semhar was weak from months at the torture camp, and before she could get across the fence, Egyptian guards spotted her and shot her in the leg.</p><p begin="00:48:20.69" data-timestamp="2900.69">They took Semhar to a hospital in Egypt, where she got treatment. Eventually, Semhar told her story to a nurse, who felt sorry for her. The nurse brought Semhar home for a while and later paid a smuggler to take her to Israel, where she lives today.</p><p begin="00:48:34.80" data-timestamp="2914.8">Meron eventually went to visit her. Semhar still has injuries and pain, which make it hard for her to work. Plus, Meron says--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:48:42.29" data-timestamp="2922.29">She's now in a very bad situation where it's really hard to communicate. Mentally, she's not well. When we met, we hugged and we started crying, both of us. But suddenly, she just fainted as I was hugging her. And she fainted. And then subconsciously, she would get up and start screaming, you whore! Don't touch me. And she would hit anyone that's near her.</p><p begin="00:49:11.09" data-timestamp="2951.09">So it took about five, 10 minutes, and then after that, she woke up. And she was like, hi, Meron. How are you? I'm so happy to see you. And so she's talking like a normal thing, like nothing has happened. And she doesn't remember what she just had done.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:49:27.98" data-timestamp="2967.98">Meron tried to get Semhar to start seeing a doctor to help her deal with the trauma, but Semhar refused. She was living with a man in Tel Aviv who claimed to be a healer who could help exorcise her demons, and he wouldn't let her seek standard medical help. After Meron's trip to Israel, she pretty much lost touch with Semhar.</p><p begin="00:49:54.95" data-timestamp="2994.95">In July 2012, on a trip to Israel, Meron did something she'd been waiting to do since she first started talking to the hostages-- meet some of them face-to-face. She sent word to former hostages that anyone who wanted to meet her should come to Levinsky Park, a place in Tel Aviv where a lot of Eritreans go.</p><p begin="00:50:14.64" data-timestamp="3014.64">Meron got there in the early evening. A filmmaker was with her shooting video. She was excited, anxious.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:50:21.16" data-timestamp="3021.16">So we're going to meet them. Yeah.</p><p begin="00:50:24.30" data-timestamp="3024.3">And far away, I could see a lot of people sitting on the grass. I was expecting about five or six would come to see me. But there were so many of them.</p><p begin="00:50:35.73" data-timestamp="3035.73">They are here.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:50:36.66" data-timestamp="3036.66">What?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:50:37.27" data-timestamp="3037.27">These are the people. Hi. Hi.</p><p begin="00:50:43.28" data-timestamp="3043.28">Everybody stood up. I remember one of them came first and hugged me. And I just start crying.</p><p begin="00:50:52.59" data-timestamp="3052.59">Oh.</p><p begin="00:50:56.59" data-timestamp="3056.59">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p><p begin="00:50:57.82" data-timestamp="3057.82">Asking who are you, and he was saying, this person. And then the next person, the next person.</p><p begin="00:51:02.85" data-timestamp="3062.85">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:51:05.83" data-timestamp="3065.83">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:51:10.82" data-timestamp="3070.82">About 20 people stood in a circle around Meron. She went up to each of them, one by one, and hugged them. There was a man whose cousin Meron had convinced to pay his ransom. I'm so happy you guys made it out safely, Meron said to him as they hugged. I'm so happy that I've seen you alive.</p><p begin="00:51:27.96" data-timestamp="3087.96">Another was a 14-year-old girl whose ransom Meron had paid with money she raised herself. The girl broke down in tears as soon as Meron got close to her.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:51:36.16" data-timestamp="3096.16">Oh, my God. Oh. [SPEAKING TIGRINYA].</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:51:52.68" data-timestamp="3112.68">The group headed to a restaurant. Meron bought a round of beers. She seemed giddy. She was talking a lot, way more than the hostages, telling stories about this phone call or that phone call, about the time people thought the hostages were lying and making up a radio drama, or about the time she told John the translator off.</p><p begin="00:52:15.43" data-timestamp="3135.43">This is Meron's life now. She still covers the torture camps on the radio. She helps other reporters do stories, too, speaks about Sinai at conferences. And she used her recordings to co-author a lengthy report that was submitted to the European Union Parliament. A few months ago, she even went to Sinai for the first time to try and get local sheikhs to address the hostage problem.</p><p begin="00:52:38.33" data-timestamp="3158.33">And then, of course, she still gets phone calls from hostages and their families all the time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:52:44.17" data-timestamp="3164.17">My life has changed totally. I don't know how to lead a normal life right now because I feel bad if I'm laughing. I feel bad if I'm going out. Sometimes, they would make a missed call while I'm eating my dinner. I tried to talk to them while I'm eating. But I try to chew like as slow as I can so that they don't notice that I'm eating because I would feel bad that I'm eating and they don't have anything to eat.</p><p begin="00:53:08.12" data-timestamp="3188.12">I mean, that has become my life. This has become my call for life, actually. I just feel that this was meant for me, and this is my call. I see it as part of my life, stopping this. I see them as my family.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:53:32.28" data-timestamp="3212.28">When was the last time you talked to a hostage?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:53:37.61" data-timestamp="3217.61">Yeah, last night, around midnight.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:50.87" data-timestamp="3230.87">Yowei Shaw. Brian Reed produced her story. As I mentioned earlier, since we first reported this story in 2013, the Egyptian military increased its presence in the Sinai, putting a stop to the Bedouin torture camps there. But people are still fleeing Eritrea in large numbers. They're paying smugglers to take them to the Mediterranean for a shot at getting on a boat to Europe.</p><p begin="00:54:11.71" data-timestamp="3251.71">And just like in the Sinai, these smugglers often take Eritreans hostage and torture them, trying to extort money from their families. Meron says she gets more calls from hostages now than she ever has.</p><p begin="00:54:22.87" data-timestamp="3262.87">And a new danger has emerged in the last few years. Even if you manage to avoid a bad smuggler, there's a chance that you could get caught by ISIS on your way to Europe. And unlike the smugglers or the Bedouins in Sinai, they're not interested in money. They try to get the hostages to join ISIS. And if they refuse, they kill them.</p><p begin="00:54:43.05" data-timestamp="3283.05">As for the situation in Israel, according to the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, which works with migrants there, there are roughly 30,000 Eritrean migrants living in Israel who made it through the Sinai. But as of last year, the state has still only recognized fewer than 1% of Eritrean asylum applicants, according to the UN, leaving thousands of Eritreans in a holding pattern, including Biniam, who's still in Israel. Meron tells us he's now married.</p><p begin="00:55:09.01" data-timestamp="3309.01">Semhar eventually got out of Israel. She's now living in Sweden, not far from Meron, actually. Meron says she's taking classes. She's doing better mentally. She recently got married. Semhar invited Meron to the wedding. Meron says it was the best day she's had since the calls began.</p><p begin="00:55:35.56" data-timestamp="3335.56">[MUSIC - "IF YOU CALL" BY SHARON JONES AND THE DAP KINGS]</p><p begin="00:55:39.04" data-timestamp="3339.04"></p><p begin="00:56:15.13" data-timestamp="3375.13">Well, our program was produced today by Lisa Pollak.
