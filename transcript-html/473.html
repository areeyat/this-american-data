  <h3>Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.37" data-timestamp="0.37"> Well, it's just like they say in <i>Us Weekly,</i> people in the 18th century, they're just like us. At least they are when they're not in situations like the one I'm about to describe to you. It's 1761, Austria, cue the Mozart music, which, by an act of Congress in 1974, is required in any Public Radio story like this. Mozart, please.</p><p begin="00:00:20.52" data-timestamp="20.52">[MUSIC PLAYING]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:00:22.86" data-timestamp="22.86">Ava Litzelfelnerin gets married. She's 25, moves from her parents' farm to her husband's farm 16 miles away, which back then seemed really, really far away.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kathy Stuart</h4><p begin="00:00:33.97" data-timestamp="33.97">She feels like she's in a foreign country when she's moved these 16 miles to the new village. And she says things like, oh, I don't know what the local customs are here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:43.96" data-timestamp="43.96">That's Kathy Stuart, a professor of history at the University of California Davis. She says that from hundreds of pages of archived criminal testimony, we know that this was an arranged marriage, that Ava met her husband days before the wedding, and that Ava's new mother-in-law dominated the household, wouldn't even let Ava give gifts to the neighbors when she moved in. The mother-in-law gave the field hands smaller portions of food than Ava thought was right, and she wouldn't let Ava change it or take charge. Ava tells people how unhappy she is in this new life far from the life she'd known.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kathy Stuart</h4><p begin="00:01:13.71" data-timestamp="73.71">She is constantly articulating to her husband, her brother, her mother that she wants to leave this world, and she can find no happiness in this world. And the only response she gets is go home and pray and work.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:36.52" data-timestamp="96.52">So she decides to end her life, but there's a problem. At the time, suicide was considered a worse sin than murder. Kathy Stuart says the logic was, if you committed a murder, you could confess your sin, and if you were truly repentant, you could get yourself into Heaven. Obviously, if you kill yourself, you don't get that chance, and you are doomed to eternal damnation. And Ava did not want to go to Hell, but she thought of a loophole-- a morbid, little loophole.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kathy Stuart</h4><p begin="00:02:07.01" data-timestamp="127.01">She thought, OK, wait a minute. What if I commit suicide in a way that is really slow and secret. And I can get myself to a priest on time to confess before I die, and then nobody need know that I committed suicide, and I'll get to Heaven anyway. So what she does is, she goes to a nearby town, and she goes from store to store trying to buy arsenic.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:31.81" data-timestamp="151.81">She testifies later this turns out to be really, really hard. Arsenic is a controlled substance. Nobody wants to sell it to her. Finally, she makes up a story about working for a farmer who has a rodent problem, which works.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kathy Stuart</h4><p begin="00:02:44.81" data-timestamp="164.81">And then she goes home and she takes the arsenic. But she takes apparently just a little bit of arsenic, the way she describes it, as much as you could get on the point of a butter knife.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:57.08" data-timestamp="177.08">It's delicate, right? She wants to take enough arsenic that it'll kill her, but not so much that it'll kill her quickly. She needs time to get to a priest first to confess the sin.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kathy Stuart</h4><p begin="00:03:09.03" data-timestamp="189.03">So she takes this little bit of arsenic. But apparently it was enough to make her violently ill, and for a week, every time she ate, she vomited. But it wasn't enough to make her think that she was now going to die.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:24.48" data-timestamp="204.48">So she never goes to the priest. Figuring out the proper dosage, she testifies later, is just a vexing problem that she doesn't know how to solve. And she gives up that plan, which brings her to a much more disturbing plan. She decides to do something that, to us, to our modern sensibility, is so much worse than killing yourself. From our point of view, she decides to do one of the worst things a person could possibly do.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kathy Stuart</h4><p begin="00:03:47.90" data-timestamp="227.9">She decides, I'm going to murder a child.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:51.64" data-timestamp="231.64">That's right. She's going to murder a child to help herself get into Heaven. And incredibly, Kathy Stuart says this was a common strategy around that time for people who wanted to kill themselves. She came across a case like this and then went looking for others like it. And now she has found around 300, most of them women.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kathy Stuart</h4><p begin="00:04:10.27" data-timestamp="250.27">These people don't want to go to Hell. So the option that they choose is to commit a capital crime. Immediately upon committing the crime, they run to the court. They confess what they have done, and they essentially demand their own execution.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:28.09" data-timestamp="268.09">So they demand execution knowing that before they go to the gallows, they will have a chance to confess. And if they're truly repentant, they'll go to Heaven. And why kill a child?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kathy Stuart</h4><p begin="00:04:39.65" data-timestamp="279.65">They kill a child because the child is seen as being in a state of innocence. So you might possibly be doing the child a favor, because the child will also go to Heaven. You will go to Heaven. It's kind of a win-win situation. There's a happy ending for all.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:06.94" data-timestamp="306.94">Yes, the classic happy ending. An innocent child gets an untimely death. Ava has to try this twice before she succeeds. The first time, she pushes a boy, who is described as being tall as a chair, into a river. But then someone spots them, and it seems like that person might rescue the boy. And so she decides, well, she should just rescue the boy herself. And then the boy ends up running away, and it doesn't work out.</p><p begin="00:05:29.78" data-timestamp="329.78">The second time, she wanders to a nearby village called Traun, which has a little waterfall. She walks by a house, notices some baby clothes on a clothesline. Ava steals the baby, who is this couple's only child. The woman's 37. The man is 58. Ava throws the baby into the river and then turns herself in. Later, interestingly, when she's interrogated, she never actually seems too regretful about what she has done to this other family.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kathy Stuart</h4><p begin="00:06:01.02" data-timestamp="361.02">Just before her ultimate condemnation, in the last interrogation the interrogator asks her, is there anything else you want to say? Is there any regret you want to express? And again, she expresses regret for the distress and dishonor that she has caused her husband and her family. But she never even mentions the child or the child's parents. And I thought that was quite striking.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:28.72" data-timestamp="388.72">Well, she's not sorry.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kathy Stuart</h4><p begin="00:06:30.94" data-timestamp="390.94">No, she's not sorry, one might say.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:34.17" data-timestamp="394.17">So she's not going to Heaven, right? She's not sorry for the murder. This whole plan of hers is not going to work.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kathy Stuart</h4><p begin="00:06:41.48" data-timestamp="401.48">Well, the pastor will say to the person being executed, do you think God can be fooled in this manner? You know that by doing this, you actually have committed suicide and so forth. And so the pastors really do address that theological problem, that this is a loophole. You're trying to cheat God. But because they have enough time, the condemned criminal can say, oh, yes, I was trying to cheat God. I was trying to commit suicide, and I repent. So confession takes care of it all.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:16.81" data-timestamp="436.81">It doesn't seem fair.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kathy Stuart</h4><p begin="00:07:18.43" data-timestamp="438.43">No, it really doesn't.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:27.90" data-timestamp="447.9">Kathy Stuart says these kinds of suicides, suicides by proxy, she calls them, started in the mid 1600s. By 1700, officials in European cities were starting to notice this new trend of people murdering children so that they would get executed. And the officials tried to adjust the laws to stop it. In 1702, officials in Nuremberg made the execution more painful and shameful for these cases. It didn't work.</p><p begin="00:07:53.27" data-timestamp="473.27">In 1767, they finally do the only logical thing to close this loophole. People are killing children because they want to get the death penalty. OK, they remove the death penalty for this kind of case. That didn't work either.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kathy Stuart</h4><p begin="00:08:08.17" data-timestamp="488.17">Cases keep happening until the early decades of the 19th century. So it really seems like people didn't get the memo. It probably dissuaded some people, but people keep doing it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:21.70" data-timestamp="501.7">Today on our show, we have a story about this cat-and-mouse game where rules are set, and someone tries to bend around the rules to get what they want.</p><p begin="00:08:30.10" data-timestamp="510.1">As any parent knows, starting pretty much as soon as a child is able to understand the fact that rules exist-- you know, don't touch the stove; don't put that in your nose-- they start to test the boundaries of the rule, to poke at it, to look for loopholes.</p><p begin="00:08:47.00" data-timestamp="527">Today we have the story of somebody who takes pleasure in doing just that. He takes pleasure in the ingenuity of it, of finding a loophole that nobody else has noticed, and exploiting it as long as he can until the authorities notice him.</p><p begin="00:08:59.79" data-timestamp="539.79">From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life,</i> distributed by Public Radio International.

  <h3>Act One: Death Takes a Policy</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:14.64" data-timestamp="554.64">Act One, Death Takes a Policy.</p><p begin="00:09:17.44" data-timestamp="557.44">Joseph Caramadre is a wealthy philanthropist and a devout Catholic. In his huge house in the Providence suburbs, he has a near-life-size statue of Saint Joseph displayed in its own alcove in the living room. He's given millions of dollars to charities, especially the Catholic Church.</p><p begin="00:09:32.40" data-timestamp="572.4">In 2009, the local United Way gave him one of its highest individual honors-- the Tocqueville Society Philanthropy Award-- for his work on behalf of more than 40 different charities. Joseph Caramadre is also, depending on who you talk to, either a criminal mastermind, or just a regular, law-abiding guy, who managed to take advantage of loopholes to turn the tables on some of the largest corporations in the country and beat them at their own game.</p><p begin="00:09:58.90" data-timestamp="598.9">Jake Bernstein from ProPublica teams up with Alex Blumberg from our own Planet Money team to tell the story.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:10:05.81" data-timestamp="605.81">Before the criminal indictment, before the lawsuits, before the exposes on the local news, Joseph Caramadre had a prosperous business doing estate planning. He helped rich people prepare for their deaths, everything from taxes to life insurance.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:10:19.30" data-timestamp="619.3">To give you a sense of what kind of guy he is, what makes him so good at this job, consider this story. He was at a local office superstore, and they were selling calendars with coupons on each page. He saw one of these coupon to that said $25 off any piece of office furniture. He read the fine print and realized the lawyers who wrote the language in that coupon had forgotten a key clause.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joseph Caramadre</h4><p begin="00:10:38.43" data-timestamp="638.43">I noticed that mistake there. It was normal for me to notice it. I'm kind of hard wired for this.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:10:45.70" data-timestamp="645.7">Wait. What was the mistake?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joseph Caramadre</h4><p begin="00:10:46.69" data-timestamp="646.69"> The mistake was that they meant $25 off of any piece of furniture over $200. They forgot the over $200 part. So all the coupons were issued $25 off of any piece of furniture.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:11:06.72" data-timestamp="666.72">And there was lots of furniture that was less than $25?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joseph Caramadre</h4><p begin="00:11:09.59" data-timestamp="669.59">It was even worse than that. There was stuff $40 on sale for $25.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Jakebernstein</h4><p begin="00:11:15.58" data-timestamp="675.58">Caramadre bought all the calendars he could. He bought so many of them, he says, they gave him a discount. And when that month for that $25 off coupon rolled around, he showed up at the store, and bought every piece of furniture under $25 he could find.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joseph Caramadre</h4><p begin="00:11:30.00" data-timestamp="690">And they rang it up. All right, it's $1200. And I just pull out a stack of coupons and say, all right, we're even. And the face on the managers-- the expression on the poor manager's face was such that the poor guy said I'm going to lose my job. I said it's not your fault that Legal doesn't know what the hell they're doing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:11:57.11" data-timestamp="717.11">Who does this? Think of the effort involved. He had to read through 12 months of the fine print, buy all those calendars, remember the scheme, and come back several months later to claim his prize. And for what? $1,200 of cheap office furniture that he didn't even need. He actually had to borrow a truck from a friend to take it all home, where he says he stored some of it in his garage and gave some to friends, family, and charity.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:12:20.15" data-timestamp="740.15">Joseph Caramadre has a compulsion for loopholes, for seeing the angle in a deal and exploiting it. In fact, when he discovers schemes like this, he calls them his creations. He actually numbers them. There have been 19 of them in his lifetime, he says. The office furniture one was number four. And it is number 18 we're talking about today, the one that first landed him in trouble.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:12:44.10" data-timestamp="764.1">The seeds of number 18 came in the mid 1990s, in a place most of us would probably consider more likely to put us to sleep than spark an idea.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joseph Caramadre</h4><p begin="00:12:51.20" data-timestamp="771.2">One of the insurance companies was giving a seminar to agents, which I am a life insurance agent, where they were espousing the benefits of their variable annuities.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:13:03.81" data-timestamp="783.81">So Jake.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:13:04.86" data-timestamp="784.86">Alex.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:13:05.96" data-timestamp="785.96">This is the part of the story where we have to explain what a variable annuity is.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:13:09.39" data-timestamp="789.39">Yeah, but don't worry. It's not that complex. The variable annuity was a product that was just becoming popular around the time Joe went to the seminar. And though they were sold by life insurance companies, they were very different from a traditional life insurance policy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:13:24.10" data-timestamp="804.1">A life insurance policy, you pay a little bit of money each year and, if you die, your beneficiaries, your spouse, your kids, will get a big payout.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:13:32.39" data-timestamp="812.39">Variable annuities are more like an investment. You have, say, a million dollars, and you purchase an annuity, which is then invested in a variety of different funds that you select-- mutual funds, stocks, bonds. The insurance companies give you an array of choices, and you tell them which funds get the money.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:13:49.76" data-timestamp="829.76">This is the variable part of the equation. Now, you might be wondering, why not just put the money in a mutual fund yourself? Why go through the insurance company at all? Well, one of the main reasons, the insurance company has offered something called a death benefit guarantee.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:14:05.76" data-timestamp="845.76">With the death benefit guarantee, say you invest a million dollars, but the market crashes, and so does your investment. If you should die before the investment recovers, your beneficiary gets the original million, even if the account is worth half of that. You get all the upside without the downside.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:14:24.46" data-timestamp="864.46">All upside, no downside. This is the Holy Grail for any investor. Most investment managers will tell you it's impossible. You can't get reward without risk. Yet here it was, sitting before Caramadre, the proverbial free lunch-- with one very big catch.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joseph Caramadre</h4><p begin="00:14:41.10" data-timestamp="881.1">That's really not a free lunch. I have to die.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:14:50.83" data-timestamp="890.83">To most of us, that having to die part, that would be a deal breaker, a sign to walk away. But to Caramadre, he could tell there was a creation in here somewhere, he just needed to find the loophole.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joseph Caramadre</h4><p begin="00:15:02.79" data-timestamp="902.79">All we need to do is replace the necessity of the investor having to die with someone else dying. So if we could transfer and get a substitute life, we've effectively accomplished the investor not needing to die.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:15:21.36" data-timestamp="921.36">Joe started reading through prospectuses, the 100-page documents filled with legalese that explain the rules of each annuity plan. Lots of companies offered these annuities, Transamerica-- ING, MetLife, Nationwide. And it turns out, the way these variable annuity contracts were written, there was a loophole.</p><p begin="00:15:40.13" data-timestamp="940.13">Every annuity has three participants. There's the investor. That's the person who's putting up the million dollars, say. There's the beneficiary, the person who gets the money if the death benefit is triggered. And then there's a third party called an annuitant, or what's known as a measuring life.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:15:56.44" data-timestamp="956.44">And this third category, that annuitant person, that's where the loophole was found. The way the insurance companies intended it to work, the way it worked most of the time, was that the investor and the annuitant were the same person.</p><p begin="00:16:13.46" data-timestamp="973.46">For example, I, Jake Bernstein, put up a million dollars to purchase an annuity. And if I, Jake Bernstein, die, then the death benefit gets triggered. I'm the investor. I'm also the annuitant. The beneficiary would usually be a family member.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:16:29.95" data-timestamp="989.95">But Caramadre discovered legally you could set it up a different way. There was no requirement in the contracts that the annuitant be the investor. In fact, there was no requirement that the annuitant have any relationship to the investor at all. So in theory, I, Alex Blumberg, could put up a million dollars, but I could find someone else, my ailing grandmother or a perfect stranger, to be the annuitant, to be the person whose demise triggers the death benefit.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joseph Caramadre</h4><p begin="00:16:56.77" data-timestamp="1016.77">If you can get a short life expectancy, you will be able to have your cake and eat it. You'll be able to invest any way you want to in these mutual funds and know it's like going to the horses. When you leave the horse track, if you won, you keep the winnings. If you lose, they give you your money back.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:17:20.70" data-timestamp="1040.7">Now, there are laws against using insurance to profit from the deaths of strangers. You don't want people taking out an insurance contract on the neighbor down the street and then killing them. But according to a Rhode Island federal court, an annuity is fundamentally different than life insurance. So those laws about insuring strangers, they don't apply.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:17:39.75" data-timestamp="1059.75">Which meant Caramadre's creation was almost complete. But before he brought it to his clients, he needed to test it, so he decided to buy one himself. He started small, an annuity for just $10,000. He was the investor. His wife Paula was the beneficiary. All he needed was an annuitant who might not be around for long.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joseph Caramadre</h4><p begin="00:17:59.52" data-timestamp="1079.52">In this case, it was a friend of the family I knew that our family in church was praying for because they had cancer, and I was helping to straighten out the estate of the family. So I happened to know the person and just asked them, can I use them as a measuring life.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:18:17.19" data-timestamp="1097.19">Was that-- were you nervous to first have that conversation?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joseph Caramadre</h4><p begin="00:18:21.88" data-timestamp="1101.88">Yeah, I would say I was a little bit nervous, because we're talking about someone dying, and no one wants to talk about death. I think a lot of my success in the life insurance industry has been because I always treat death as a part of life, and it's very easy for me to talk about it. I'm around death all the time. Estate planning is all about death planning.</p><p begin="00:18:44.10" data-timestamp="1124.1">So, for me, it was-- basically, I guess I might have been the first one to ever ask anyone, can we use their name and their health status for the benefit of others. Yes, I was a little nervous, but then, on the other hand, if the person didn't want to do it, they didn't have to do it. This was an opportunity for me to test something. And if it worked, then I could bring it into more of a multiple use.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:19:14.52" data-timestamp="1154.52">And it was also an opportunity for the annuitant, who was very sick and maybe struggling financially, to get some money. Caramadre says he initially paid this family friend around $500 for his signature and permission to use his name, date of birth, and social security number on the annuity form.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:19:31.12" data-timestamp="1171.12">Now, a lot of people might find this gross, taking a person's most vulnerable, emotional moment and turning it into an opportunity for financial gain. But on the other hand, this isn't trying to upsell a grieving family on a super deluxe casket. Sure, Caramadre and his clients were going to benefit. But Caramadre was giving this man and his family money, not taking money from them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:19:59.00" data-timestamp="1199">On the application, the insurance companies only asked one question that touched on what Caramadre was planning to do. That single question? What is the relationship between the investor and the annuitant.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joseph Caramadre</h4><p begin="00:20:10.82" data-timestamp="1210.82">I put N-O-N-E, none. No relationship.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:20:14.85" data-timestamp="1214.85">But they don't ask how healthy is he? They don't say, is he in a hospital?

None of that stuff.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joseph Caramadre</h4><p begin="00:20:20.69" data-timestamp="1220.69">No, not at all.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:20:22.73" data-timestamp="1222.73">Within a few months, Caramadre's first annuitant died. Caramadre paid his respects to this family and submitted the death claim. His account had lost money. The original $10,000 investment was down to about $9,000. But the insurance company paid him his original investment plus interest, no questions asked. And I emphasize, no questions.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:20:43.13" data-timestamp="1243.13">Did they say anything to you when you put in the claim after only four months, or three months, or whatever it was?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joseph Caramadre</h4><p begin="00:20:51.54" data-timestamp="1251.54">No. And let me make it a little bit more interesting. Right after that, we submitted four applications to the same company with four different investor owners using the same measuring life.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:21:10.72" data-timestamp="1270.72">So they found one dying person and filled out four different applications with four different investors all using the same guy as the annuitant. When that person died?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joseph Caramadre</h4><p begin="00:21:21.35" data-timestamp="1281.35">I actually sent in one piece of paper saying this person died, pay these four owners. And they said nothing. So they had--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:21:31.86" data-timestamp="1291.86">And they paid it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joseph Caramadre</h4><p begin="00:21:32.68" data-timestamp="1292.68">Yeah, they paid it and processed it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:21:39.41" data-timestamp="1299.41">The insurance companies paid and processed it because the insurance companies made a lot of money. Remember the way this usually works. You put in your million dollars, and the life insurance company can collect upwards of 4% of that money in fees every year, potentially for decades. The way the insurance company saw it, these annuities were money makers. They didn't need to ask that many questions.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:22:01.08" data-timestamp="1321.08">For Caramadre, though, it meant creation number 18 was fully operational. He'd found the loophole that made the free lunch possible.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joseph Caramadre</h4><p begin="00:22:17.38" data-timestamp="1337.38">OK, so now I have a creation on hand that has been tested at least preliminarily with a little bit of money. It has been tested that the company doesn't seem to care or want to care about underwriting, health questions, relationship, or even losses or gains. So I now start going to clients that are near and dear to me and tell them look, I think I have something special here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Ferreira</h4><p begin="00:22:46.26" data-timestamp="1366.26">My name's Carl Ferreira.

How many times had we dealt with insurance companies and been denied claims, whether it's on your homeowner's, or your medical insurance, or your dental insurance, and they refer you to some policy in fine print. And you say to yourself, you need a lawyer to read this.</p><p begin="00:24:05.29" data-timestamp="1445.29">And I said isn't this great?

It was never a big part of his overall business, he says. He puts it less than 5% of what he made. But among a certain type of person, getting in on creation number 18 became something like a trophy investment, something to brag about.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joseph Caramadre</h4><p begin="00:25:49.58" data-timestamp="1549.58">If there's a couple of people who are captains of industry at a country club, they're always boasting that their investment adviser got them this, and their car is the best, and all this. Their doctor's the best. So it actually got to the point where, if I wanted to, I could have a waiting list of people to beg me to take a million dollars. People wanted a piece of this, if they could hear about it, and if I would allow them in the game, if you will.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:26:21.03" data-timestamp="1581.03">Caramadre made money on this scheme in a variety of ways. Sometimes, he simply collected a fee. The insurance companies had these annuities they were trying to sell, and they paid the people who helped sell them a small percentage. Caramadre would take a cut of that percentage. On a few occasions, he says, he split some of the profit with the client.</p><p begin="00:26:37.46" data-timestamp="1597.46">He would say to one of these captains of industry, I have this great opportunity for you. Give me a cut of whatever your investment makes. And sometimes, he would invest his own money in an annuity. Caramadre's lawyers have told him not to say exactly how much he made off of this scheme, but it was likely in the millions of dollars. Regardless, as he did more and more of these deals, he needed more and more people who were close to death.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joseph Caramadre</h4><p begin="00:26:59.63" data-timestamp="1619.63">I started asking doctors, nursing homes, hospices, organizations, funeral homes, social workers if they knew of anyone who is terminally ill and needed money.

Some of these were also used in a slightly different scheme, creation number 19, which involved bonds, but was a close cousin of the variable annuity program.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:27:57.34" data-timestamp="1677.34">Most of the participants in these schemes have died by now. We found two annuitants who are still alive, but they declined to talk to us. But we do have video testimony of several of these annuitants taken before they died. In this video, Charles Buckman has an oxygen tube going into his nose. He suffers from a chronic lung condition. He's also hard of hearing. He says he first got involved with creation number 18 in 2008. It started with his wife.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charles Buckman</h4><p begin="00:28:24.67" data-timestamp="1704.67">It started, my wife, she had cancer, and she was critical with cancer. And we had a visiting nurse who came two or three days a week, and she mentioned to my wife, she showed us a flyer and wanted to know if we ever got our $2,000. My wife said, what are you talking about? We had no idea. So she gave us the flyer. She said please call this number. So I did.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:28:52.85" data-timestamp="1732.85">By 2008 when Buckman got involved, Caramadre had taken out an ad in a local Catholic newspaper which said-- Terminal illness? $2000. And then all in capital letters-- IN CASH, immediately available.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:29:06.94" data-timestamp="1746.94">And the way it worked, everyone who answered the ad and could prove they had a terminal illness got a check for $2,000, whether they participated in Caramadre's program or not. If they decided to sign the documents and serve as a measuring life, there was more money available, usually between $3,000 and $10,000.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:29:23.10" data-timestamp="1763.1">Caramadre had a young employee right out of college named Raymour Radhakrishnan, who was signing up most of the annuitants, including Charles Buckman.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charles Buckman</h4><p begin="00:29:32.57" data-timestamp="1772.57">He stopped in, and he visited with us.

Mr. Buckman says Raymour read him the documents and explained that there's a group of people making an investment, and these people could make money if someone dies. He says he knew that he and his wife wouldn't get any of that money. Their only payouts were the checks they would collect for signing these documents.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:30:35.10" data-timestamp="1835.1">Buckman and his wife ended up signing papers on nine transactions. Caramadre says he paid the couple a total of $12,000. To Buckman, it was a great deal. He said so to Raymour.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charles Buckman</h4><p begin="00:30:47.07" data-timestamp="1847.07">What I told Raymour was, my wife-- I can't thank him enough.

Her mom made around $20,000, according to Caramadre.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Speaker</h4><p begin="00:31:40.01" data-timestamp="1900.01">What he gave my mom-- at the time, she had been sickly, and financially, as most people in her age group, things like prescriptions were becoming a stretch to afford. She couldn't buy Christmas presents for her grandchildren and her great grandchildren. And there were certain things that she needed, whether it be hair color or to go to Wright's Chicken Farm with the elderly and whatnot. She didn't have her own money for that, so she relied on us for that, and that bothered her. [SOFT CRYING]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:32:20.89" data-timestamp="1940.89">I'm sorry.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Speaker</h4><p begin="00:32:21.82" data-timestamp="1941.82">I did good until now. But working with Joe, the compensation he gave her gave her back her dignity. She would go to the mall with my granddaughter and I, and when I said no to a Webkinz, my mom could say, I can do this. And that made her-- that's what gave my mom happiness, really.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:32:57.47" data-timestamp="1977.47">Throughout the mid to late 2000s, Caramadre increased the number of deals he did, as he took advantage of something people in the life insurance business now call the arms race. To an insurance company, a variable annuity seemed like a great deal. You get this big chunk of cash. It's locked up and delivers a great stream of money from fee income.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:33:17.69" data-timestamp="1997.69">And so insurance companies competed with each other for the business of customers like Joe Caramadre by offering more and more enticements in their variable annuity packages.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joseph Caramadre</h4><p begin="00:33:26.72" data-timestamp="2006.72">As companies figured out in the early 2000s that this was a great profitable situation, their only goal was to accumulate assets. So they started with deposit bonuses. I give them $1 million. They put $50,000 or $60,000 right in my account, day one. So I earn 6% the day I buy this.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:33:49.09" data-timestamp="2029.09">In other words, life insurance companies literally paid people to buy these products. But wait, there's more. They also provided increasingly exotic investment options for where you could put your money.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joseph Caramadre</h4><p begin="00:34:05.25" data-timestamp="2045.25">Double beta funds, inverse funds. You could bet the Japanese yen, the Mexican peso. You can bet the Saudi Arabian nuclear fund. I'm making a joke there, but there were funds that I never even heard of.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:34:19.57" data-timestamp="2059.57">And these are all riskier and riskier funds but that offered potentially greater and greater returns?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joseph Caramadre</h4><p begin="00:34:24.23" data-timestamp="2064.23">Yes. And we did not pick very stable, secure funds, government bond funds, which we knew would not have much risk or much reward. I'm going to pick the most aggressive fund known to man that is available in that variable annuity portfolio.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:34:46.55" data-timestamp="2086.55">Companies piled on more bells and whistles with fancy names, rising floors, earning enhancements, bonus credits, ratchets. For Caramadre and his team, they watched each new enticement, each new bell and whistle, each new escalation in the arms race with glee and amazement. One broker I talked to said perusing the latest prospectuses and picking the best benefits for their clients was like ordering off a Friendly's menu.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joseph Caramadre</h4><p begin="00:35:16.10" data-timestamp="2116.1">Every month or so, my firm would come out with the top 10 lucrative variable annuities.

But the eagerness to increase sales always carried the day.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:35:57.84" data-timestamp="2157.84">Plus, the insurance companies thought they would hardly ever have to pay out these death benefits.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:36:03.18" data-timestamp="2163.18">And also remember, throughout much of the 2000s, the market was doing pretty well, so chances were your account would be worth more than the death benefit anyway. That all changed with the financial crisis. The initial investments had lost money, but the insurance companies were still on the hook to pay that initial investment. So those death claims started to matter to the companies a lot more. And a few noticed that they were getting more claims than mathematical models predicted they would.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Flanders</h4><p begin="00:36:31.53" data-timestamp="2191.53">Apparently, they had done some sort of a map of where all these claims were coming from, and there were a lot of red dots around Cranston, which is where Joe was operating out of.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:36:43.60" data-timestamp="2203.6">This is Robert Flanders, a former Rhode Island state Supreme Court Justice, now in private practice, who served as Caramadre's attorney when the insurance companies started suing him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:36:53.34" data-timestamp="2213.34">Flanders represents Caramadre in cases brought by two life insurance companies, both owned by the same conglomerate.

Try and take out a life insurance policy and try and skate by the insurance company when you've got some medical condition. The fact is, they didn't really care about it, and that's reflected in the fact that they didn't ask any of those questions. They didn't want to.</p><p begin="00:37:29.85" data-timestamp="2249.85">But what happened here is Caramadre turned this into a business. And it was OK, I guess, when he was doing it for friends and family and making occasional scores along the way. But when they started plotting out all the claims and saw that this guy was actually coordinating a voluminous submission of claims, and then as they dug a little deeper and found out that he had actually placed ads in the newspaper advertising for terminally ill patients, they just, I think, finally threw up their hands and said we've got to stop this somehow, some way. We're getting taken to the cleaners here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:38:07.30" data-timestamp="2287.3">Of course, Flanders is quick to point out they could've stopped it themselves any time they wanted to.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Flanders</h4><p begin="00:38:11.94" data-timestamp="2291.94">All they had to do was change their applications or preclude this in their contracts, change the forms. These are the lords of the forms, these folks. All they had to do was put something in there, ask the right questions, or preclude terminally ill patients from participating as annuitants, and it would've stopped it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:38:34.07" data-timestamp="2314.07">To date, there have been at least eight civil court cases filed against Caramadre or his investors. So far, a federal judge in Rhode Island has largely sided with Caramadre.

But the I-Team has learned he's also the target of a federal grand jury criminal investigation.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:40:31.98" data-timestamp="2431.98">Soon after learning of the investigation, Caramadre and his lawyer, Robert Flanders, requested a meeting with the prosecutors.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Flanders</h4><p begin="00:40:38.30" data-timestamp="2438.3">We met with US Attorney's Office early on and tried to persuade them that this was a civil matter at best and not something they should be having any interest in. But they were morally outraged, the lawyers were for the government, that Caramadre, in their opinion, had taken advantage of poor, old, sick people.</p><p begin="00:41:00.11" data-timestamp="2460.11">That he was a guy who was just throwing a few shekels at some poor, sick people at the end of their lives, and he was reaping the lion's share of it. And they didn't like the stink or the smell of it, and they didn't like what they considered the inequity of it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:41:16.85" data-timestamp="2476.85">Over a period of two years, a grand jury investigated Caramadre's scheme, and the FBI fanned out and interviewed witnesses. Hospice workers, investors, family members of annuitants, like Stephanie Porter.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stephanie Porter</h4><p begin="00:41:29.39" data-timestamp="2489.39">I came home one day and found a card in the door from the FBI that said call me. And my husband came home that day from work, and I looked at him. I was laughing, and I said the FBI was here. He was like, what? I said, OK, what did you do? He goes, well, I was going to ask you the same thing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:41:49.47" data-timestamp="2509.47">Stephanie Porter's mom, Bertha Howard, had received the same visit from Raymour Radhakrishnan that Charlie Buckman and his wife had gotten. Radhakrishnan had shown up with a check for $2,000, and they'd agreed he'd come back later with papers to sign and more money. But by the time Radhakrishnan made it back for a second visit with the documents ready to go, Stephanie's mom was close to death.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stephanie Porter</h4><p begin="00:42:13.30" data-timestamp="2533.3">If she tried to sign her name, she'd sign instead of signing Bertha, she'd sign B-B-B-B-, then E-R-T-H-A. She tried to sign Bertha D, and it was Bertha D-D-D-D-D. So he said, you know, just do it to the best of your ability. And he said, I'm going to take the paperwork with me. We'll see what happens, and I'll be in touch.</p><p begin="00:42:35.47" data-timestamp="2555.47">And then it just so happened that the next time he called me, he said, I just called to let you know that the company wouldn't accept your mom's papers because of all the inconsistencies in her writing. And I said, I fully understand. It was too far advanced by then. I said, but at the same time, I said, my mom passed away. And I think she had been gone a few days.</p><p begin="00:42:58.69" data-timestamp="2578.69">And it was, I'm very, very sorry. What could I say but don't be sorry. I can't thank you enough for what you did for my mom and did for us. And that was the end of story, never heard from him again.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:43:14.01" data-timestamp="2594.01">The government says this wasn't the end of the story, though. According to the government's case against Caramadre and Radhakrishnan, someone forged clean versions of Bertha Howard's signature and used them to open an account.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:43:26.22" data-timestamp="2606.22">And it wasn't just Stephanie's mom. In November 2011, a Rhode Island grand jury issued a 66-count indictment against Caramadre and Radhakrishnan. Five of those counts involve forged signatures of dying people.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:43:40.52" data-timestamp="2620.52">Caramadre denies the government's allegations. He says in four out of five of those cases, what the government alleges to be forgeries were, in fact, real signatures. In the case of Stephanie Porter's mom, he says, her application was used to open an account by mistake, but no money was ever invested in that account. Documents show this to be the case.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:43:59.17" data-timestamp="2639.17">But the government makes other allegations as well. They charge in the indictment that Radhakrishnan, at Caramadre's behest, misled people about the true purpose of the documents they were signing in order to get their signatures and personal information.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:44:12.87" data-timestamp="2652.87">The indictment lays out 25 cases where the government alleges that this happened. According to the government, Radhakrishnan told some dying people their signatures were simply to acknowledge receipt of a charitable donation. Others he allegedly told that their family members would be the beneficiaries.</p><p begin="00:44:28.04" data-timestamp="2668.04">The government also alleges that Radhakrishnan simply wasn't upfront about the purpose of these signatures and that sometimes the dying people had no idea someone else stood to profit. The government says this amounts to a criminal conspiracy on the part of Caramadre and Radhakrishnan to defraud insurance and bond companies and steal the identities of dying people.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:44:46.76" data-timestamp="2686.76">The lead government prosecutor declined to talk to us, as did Raymour Radhakrishnan. Caramadre says the government misunderstood his scheme. He says he instructed Raymour to explain the program fully to all the participants and to make sure that they had an understanding of what they were signing.</p><p begin="00:45:02.75" data-timestamp="2702.75">How were the annuitants victimized, Caramadre asked? They were all financially better off after having gotten involved. He says that during the entire decade and a half he was paying dying people to fill out documents for his scheme, not one of them, or their family members, ever complained to anyone about what he was doing. None of them had a bad word to say about him. That is, until the FBI showed up and started alleging that he had committed crimes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lee Wilker</h4><p begin="00:45:28.24" data-timestamp="2728.24">Good morning Mr. Mizzoni.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Mizzoni</h4><p begin="00:45:28.97" data-timestamp="2728.97">Good morning.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lee Wilker</h4><p begin="00:45:29.64" data-timestamp="2729.64">My name, again, is Lee Wilker.

Mr. Mizzoni has since died. Unlike many of the people Caramadre signed up over the years, Mizzoni had been a close friend of the family.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lee Wilker</h4><p begin="00:46:00.08" data-timestamp="2760.08">So how long have you known Joseph Caramadre?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Mizzoni</h4><p begin="00:46:02.88" data-timestamp="2762.88">When they were little kids, they'd come, and I used to take them in the school bus.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lee Wilker</h4><p begin="00:46:06.27" data-timestamp="2766.27">So you would take Mr. Caramadre and four of his siblings in the school bus?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Mizzoni</h4><p begin="00:46:09.59" data-timestamp="2769.59">Yeah. I had a school bus taking them to school at the Catholic school.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:46:14.06" data-timestamp="2774.06">To Caramadre, Robert Mizzoni offers a prime example of how the prosecutors and the insurance companies turned people who had no beef with him, maybe even liked him, into witnesses against him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:46:24.63" data-timestamp="2784.63">Over the years as Caramadre grew up and got rich, he stayed in close contact with Mizzoni and his wife. They continued to attend the same church, and he would do favors for the Mizzonis. Mr. Mizzoni himself testifies that Caramadre would prepare their tax returns for free. He helped them buy a house.</p><p begin="00:46:41.72" data-timestamp="2801.72">And in 2004, he gave Mr. Mizzoni a check for $2,000 and signed him up as an annuitant. Caramadre says he explained the basics of the program to Mr. Mizzoni, and in fact, Mr. Mizzoni signed an acknowledgement form. But in these videotaped interviews, Mr. Mizzoni said he had no idea what was happening.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Robert Flanders</h4><p begin="00:47:01.07" data-timestamp="2821.07">At some time in the spring of 2004, you met with Mr. Caramadre at his office, and he gave you $2,000, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Mizzoni</h4><p begin="00:47:09.03" data-timestamp="2829.03">Yeah, he gave me $2,000.

Look at the beneficiary-- Paula, his wife.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:50:09.38" data-timestamp="3009.38">We reached out to Agent McDade, but she didn't return our phone calls. An FBI spokesman said they don't comment on active cases. To Caramadre, though, Mizzoni's anger was all about those numbers, millions of dollars that Caramadre would allegedly make off of Robert Mizzoni's death.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joseph Caramadre</h4><p begin="00:50:24.53" data-timestamp="3024.53">He's being informed, or told, or given the understanding that my wife gets $1 million when he dies, and we only invested $10,000. So he doesn't know the real facts. I believe if he thought my wife was getting $10,000 back, and I put up the $10,000, and he already got his $2,000, he may not be upset at that at all. Of course, he would need to have been told the truth.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:51:01.15" data-timestamp="3061.15">In November, a judge or jury will have to decide whether the scheme was a criminal one or not, and the decision in large part comes down to whether or not these dying annuitants understood what they were signing, which, when you think about it, is a complicated question.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:51:15.87" data-timestamp="3075.87">The court will have to suss out what exactly when on in those hospital and hospice rooms between Radhakrishnan and the dying people he was trying to explain Caramadre's scheme to. Remember, he was in his early '20s, just out of college, sitting across from very sick people, many on breathing machines, hopped up on pain medications, anxious family members all around. He was trying to explain how a variable annuity works.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:51:38.80" data-timestamp="3098.8">Looming over all of this are not facts, but feelings, our feelings about death. Death makes a squeamish, and people profiting from death, even more so. Caramadre says that squeamishness blinds people to what was actually going on here. According to court filings, more than 150 terminally ill people got at least $2,000 from Caramadre. Those that signed up to be measuring lives got even more. And sure, Caramadre and his clients stood to profit from people dying, but he's certainly not alone in that regard.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joseph Caramadre</h4><p begin="00:52:11.46" data-timestamp="3131.46">A florist makes money. A church or temple makes money. A casket company makes money. A limousine company makes money. Nursing homes make money when people are sick and die. Hospitals do, OK? Pension plans make money. They can't wait for people to die so they don't have to pay them every month anymore.</p><p begin="00:52:29.46" data-timestamp="3149.46">Our state is waiting for people to die every day so we can clear up this billion-dollar fiasco of paying pensioners. So death is involved in many aspects of our lives. So is it squeamish? Yes. But not if it's done morally, ethically, and legally.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:52:48.77" data-timestamp="3168.77">The legal part will be up to the court to decide. But the moral and ethical parts is where it gets blurry. On the one hand, Joseph Caramadre says before he even began signing up dying people, he vetted the idea with this priest. And in fact, his priest went on to become an annuity investor. The mother of the local monsignor, she served as a measuring life.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:53:07.73" data-timestamp="3187.73">On the other hand, there are people like Stephanie Porter, the woman whose mother was too weak to sign the documents. Even though she and her mom were willing to sign on with Caramadre, as she's learned more, she's horrified.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stephanie Porter</h4><p begin="00:53:20.21" data-timestamp="3200.21">You're using people. You know that they're going to die, and you're using them to your advantage so that you can gain? It just disgusts me to think of it that way.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:53:34.21" data-timestamp="3214.21">When you talk to Caramadre, the way he explains it is, I can get this advantage from the insurance company for myself and my clients. I can pay somebody who is at the end of life a little bit of money for their signature, and everybody is happy. Does that reasoning make any sense to you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stephanie Porter</h4><p begin="00:53:55.69" data-timestamp="3235.69">No. So you put a dollar amount on my mother's death is basically what it comes down to. I lose my mom, who's my best friend, who's my world, and in me losing my mother forever at the age of 64, you in turn profit and get x amount of dollars. It's slimy what the man did.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jake Bernstein</h4><p begin="00:54:33.33" data-timestamp="3273.33">No matter what the court decides, Caramadre's scheme would not be possible today. Several of the companies Caramadre targeted have stopped selling these variable annuities. Not because of what Caramadre did, but because the promises they made are proving too expensive to deliver. Death turned out to be a bad business for them.</p><p begin="00:54:52.01" data-timestamp="3292.01">They are potentially on the hook for a huge amount of money. Some companies have already declared billions in losses. Almost all of them have changed their contracts. Caramadre's loophole has been closed.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:13.51" data-timestamp="3313.51">Jake Bernstein and Alex Blumberg.
