  <h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:00:01.27" data-timestamp="1.27"> From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Chana Joffe-Walt, sitting in for Ira Glass. So a couple of weeks ago, I was calling principals and teachers to find out what it was like to be in schools.</p><p begin="00:00:13.95" data-timestamp="13.95">I called Principal Brian Cox in Wyoming. Did he have a minute to talk?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Cow</h4><p begin="00:00:18.27" data-timestamp="18.27"> Um, I can, yeah. I've got to be out on bus duty in, like, 15 minutes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:00:22.35" data-timestamp="22.35"> Principal Cox normally does not do bus duty. He also does not normally teach French class, because he's a principal, and he doesn't know French. He did both the week we spoke, because 20% of his staff were absent. Omicron.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Cow</h4><p begin="00:00:37.59" data-timestamp="37.59"> You know, I told somebody today when we walked in-- we had three paraprofessionals down in very key special education classrooms-- and I told them our goal today is to be a hockey goalie and just keep it out of the net.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:00:49.44" data-timestamp="49.44"> Two things I learned from calling around to lots of educators over the last few weeks-- school is still a mess. That's the first thing. And number two, the situation in schools right now can only be described using metaphor.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Cow</h4><p begin="00:01:04.56" data-timestamp="64.56"> We're just going to play for eight hours today and try to keep as few of them from getting by us today. And then we'll recoup tonight and figure out how we can recover for tomorrow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Amy Gallaway</h4><p begin="00:01:14.07" data-timestamp="74.07"> Oh, man. This year-- [CHUCKLES] I'll try not to cry. This year has been hard. [CHUCKLES]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:01:20.82" data-timestamp="80.82"> Amy Gallaway, a teacher in Alaska, says, I thought this year was finally going to be normal. This year is not.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Amy Gallaway</h4><p begin="00:01:28.74" data-timestamp="88.74"> Like a creaky, creaky bridge that we're trying to get across.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Math Teacher</h4><p begin="00:01:33.24" data-timestamp="93.24"> The kind of step where you're not going to die, you're going to roll your ankle.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:01:37.17" data-timestamp="97.17"> A math teacher in New York City.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Math Teacher</h4><p begin="00:01:39.47" data-timestamp="99.47"> And land with your face in a mud puddle and be like, OK, I could have probably navigated that obstacle a little bit differently.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:01:51.04" data-timestamp="111.04"> There are not enough teachers. There are not enough school bus drivers. You never know which students will come in person, if at all. Some kids have just disappeared. Enrollment and attendance-- way down.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Takeru Nagayoshi</h4><p begin="00:02:03.21" data-timestamp="123.21"> The metaphor that I would always use is like, it's as though you are creating a vehicle--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:02:12.15" data-timestamp="132.15"> You can tell this guy is about to go in really deep, right? English teacher.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Takeru Nagayoshi</h4><p begin="00:02:16.59" data-timestamp="136.59"> --while driving it at the same time on a road whose conditions are unclear in terrible weather. That vehicle, by the way, is a school bus. And not only are there 120 kids there, you're also driving from the back of the bus.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:02:34.82" data-timestamp="154.82"> [LAUGHS] That's a metaphor that never ends.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>English Teacher</h4><p begin="00:02:37.02" data-timestamp="157.02"> Yeah. It just compounds.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:02:39.84" data-timestamp="159.84"> Takeru Nagayoshi, a high school teacher in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Mr. Nagayoshi was Massachusetts teacher of the year for 2020. In 2021, he quit his job-- quit his job, right after being publicly recognized as the very best.</p><p begin="00:02:58.26" data-timestamp="178.26">He was at the top of his game, and he walked away, which is a pretty huge reversal. He didn't plan to leave public school teaching. When schools closed and everything went online, Mr. Nagayoshi missed the classroom deeply. He missed all the things you can only do when everyone is in a room together.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Takeru Nagayoshi</h4><p begin="00:03:17.94" data-timestamp="197.94"> The group activities, the collaborative mood board work that my kids do, writing on anchor charts, breaking up into small groups, doing practice rounds of public speaking, and Socratic seminars, and peer writing, and taking out your pens so that you can highlight things on your papers, and give that feedback, and offer commentary to each other's research questions. And there are so many opportunities and magic that I think happens in person. And when I think about learning, it's such a social thing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:03:49.32" data-timestamp="229.32"> He was used to feeling inspired every day, energized. But even when they were back in person, Mr. Nagayoshi never got that feeling back. His students didn't get to school on time or regularly at all. And they just weren't focused.</p><p begin="00:04:05.40" data-timestamp="245.4">They were grieving for people they loved. They were stressed or depressed, juggling lots of responsibilities, or staying up until 4:00 AM playing video games. And they were just out of the habit of doing school. School had been such a regular routine before, for kids, for everyone.</p><p begin="00:04:24.15" data-timestamp="264.15">Mr. Nagayoshi told me he started to question if what they were doing was really serving kids. He questioned the most basic things about the way school functions. Like, why did the school day have to be so long? All the rigid routines-- why do they have to learn in class periods? Why every day?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Takeru Nagayoshi</h4><p begin="00:04:42.99" data-timestamp="282.99"> Sometimes, I just felt more like a gatekeeper to, like, archaic ways of learning and convening. I don't know, Chana, I just feel like the seal has been broken, and I don't-- and it's hard for me to imagine a world to go back to that magic.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:05:02.24" data-timestamp="302.24"> Whoa. What seal has been broken? What does that mean?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Takeru Nagayoshi</h4><p begin="00:05:06.65" data-timestamp="306.65"> The-- [SIGHS] what is the seal that has been broken? I think, our relationship to what school is.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:05:25.56" data-timestamp="325.56"> It's been two years since school buildings first closed. It's kind of hard to remember how impossible that seemed before it happened-- closing entire school buildings. School seemed like a fact, inevitable. If you're a kid, you go to school five days a week. It's inescapable.</p><p begin="00:05:43.86" data-timestamp="343.86">But then, it wasn't anymore. Buildings closed for months, more than a year. This happened in lots of different ways across the country. It was worse for some, better for others. But talking with teachers and parents and kids, it's clear that school as they left it March 2020 does not look the same as the school they have now.</p><p begin="00:06:05.19" data-timestamp="365.19">Classrooms still close. School buses don't come. Or teachers are out sick, or there aren't enough teachers. Some districts have just decided kids don't need to come in on Fridays now. In the state of Missouri, 1/4 of the school districts have now decided to switch to four days of school a week, instead of five.</p><p begin="00:06:24.18" data-timestamp="384.18">Some kids stopped coming altogether. School had always been this solid object that now seems much less solid. So many of the people I've been speaking with are questioning the very premise of school, whether it's worth it, whether they need to show up every day, whether they need to be in a classroom.</p><p begin="00:06:45.15" data-timestamp="405.15">It's like everyone involved-- kids, parents, drivers, teachers, superintendents-- all realized at the same time, hey, this treadmill has an off switch. This place is not fact. School is not inevitable. Just listen to the way Mr. Nagayoshi talks about when school was inevitable, back before the pandemic, just a few years ago.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Takeru Nagayoshi</h4><p begin="00:07:09.81" data-timestamp="429.81"> Sure, it was hard, and things were never perfect, but it was a different time. And I don't know if we can ever get back to that. I think it's a bygone era.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:07:19.08" data-timestamp="439.08"> Like, the way we've done public school for more than a century?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Takeru Nagayoshi</h4><p begin="00:07:23.64" data-timestamp="443.64"> Mm-hmm.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:07:24.87" data-timestamp="444.87"> [CHUCKLES] It's gone?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Takeru Nagayoshi</h4><p begin="00:07:26.34" data-timestamp="446.34"> I don't-- I think it is.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:07:29.26" data-timestamp="449.26"> Is it? Is school as we've known it over? Today, I want to bring you the stories of two kids who have drifted away from school. And we see what happens when they try to make their way back. Stay with us.</p><p begin="00:07:56.76" data-timestamp="476.76">The last couple of months, I've been talking with principals, teachers, parents, and kids about school and what's changed for them two years into a pandemic. And I keep returning to that question-- have schools fundamentally changed? One of the people I've been checking in with, on and off for a while now, is a woman named MJ and her daughter, Neeah.</p><p begin="00:08:16.05" data-timestamp="496.05">They're a family of three. MJ is a single parent. Neeah is her youngest, and she has an older daughter, who's grown. They're mixed-race, live in Michigan with a French bulldog. During the pandemic, MJ and Neeah constructed a brand-new and very unusual life with one another. And seeing how much has changed for them, where they ended up after two years of pandemic school, that, maybe more than anyone else I've spoken with, made me feel like, whoa, maybe school as we once knew it truly is over.</p><p begin="00:08:48.60" data-timestamp="528.6"></p></div>  </div>

  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:08:49.72" data-timestamp="529.72"> So here's Act One, Big Mother Is Watching. It begins, of course, when the schools closed two years ago.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>MJ</h4><p begin="00:08:57.84" data-timestamp="537.84"> Oh, my god. You want to talk about stress? Man.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:09:02.04" data-timestamp="542.04"> What happened?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>MJ</h4><p begin="00:09:02.73" data-timestamp="542.73"> Oh, yeah. It just-- like, what do you do?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:09:06.69" data-timestamp="546.69"> MJ is a building engineer. She had to go to work. She supervises all the maintenance for buildings she works in around Detroit-- make sure the boilers, lighting, carpentry are all attended to. So at first, she just brought Neeah to work.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>MJ</h4><p begin="00:09:21.75" data-timestamp="561.75"> It was fun, you know what I mean? She didn't get in my way, running around while I'm cleaning up, you know, that area that I have to. So you know, I rode the wave as long as I could.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:09:30.81" data-timestamp="570.81"> When her boss made it clear that this was not a long-term arrangement, MJ dropped Neeah with an aunt, then a friend, a babysitter. A neighbor took her for a week.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>MJ</h4><p begin="00:09:40.83" data-timestamp="580.83"> You know, even if it's just a day, OK, exactly how long can they help? You know, throw them money. How much can you afford? Absolutely nothing, but we'll make it work anyway. It's a never-- it's a whole thing. It's exhausting, mentally. Exhausting, OK?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:09:57.18" data-timestamp="597.18"> And it was months. MJ had a new thought. Neeah was nine years old. She could prepare food herself, get herself dressed. A lot of parents leave kids her age at home alone. But MJ hadn't before, certainly not all day. And she did not want to now, but she had to go to work. She'd be 10 minutes away. She could come home at lunch to check in. Neeah would be on Zoom all day, with a teacher from school.</p><p begin="00:10:24.15" data-timestamp="624.15">A while back, a friend had recommended security cameras when MJ moved into a new house. MJ ordered a couple. Neeah stayed home alone. MJ left, telling herself, I've got the cameras.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>MJ</h4><p begin="00:10:37.14" data-timestamp="637.14"> I could see her in different areas of the house. And I have an alarm system that, if any window or doors opened, it alerts the police and makes a really loud noise. And you know, depending on the area of the house that Neeah's in, she knows what the escape route is and what the emergency plan is.</p><p begin="00:10:57.75" data-timestamp="657.75">You know, it's not something that I wanted to do. I wasn't happy to do it, but I can see my kid. You know, like I said, I got a friend behind me, my neighbor across-- the old lady across the street. Gotta love them, you know?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:11:09.63" data-timestamp="669.63"> When did you first start watching?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>MJ</h4><p begin="00:11:12.90" data-timestamp="672.9"> Right away.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:11:13.77" data-timestamp="673.77"> Oh, really?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>MJ</h4><p begin="00:11:14.25" data-timestamp="674.25"> No, no, right away. Oh, god, yeah. No. My kid's got to be home by herself? I got to keep my eyes on the camera.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:11:20.49" data-timestamp="680.49"> MJ went to work and propped the phone up next to her, all day. If she had to walk, she'd hold the phone in front of her, and she'd watch as Neeah ate breakfast, signed on to school. When MJ couldn't have eyes on the phone, she'd put it in her pocket and put headphones in to listen.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>MJ</h4><p begin="00:11:38.22" data-timestamp="698.22"> It's never not been a distraction. I'm always busy, but I have to keep my daughter in my ear, because she's home by herself. You know? So it did interfere with work, you know. It's what I do. Like, I'm on a ladder, trying to change lights, and you know, I've got my phone.</p><p begin="00:11:53.46" data-timestamp="713.46">Like, I'll set it up somewhere. I'll put, like, the phone in my pocket, put my earphones in, so I can at least hear. And if, you know, something sounds awry, like if I hear a bang, I'd pull my phone out, look at the camera real quick. But I'm always listening.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:12:07.14" data-timestamp="727.14"> On a ladder?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>MJ</h4><p begin="00:12:08.16" data-timestamp="728.16"> Always listening.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:12:08.37" data-timestamp="728.37"> I hate this picture, MJ.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>MJ</h4><p begin="00:12:09.60" data-timestamp="729.6"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:12:10.02" data-timestamp="730.02"> You're standing on a ladder, looking at your phone.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>MJ</h4><p begin="00:12:12.27" data-timestamp="732.27"> Changing a fluorescent light in a hallway. And yeah, and you'll hear-- now, if you subtract, da-da-da-dah, and like you hear the kids. They're so loud. Yeah, it's bad. It was bad. [CHUCKLES]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:12:27.69" data-timestamp="747.69"> MJ watched as much as she could, listened when she couldn't. She was monitoring to keep Neeah safe. But as she watched, MJ started to notice some other things.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>MJ</h4><p begin="00:12:38.08" data-timestamp="758.08"> Oh. [CHUCKLES] Like, I'm very big on eating in my living room. Like, I don't like to-- I don't like when you eat or drink in my living room. And I've caught her so many times eating and drinking in the living room and setting it next to the laptop. And I don't like my dog on the couch all the time, because he licks his paw, and then licks the couch. And it's just gross. And she'll let him on the couch.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:12:59.19" data-timestamp="779.19"> MJ told me, on the app, you can see everything. And there's a big button right there-- Microphone. If you press it, your voice will blast into the room, sounding sort of like a loud walkie-talkie. I asked--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:13:11.58" data-timestamp="791.58"> So did you use it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>MJ</h4><p begin="00:13:13.41" data-timestamp="793.41"> Oh, oh, hell yeah.

You need to go put it in the kitchen. Neeah, quit playing with the dog and focus. Turn off the TV. You're not supposed to have the TV on. If you're going to listen to the music, no lyrics. Yeah, it's just constant redirection and correction, over and over.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:13:53.91" data-timestamp="833.91"> What were the ones that you said the most often?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>MJ</h4><p begin="00:13:56.07" data-timestamp="836.07"> All of 'em.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:13:57.60" data-timestamp="837.6"> The app apparently can also record.

There was an incident with Neeah, another kid, and a marker.

She does everything alone, independently.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neeah</h4><p begin="00:30:36.49" data-timestamp="1836.49"> I just wake up in the morning.

Neeah told me she likes that she can pace herself. She structures her own day. Sometimes, she starts at 8:00 AM, sometimes 9:00. Works for a couple hours, then has lunch. Watches Netflix, and just keeps going until she's done.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neeah</h4><p begin="00:31:20.81" data-timestamp="1880.81"> I can just-- like, if it takes me all day, I'll do it all day.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>MJ</h4><p begin="00:31:24.10" data-timestamp="1884.1"> I would like for it to be done before I get home, though, you know?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neeah</h4><p begin="00:31:26.98" data-timestamp="1886.98"> I always get it done.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>MJ</h4><p begin="00:31:27.43" data-timestamp="1887.43"> She shouldn't be in school while I'm getting home from work.

It lacks every element I might have said defines what school is. She doesn't go to a building. There's no teaching, no schedule, no classmates. That's the part I couldn't get over. No kids. The only person Neeah talks to all day is her mom.</p><p begin="00:32:23.57" data-timestamp="1943.57">That part worries MJ, that Neeah's missing everything about school that mattered most to MJ as a kid. MJ says school's where I figured out who I was. It's where I learned I'm not the prettiest girl, but the fastest on field day. It's where she learned when to fight, how to apologize.</p><p begin="00:32:40.71" data-timestamp="1960.71">It's where she made her best friends, lifelong friendships, she says, of 26-plus years. She's worried Neeah is missing all of that. But Neeah sounds pretty settled, like she'd finally arrived.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neeah</h4><p begin="00:32:54.62" data-timestamp="1974.62"> Total peace and quiet is my kind of thing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:32:58.55" data-timestamp="1978.55"> When Neeah takes a break or finishes her online work, she sits on the couch at home, and she watches her favorite show on Netflix-- <i>Alexa</i> <i>and</i> <i>Katie.</i> It's a wholesome sitcom about two best friends. One gets cancer, but survives. And now, they're heading to high school for the first time, choosing their first-day-of-school outfits. Will they have the same lunch period?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:33:18.39" data-timestamp="1998.39"> Everyone, get out your school schedules.

That's in three days.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:33:32.13" data-timestamp="2012.13"> This is what Neeah's watching from her dystopian cyber school surveillance state. She's watching school. When Takeru Nagayoshi, the Teacher of the Year, who we heard from at the beginning of this show, told me pre-pandemic school was a bygone era, I think this is what that looks like-- Neeah watching school alone in her home, with cameras watching her.</p><p begin="00:34:02.31" data-timestamp="2042.31">That's where this story was going to end. But last week, as I was putting it together, I got one more message from MJ. She said she learned Neeah had not been submitting assignments in her online school. Turns out a teacher-less outsourced program with no actual person-to-person interaction did not work. Or at least, it didn't work for Neeah.</p><p begin="00:34:23.13" data-timestamp="2063.13">MJ was deeply deflated. Her system had failed, and the school system had failed, too. She told me she'd decided to send Neeah back to school in person, for now. That is, until she figures out what's next.</p><p begin="00:34:48.44" data-timestamp="2088.44">Coming up, a kid who disappeared from school a year and a half ago shows up again and tries to just blend in. That's in a minute from Chicago Public Radio when our program continues.</p><p begin="00:35:05.45" data-timestamp="2105.45">It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Chana Joffe-Walt, sitting in for Ira Glass. At the show this year, we've been talking a lot about a feeling we've all noticed around us-- a feeling of unraveling. We're doing a couple of episodes about people who are facing things that feel like they're coming apart in front of them. Like, we did a show a couple of weeks ago about cities and towns becoming unlivable with climate change.</p><p begin="00:35:30.47" data-timestamp="2130.47">This episode is also about that feeling, a slow-moving unraveling in schools. We are now in the third consecutive school year disrupted by COVID-- disruptions that have at times undone even the most basic foundational part of what school is, like the idea that kids go to school every day. Attendance is down. Enrollment is down.</p><p begin="00:35:55.46" data-timestamp="2155.46">I remember back when schools first closed two years ago, there were kids who just disappeared. I saw a report in the fall of 2020 that estimated three million kids were out of touch with school. A principal in Los Angeles, Vanessa Garza, told me about one of them-- a student they completely lost track of when schools closed in March 2020. And then a month into this school year, I was talking with Principal Garza on the phone, and she says, oh, that girl who disappeared back in spring 2020--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Principal Garza</h4><p begin="00:36:26.72" data-timestamp="2186.72"> Literally, yesterday, that student and her family just re-enrolled with us.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:36:32.24" data-timestamp="2192.24"> Just yesterday?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Principal Garza</h4><p begin="00:36:33.92" data-timestamp="2193.92"> Exactly. You know, I'd like to come back. We're like, great. Let's get a copy of your records. Where were you? What school were you at, so I can request them? And they're like, I didn't go to school. So in the time that the pandemic started and shut down our schools, March 13, 2020, till now, that student hasn't been in school.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:36:55.52" data-timestamp="2215.52"> She never finished sixth grade, missed all of seventh grade. And now here she was, a month into her eighth-grade school year, ready to return. This kid-- I'm going to call her Maricela. That's not her real name.</p><p begin="00:37:09.74" data-timestamp="2229.74">Her mom told me I could meet her at school for one of her first days back, which I really wanted to, because I'd always wanted to know, what were kids who were not in school doing all that time? Literally, like, what was she doing with her time? What were her days like for the last year and a half? And what would it be like to come back to school?</p><p begin="00:37:28.34" data-timestamp="2248.34"></p></div>  </div>

  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:37:29.55" data-timestamp="2249.55"> So that is Act Two, The Case of the Vanishing Sixth Grader.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:37:34.34" data-timestamp="2254.34"> Good morning.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Principal Garza</h4><p begin="00:37:35.21" data-timestamp="2255.21"> Hi. Good morning.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:37:36.92" data-timestamp="2256.92"> I'm waiting in the hallway with Principal Vanessa Garza at the Girls' Athletic Leadership School, GALS. It's a charter school in Los Angeles, one of those California schools where lots of stuff happens outside next to palm trees. Almost all the students are Latina, some from transnational families that will travel back and forth to family in Mexico or Central America for holidays.</p><p begin="00:37:59.75" data-timestamp="2279.75">Sometimes, students who have just moved to LA from those places show up at GALS. But a kid who's been missing for 18 months-- that is not common. Principal Vanessa Garza is eagerly scanning the hallway, looking for Maricela. Is she actually going to show?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Principal Garza</h4><p begin="00:38:16.13" data-timestamp="2296.13"> Fingers crossed. It's almost 7:30 right now. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:38:20.18" data-timestamp="2300.18"> We turned to see another staff member hustling down the hall toward us, silently waving her arms and mouthing, she's here!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:38:28.40" data-timestamp="2308.4"> She's here? Yay! All right.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:38:32.27" data-timestamp="2312.27"> The second Maricela walked into the building, I felt like, OK, I'm finally going to get my answer. Where has she been? What happened? And what's it like to be back here?</p><p begin="00:38:43.13" data-timestamp="2323.13">But she's kind of like a famous person right now, so I had to wait my turn. She enters the hallway to the school, and immediately gets sort of trapped between the bathroom, the main office, and her principal, who can barely contain her excitement.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Principal Garza</h4><p begin="00:38:57.89" data-timestamp="2337.89"> Good morning! How are you? Did you get a chance to get breakfast?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:39:04.49" data-timestamp="2344.49"> Maricela's got long, straight, black hair parted in the middle, gray leggings, and a red JanSport backpack. She's barely audible, arms at her chest. She looks like she'd very much like to make herself smaller, less visible, but her overeager host keeps offering her things.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Principal Garza</h4><p begin="00:39:21.77" data-timestamp="2361.77"> Do you want to grab something that you can save for later? Because it's just coffee cake. You're good? OK. You're in Ms. Elaina's wellness team, right? All right, so let's walk over there and check in with Ms. Elaina. And then, I'll get you a fresh mask, too. It looks like that one is well-loved, right? [CHUCKLES]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:39:43.43" data-timestamp="2383.43"> Maricela does not laugh or react at all. The wellness team-- that's the school's version of homeroom. It's down the hall and around the corner. Outside the classroom is Ms. Elaina, a tiny blonde teacher from Wisconsin. Hi, she says. How are you doing? Inaudible word.</p><p begin="00:40:03.62" data-timestamp="2403.62">Ms. Elaina guides Maricela into the classroom, saying, did you hear the thunderstorm last night? Silent nod. It was wild, right? Nothing. It's early still. There are only a couple of kids in the classroom.</p><p begin="00:40:17.85" data-timestamp="2417.85">Maricela sits, and Ms. Elaina pulls up right next to her to quietly explain what the homeroom class will be going over today, before first period starts. She says, just yesterday, they began preparing all the eighth-graders for high school applications.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ms. Elaina</h4><p begin="00:40:33.24" data-timestamp="2433.24"> Um, have you been able to talk with your mom at all about the high schools that may be good for you, like ones that are nearby, or ones that you're interested in going to?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:40:42.75" data-timestamp="2442.75"> No, not yet.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ms. Elaina</h4><p begin="00:40:43.80" data-timestamp="2443.8"> So that would be-- hey, morning.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:40:46.92" data-timestamp="2446.92"> Kids are trickling in. Maricela's body is slowly forming into a U-shape around the desk. Like, maybe she thinks she'll blend in, and no one will notice there's anything here but a desk. Meanwhile, Ms. Elaina opens up a laptop to show Maricela some info on her options for high school.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ms. Elaina</h4><p begin="00:41:05.17" data-timestamp="2465.17"> A religious school, a charter school, an LAUSD neighborhood school, meaning, like, one of the LAUSD schools where you live right around.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:41:12.39" data-timestamp="2472.39"> Nobody acknowledges how strange it is that they're talking about high school, given Maricela has missed most of middle school so far. The last time she was here, she was 11 years old. She's now 13. Sixth to eighth grade-- a lot happens between sixth and eighth grade.</p><p begin="00:41:31.56" data-timestamp="2491.56">I keep thinking of the blip, that thing from <i>The</i> <i>Avengers</i> where Thanos snaps his fingers? It's like Maricela blipped middle school. When she left sixth grade, they were covering early Roman civilization. She missed the entire fall of the Roman Empire-- that was seventh grade-- medieval Europe, too, and the Renaissance.</p><p begin="00:41:50.07" data-timestamp="2510.07">She also missed geometry, photosynthesis, chemistry. She missed a year and a half of reading and writing. And then, blip, eighth grade. Time to move on. Time to fill out a Google form on the transition to high school.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ms. Elaina</h4><p begin="00:42:04.30" data-timestamp="2524.3"> So it's asking for your name. And then go ahead and scroll down to, which color gown do you want to wear at graduation? That's exciting. You get to vote on your gown already.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:42:13.68" data-timestamp="2533.68"> Maricela does not look excited.</p><p begin="00:42:23.70" data-timestamp="2543.7">Apparently, Maricela said she wanted to speak with me, but that was now hard to imagine. She was barely speaking to anyone. I couldn't imagine her feeling comfortable enough to share anything.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:42:34.59" data-timestamp="2554.59"> Do you want to go into-- there's, like, a little office. Or do you rather want to sit here?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:42:38.74" data-timestamp="2558.74"> Go in the little office.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:42:39.66" data-timestamp="2559.66"> You wanna go in the little office? OK, let me see if Ms. Vanessa can get it for me. Just give me one second.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:42:43.95" data-timestamp="2563.95"> A short, agonizing walk through the hall, kids watching us, Maricela intently studying the floor tiles. We get to the room.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:42:51.42" data-timestamp="2571.42"> Here we go. You can sit right there.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:42:56.05" data-timestamp="2576.05"> But then, as soon as we were in this room, I'd barely asked a question-- I said, so I talked to your mom, and then Maricela was telling me about her mom.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:43:05.13" data-timestamp="2585.13"> She helps people, because she even helped this lady. She was, like, 21, and she had a dog.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:43:10.89" data-timestamp="2590.89"> She was our neighbor, but then she got kicked out because the dog was biting the walls. I'd make them food. I'm a really good cook, way better than my sister. Did you know I have a sister? I don't have to go to movement class today, because I have an injury. I have a note. Do you want to see?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:43:23.85" data-timestamp="2603.85"> I'm scared to play soccer now, because we had a leak at the old apartment. And I, like, messed up my knee. And there's sometimes where my bone just pops out. I, like, just fall.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:43:33.57" data-timestamp="2613.57"> My sister doesn't even help me, Maricela says. Did you know I have a sister? Yeah, she's younger. A brother, too. But the sister's really annoying. When she doesn't get what she wants, she smacks me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:43:43.65" data-timestamp="2623.65"> And then, when I told my mom, she says, no, I didn't. And she talks a lot. [CHUCKLES]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:43:49.11" data-timestamp="2629.11"> Maricela talks a lot about everything. I had assumed when I saw her in the hallway there was no way I was going to get her to tell me what happened. Where was she that whole time? Was she just at home? What'd she do? And what happened with school?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:44:04.80" data-timestamp="2644.8"> OK, so let me ask you about school.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:44:08.19" data-timestamp="2648.19"> In sixth grade, I went to this school. And then I missed one year of school, because I had to go to Mexico.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:44:16.62" data-timestamp="2656.62"> Why?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:44:17.79" data-timestamp="2657.79"> Huh? Because at that time, it was like my grandma and my grandpa were, like, really sick. And then, being over there, we had to take care of my grandma, my grandpa.</p><p begin="00:44:28.74" data-timestamp="2668.74">My grandpa's mom, she had COVID in the same house we lived in. She had COVID, and she was sitting down at her bed when she started, like, hallucinating. And then, she passed away. After that, my grandpa and my grandma got sick.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:44:45.57" data-timestamp="2685.57"> Maricela and her siblings had to isolate in a room, so they wouldn't get sick too, for weeks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:44:51.54" data-timestamp="2691.54"> My mom's oldest sister had to, like, leave the food, like, outside our doors.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:44:56.58" data-timestamp="2696.58"> So you were just living in a room with your siblings, not able to leave the room, getting food delivered to the door?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:45:02.19" data-timestamp="2702.19"> Yeah. I don't really like it, 'cause I don't like to be, like, locked up.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:45:09.82" data-timestamp="2709.82"> And what did you do all day?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:45:13.38" data-timestamp="2713.38"> Um, we had to stay in the-- I had a computer over there, a touchscreen computer. I would play Roblox on there, or watch videos, or do whatever I wanted to do. And my sister had her iPad. And I had a TV, and my brother would use the TV.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:45:31.62" data-timestamp="2731.62"> Screens, a lot of screens. Of course. What were millions of missing kids up to when school buildings closed? Playing Roblox. I don't know what I expected. But talking to Maricela and hearing her lay out what happened over those 18 months she was absent from school, it did feel like such an interior, specific view.</p><p begin="00:45:52.89" data-timestamp="2752.89">I'd been thinking about this as a story of a kid who disappeared from school. But of course, that's not Maricela's story about herself. In Maricela's telling, she didn't disappear, school disappeared.</p><p begin="00:46:05.43" data-timestamp="2765.43">So much of our conversation about schools right now, our ideas about what schools need, what needs to happen to help kids catch up, to get back to normal, usually comes from the perspective of teachers, parents, adults. I want you to hear Maricela's version of this, to hear what it's been like for one of the millions of kids during the pandemic who just stopped attending school-- all the details that matter to her, the stuff that is at eye-level to a kid, stuff adults don't always think to focus on.</p><p begin="00:46:36.87" data-timestamp="2796.87">It was not a blip for Maricela, it was epic. A lot happened. First, her mom lost her job. Then, her grandparents got sick. And while they were in Mexico, they lost their apartment in Los Angeles. The manager said they'd abandoned it. When they came back to Los Angeles, Maricela's aunt said they could stay with her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:46:56.43" data-timestamp="2816.43"> We all had our schedules, like, who does this, who does that. For example, like, we would wake up, and we would sleep in the living room. We would pick up, we would vacuum the whole living room. We would have to wash the dishes, cook, and then wash those dishes, and broom the kitchen, clean the table after we're done eating, and then clean the bathroom, if it's dirty.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:47:23.78" data-timestamp="2843.78"> Her cousins' kids, though, her aunt's kids-- Maricela says they hardly did anything. She's the oldest in her family. It's her and a younger brother and sister. So a lot of the chores fell to her. It wasn't fair.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:47:34.88" data-timestamp="2854.88"> And I couldn't tell them anything, because they're snitches. And they told their parents everything about what they do. So I would just ignore it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:47:45.29" data-timestamp="2865.29"> It got tense in the apartment. And sometime in the middle of what would have been Maricela's seventh-grade school year, her family moved into their truck. They'd drive to the park she always played at and grab a spot every night. In the daytime, they had a routine. Her younger brother and sister would sleep in the back.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:48:02.30" data-timestamp="2882.3"> They would wake up, like, around 9:00. We would go get breakfast while they were sleeping. We would wake-- we would go park at the park again, and then they would wake up. We would fix the seats, and then they would sit down and eat breakfast.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:48:17.18" data-timestamp="2897.18"> And then, what would happen? What would you do the rest of the day?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:48:19.40" data-timestamp="2899.4"> And then, we would go to my mom's-- to my cousin's house, and we would shower there. We had bathrooms at the park. And to brush our teeth, we'd just brush them like-- we would go to the bathroom, take a water bottle, toothpaste, and my toothbrush, and we would brush them in there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:48:40.31" data-timestamp="2920.31"> I talked to Maricela's mom. She confirmed the basics. She lost her job when the pandemic hit, the apartment. They went to Mexico to care for her folks. But she didn't want to do an interview or get into any of this in detail.</p><p begin="00:48:52.97" data-timestamp="2932.97">So I don't know much about where her head was at or what shaped all the different choices she had to make during that time. She wanted to let Maricela share her experience. When they were staying in the truck, Maricela's mom called LA Family Housing. A caseworker got them a place in a hotel. That's where they're living now.</p><p begin="00:49:12.59" data-timestamp="2952.59">And then, the caseworker asked where Maricela wanted to register for school. I don't know if she asked or if she told her she had to. GALS is 40 minutes, in traffic, from the hotel. Maybe somewhere closer, she asked? No, Maricela said. She'd prefer to go back to the school she knows.</p><p begin="00:49:38.48" data-timestamp="2978.48">It's funny, when you think about it, that very basic idea that school is where you go as a kid, the thing the rest of life revolves around, it took centuries to establish. It took laws, and social movements, and fiery speeches to establish a sprawling compulsory public education system. But it only took a few months-- weeks, even, with Maricela-- for that idea to be completely undone.</p><p begin="00:50:05.21" data-timestamp="3005.21">And when it was, when school disappeared from Maricela's life, all the other things-- more immediate, huge dramas-- came in and filled the space. Her mom lost her job. They lived in a truck. She sold candy in the park. Her cousins were snitches. Her family died.</p><p begin="00:50:21.86" data-timestamp="3021.86">She can talk about all of that for hours. But when I asked Maricela, what about school, she just sort of drifts to some other topic. Not that she doesn't want to talk about it, it almost felt like she didn't remember when the pandemic closed schools. It didn't register.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:50:39.17" data-timestamp="3039.17"> What did you do in sixth grade when schools closed?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:50:42.30" data-timestamp="3042.3"> Um, in sixth grade, when school closed, I didn't finish sixth grade.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:50:50.21" data-timestamp="3050.21"> Why?

Valeria was Maricela's best friend at school. She lived in her building. The vague fog Maricela has when I ask her about school evaporated instantly when the conversation turned to Valeria in sixth grade.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:51:36.15" data-timestamp="3096.15"> No, I met her-- OK, so when she came from Mexico, she would, like, go to my house a lot. We lived in the same building, and she would go, like, at 6:00 in the morning, and we would come on our way to school together. And we were, like, really close friends that-- this one time, she was knocking at my door, and I opened it, and then we made breakfast together, and then we served--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:52:00.71" data-timestamp="3120.71"> Maricela became so specific when she talked about Valeria, in that kid way where she's living it in real time, where every detail of a story is shared and assigned exactly equal weight. She knocked. I opened the door. We made breakfast. Here's who came. Here's where we sat. Here's what we ate.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:52:19.71" data-timestamp="3139.71"> --like a tortilla. And then you crack an egg on top. And then, we sliced, like, tomatoes and onions, and we put it on the top. She went to her house, and she got clothes. And she showered in my mom's bathroom while I showered in mine. And then--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:52:34.58" data-timestamp="3154.58"> They went out walking, and they ran into Maricela's aunt, who gave her some cash. They went to the store. Maricela snuck to the side and bought something special.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:52:43.64" data-timestamp="3163.64"> They were, like, little silver hearts that come apart, and they said, "best friends."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:52:50.93" data-timestamp="3170.93"> Like one of those best-friend hearts, broken heart?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:52:54.14" data-timestamp="3174.14"> Yeah, but it was like a keychain thing, and we both had it, like, on our backpack. And when we came to the school both together, we were, like, so close. And we would hang out with the other girls, but there was, like, always a space with the other girls.</p><p begin="00:53:13.19" data-timestamp="3193.19">But me and her were, like, always next to each other. We were, like, really best friends. And then, we would go to the bathroom, and she would wait for me, like, outside the stall. And then she would go in, and I would wait for her.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:53:26.86" data-timestamp="3206.86"> March 2020, schools closed and upended the lives of millions of families. But again, that's not what Maricela remembers of this time. March 2020, the day before Maricela went to Mexico, what she remembers is that she had a picnic with Valeria at the Valley Plaza Park. Their families came. They ate Pollo Loco.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:53:48.40" data-timestamp="3228.4"> That day, it was her birthday. And I had to tell her that we were leaving. But her brother-- her brother knew before her, but we were supposed to surprise her. But when we were singing Happy Birthday, he told her. And then her eyes got kind of watery.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:54:15.02" data-timestamp="3255.02"> What about you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:54:16.49" data-timestamp="3256.49"> I wanted to cry.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:54:18.71" data-timestamp="3258.71"> Did you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:54:19.61" data-timestamp="3259.61"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:54:22.01" data-timestamp="3262.01"> Maricela told Valeria she'd see her soon, but she never did. Valeria's family had been trying to make it work in LA, but struggled in those early months of the pandemic, and decided to move back to Ciudad Juarez. That was the last time they saw each other.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:54:44.96" data-timestamp="3284.96"> How does it feel to walk through the halls now?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:54:47.95" data-timestamp="3287.95"> OK.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:54:49.74" data-timestamp="3289.74"> Knowing what the last year and a half was for Maricela, that it was not a blip, but a long time for a 12-year-old, full of huge experiences, I consider how brave it is what she's doing-- returning to this place that disappeared from her life, coming back after losing family members, her apartment, moving between countries, returning without knowing anything about what she's missed and without Valeria.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:55:14.46" data-timestamp="3314.46"> I was nervous, scared. I was like nervous, like, who I will see here. I go to the school, and then I leave. And then I come back, and they just stare at you the whole time.

Like, who can tell me what we know about the monarchy? Who remembers? The elites-- what do we mean by elites? You guys remember? Maricela, of course, does not remember.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Teacher 2</h4><p begin="00:56:11.61" data-timestamp="3371.61"> OK, so we're going to do quite a bit of reading today.

Maricela can't figure out how to submit her response. She's frustrated, but does not ask for help, does not know about the monarchy. She does not know how to use the online learning platform, and she does not speak to anyone.</p><p begin="00:56:35.64" data-timestamp="3395.64">She's here. She's finally in the building, but she's still really far away. I felt that deeply, watching her in math. They're playing a game. Everyone has to get up and split it into two groups, but Maricela doesn't move.</p><p begin="00:56:49.58" data-timestamp="3409.58">She's sitting in the back row, and she stays completely still, backpack propped on her desk, looking panicked as the other kids get up and sort themselves into teams. She's wearing a mic clipped to her shirt. She's too far from anyone else for them to hear what she's saying, but I can.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:57:09.16" data-timestamp="3429.16"> [GROANS] My stomach hurts.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:57:12.36" data-timestamp="3432.36"> The teacher notices that Maricela hasn't moved.

Come on.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Teacher 3</h4><p begin="00:57:21.03" data-timestamp="3441.03"> You, too, pick a group.

It's just math.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:57:29.04" data-timestamp="3449.04"> It's just math, the teacher says. But it is clearly not just math to Maricela. I keep waiting for someone to talk to her, to ask her something. What's going on with you? Where were you? What do you need?</p><p begin="00:57:43.78" data-timestamp="3463.78">But school, day-to-day school, is not really set up for that. Her teachers will assess where Maricela is academically. And there's an aide in classes that could help her one-on-one, sometimes. But mostly, school is like this.</p><p begin="00:57:59.37" data-timestamp="3479.37">This interaction with the math teacher, it lasts 11 seconds. She locks her eyes on Maricela, Maricela shakes her head. And then another kid jumps in front of the teacher, and the room of 25 people moves forward.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Teacher 3</h4><p begin="00:58:12.56" data-timestamp="3492.56"> So I'm going to give you a question.

OK?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:58:22.76" data-timestamp="3502.76"> School is a machine that is designed to move forward. Kids move class-to-class, grade-to-grade. The machine does not stop. It's not designed to go back in time, to meet Maricela where she's at right now, which is at the back of the classroom, hiding behind a backpack, as her classmates enthusiastically compete to solve a math equation.</p><p begin="00:58:44.94" data-timestamp="3524.94">[STUDENTS YELLING EXCITEDLY]</p><p begin="00:58:47.43" data-timestamp="3527.43"></p><p begin="00:58:50.93" data-timestamp="3530.93">Out of all the awkward moments I saw that day, this one was the hardest to watch, because you can feel the conveyor belt of school moving forward. I could see Maricela's panic that she could not figure out how to jump on.</p><p begin="00:59:10.65" data-timestamp="3550.65">And then, I see her try. Right before lunch, Maricela's standing in the hallway nervously digging through her backpack, other kids streaming past her to the lunch tables outside.</p><p begin="00:59:25.99" data-timestamp="3565.99">And then, all of a sudden, she calls out to another kid.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:59:30.06" data-timestamp="3570.06"> Arecilli, mira.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:59:32.21" data-timestamp="3572.21"> She says, Arecilli, look, and opens up her bag. Arecilli is a tall, quiet girl in pink, who's been moving through the whole day in a pack of three-- three girls who, I'm told, have all recently arrived at the school from Mexico. Maricela starts showing Arecilli all the candy, and snacks, and lotion in her backpack.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maricela</h4><p begin="00:59:52.22" data-timestamp="3592.22"> Oh, look, and I have these.

[LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="01:00:02.34" data-timestamp="3602.34"> Now, the three girls are all leaning in over her backpack, giggling and slowly moving through the hall toward lunch up ahead of me. And a sixth-grader quickly replaces Maricela at my side, tells me she's been on TV, so I might recognize her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Student</h4><p begin="01:00:16.38" data-timestamp="3616.38"> Have you seen a commercial where a dad's fixing a purple Jeep with his daughter?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="01:00:20.34" data-timestamp="3620.34"> No. Is that you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Student</h4><p begin="01:00:21.63" data-timestamp="3621.63"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="01:00:22.47" data-timestamp="3622.47"> You're the daughter?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Student</h4><p begin="01:00:23.25" data-timestamp="3623.25"> Yeah.

They can't be as close, because Maricela missed most of middle school. And middle school is almost over. She can't go back to sixth-grade math, just like she can't go back to her apartment.</p><p begin="01:02:07.19" data-timestamp="3727.19">And she definitely can't go back to Valeria.

What happens if they don't fit back in?</p><p begin="01:03:38.40" data-timestamp="3818.4">Maricela has been coming to school for six months now, but she doesn't always come. Her attendance is pretty spotty. Principal Vanessa Garza tells me Maricela is now three grades behind, but she will be promoted to ninth grade.</p><p begin="01:03:52.32" data-timestamp="3832.32">She won't be able to walk at graduation because of the attendance issues, but Ms. Vanessa thinks the shame of being held back would be the end of school for Maricela. And she has a better shot of finishing high school, if she can start earning credits toward graduation now. She'll keep moving forward.</p><p begin="01:04:09.60" data-timestamp="3849.6">I asked Maricela if she likes being back in school.
