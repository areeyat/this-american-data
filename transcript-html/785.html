Like, maybe we should leave.</p><p begin="00:04:44.79" data-timestamp="284.79">And at first, they're on the same page.

It seems so dangerous. Today, on our program, we have people trying to sweet-talk each other across that line, with reason and with guile and with whatever they got. It's such an act of faith in each other even to try-- kind of inspiring, really. From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass.

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:43.03" data-timestamp="583.03"> Act 1, Flies, Meet Honey. So this woman, Aubree, has been calling elections administrators all over Texas for nearly two years. And as a case study of people trying to coax others over to their side, it's not going too well.</p><p begin="00:10:00.25" data-timestamp="600.25">She questions them, accuses them. There's one call I want to play a little bit of-- kind of, sums things up. At the beginning of the call, the official is very calm, saying things like--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Official</h4><p begin="00:10:10.24" data-timestamp="610.24"> Aubree, you brought up a lot of things, so I wanted to tackle them one by one.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:14.20" data-timestamp="614.2"> But pretty quickly, Aubree is asking him about things that he can't comment on, because they're the subject of lawsuits. Lawyers have told them not to talk about them publicly. But Aubree-- she doesn't accept that. She keeps pushing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aubree Campbell</h4><p begin="00:10:26.53" data-timestamp="626.53"> Your county attorneys-- they don't want you to give information to the voters?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Official</h4><p begin="00:10:31.54" data-timestamp="631.54"> All I'm telling you is, I'm following their advice, Aubree. And I look forward to a time when I'm able to talk more freely about this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aubree Campbell</h4><p begin="00:10:38.47" data-timestamp="638.47"> So you're not able to talk freely about the issues in the elections, because one part of it has been filed with a court of law?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Official</h4><p begin="00:10:44.16" data-timestamp="644.16"> Aubree, did you not understand what I said earlier, when I said I'm not?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aubree Campbell</h4><p begin="00:10:46.87" data-timestamp="646.87"> I do not. Could you help me understand--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Official</h4><p begin="00:10:48.29" data-timestamp="648.29"> I think I've spoken clearly and in English that I have, that I can't speak about this, because of the current and ongoing litigation.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:54.40" data-timestamp="654.4"> As you can hear, this gets hotter and hotter. He's an elections administrator in a county in central Texas and has had years of Stop the Stealers now, questioning him like this. They flood elections offices with records requests. They sue.</p><p begin="00:11:08.56" data-timestamp="668.56">Before long in this call, Aubree is quoting Texas legal code that she believes mandates that all ballots in Texas should be pre-numbered sequentially, starting at one, which isn't done today, with computers counting votes. And the elections administrator snaps.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Official</h4><p begin="00:11:23.92" data-timestamp="683.92"> What else would you like to quote, chapter and verse incorrectly?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aubree Campbell</h4><p begin="00:11:25.84" data-timestamp="685.84"> OK, sure. Sure. So you're sitting in violation of the state and national constitutions, because the--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Official</h4><p begin="00:11:30.82" data-timestamp="690.82"> Incorrect. Wrong. Next.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aubree Campbell</h4><p begin="00:11:33.10" data-timestamp="693.1"> Let me finish, sir. The Secretary of State does not have the authority to circumvent Texas election code, 52--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Official</h4><p begin="00:11:38.04" data-timestamp="698.04"> You're mistaken. You're mistaken.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aubree Campbell</h4><p begin="00:11:39.74" data-timestamp="699.74"> No, I'm not.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Official</h4><p begin="00:11:40.24" data-timestamp="700.24"> I don't even have to let you finish. I can tell you right now, off the bat, you're mistaken. Next.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aubree Campbell</h4><p begin="00:11:45.19" data-timestamp="705.19"> Can you tell me the election code that you can cite, that allows you to circumvent the 52.062 and 62.009?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Official</h4><p begin="00:11:51.67" data-timestamp="711.67"> Request denied.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aubree Campbell</h4><p begin="00:11:52.21" data-timestamp="712.21"> You don't know it off the top of your head like I do? But you don't know the codes in the law off the top of your head?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Official</h4><p begin="00:11:57.14" data-timestamp="717.14"> I don't.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aubree Campbell</h4><p begin="00:11:57.79" data-timestamp="717.79"> OK. Do you-- have you read-- have you read the national--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Official</h4><p begin="00:12:00.43" data-timestamp="720.43"> I'm pretty smart. Pretty smart.

And here's how I'm going to refuse that-- by the coming phone click that you're about to hear in 3, 2, 1.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:35.69" data-timestamp="755.69"> Because of these kinds of encounters between elections officials and activists, it gets very personal sometimes. In the last few years in Texas, lots of election administrators have quit or retired. The entire staff of an elections office in Gillespie County quit at the same time, because of accusations of fraud, obscene, racist emails, threats.</p><p begin="00:12:55.67" data-timestamp="775.67">People call the cops on these officials and try to get them arrested while they're doing their jobs. But there is another path. That woman, Aubree Campbell, that you just heard-- she happens to live in a county in Texas-- Tarrant County, where the elections administrator is not the guy who you just heard on the phone.</p><p begin="00:13:12.88" data-timestamp="792.88">The official in Tarrant County is this singular, kind of, remarkable figure. We learned about him from Natalia Contreras, who's been reporting on elections in Texas for months now, for <i>Votebeat,</i> which covers all this in depth around the country. Natalia says, there's really nobody else like him that she's been able to find.</p><p begin="00:13:31.90" data-timestamp="811.9">He's very effective, for some special reasons that Natalia will explain in a bit. His name is Heider Garcia. And watching him, it's hard not to feel like if anybody could convince the election doubters that our elections can be trusted-- or at the very least, if anybody can make headway with them, it would be this guy.</p><p begin="00:13:50.98" data-timestamp="830.98">And to try to see how successful he is in winning over the election skeptics and the Stop the Stealers, and to see the limits of that success. Earlier this month, on election day, Natalia and Zoe Chace from our staff co-reported a story where the two of them followed Heider around as he managed the election in Tarrant County and as he dealt with the election doubters-- and Aubree, in particular. Here are Natalia and Zoe.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Natalia Contreras</h4><p begin="00:14:16.70" data-timestamp="856.7"> Let's start with Aubree. She's just one of many people in Texas who have made it almost their full-time job to challenge election officials.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:14:25.62" data-timestamp="865.62"> And they all have some kind of story like this to explain how they got into it. In Tarrant County, when Joe Biden won, it didn't really make any sense to Aubree. It's a Republican county. Republicans won down the ballot. But the president-- somehow, Biden won.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aubree Campbell</h4><p begin="00:14:40.44" data-timestamp="880.44"> Then, when Biden took Tarrant County, we were really upset, because Trump has a lot of vocal support here, and I don't know a single Democrat. And none of my Democrat friends voted for Biden in the primaries. They all voted for Bernie. So you talk to him one on one, they know something's not right.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Natalia Contreras</h4><p begin="00:14:55.32" data-timestamp="895.32"> Aubree doesn't look like other activists I see in this world, who are mostly elderly and retired. She's 33, but looks way younger. She's white, petite, round, hipstery eyeglasses, leather jacket. She describes herself as a conservative metal head. She stands out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heider Garcia</h4><p begin="00:15:13.74" data-timestamp="913.74"> It was post-2020, because I remember the whole thing started with her interacting with an election judge.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Natalia Contreras</h4><p begin="00:15:20.61" data-timestamp="920.61"> This is Heider Garcia.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heider Garcia</h4><p begin="00:15:22.05" data-timestamp="922.05"> She was really frustrated. She took out her cell phone, started recording the poll worker, saying, you're obstructing me from voting. The poll worker said, you can't use your phone here, and the whole situation started to happen. And that's when I started interacting with her, and, you know.</p><p begin="00:15:37.37" data-timestamp="937.37">[RATTLING NOISE]</p><p begin="00:15:39.71" data-timestamp="939.71"></p><p begin="00:15:39.94" data-timestamp="939.94">Coffee?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:15:41.98" data-timestamp="941.98"> It's 6:30 AM on election day. Heider Garcia is the kind of person who carries around his own coffee grinder to grind his own beans for his morning coffee. Fastidious? Neurotic? He has high standards for himself and his coffee.</p><p begin="00:15:58.25" data-timestamp="958.25">He oversees every aspect of the election with the same fastidiousness. He sets the whole thing up. He trains the workers. He tells us he's been working on not being a micromanager, which you only say if you are.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Natalia Contreras</h4><p begin="00:16:11.51" data-timestamp="971.51"> Heider's taking a particular approach with people like Aubree. It's something I haven't seen any other Texas election officials do. His strategy is to go as far as humanly possible to answer every question and address every suspicion. He treats everything they say like it's worthy of an answer.</p><p begin="00:16:31.22" data-timestamp="991.22">It's like radical patience. And when you see him do it, you see why other officials don't. Because it takes hours. It's a big part of his job now, on top of all the work of running an election.</p><p begin="00:16:44.33" data-timestamp="1004.33">They call with some issue. He's like, come in. Let me walk you through it. Let me show you around. Here's a typical example.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heider Garcia</h4><p begin="00:16:51.17" data-timestamp="1011.17"> So there was this one time when one of our watchers came in, and he was like, you know, if I-- he was in a tally room with us, and he said-- this was back in-- I think it was last year. If I were in charge here, I would make all the walls in this room glass, so that you could see where every cable goes, and you could be totally transparent-- something like that.</p><p begin="00:17:10.25" data-timestamp="1030.25">And I looked at him and said, why do you want that? He says, well, because we should know where every wire goes, so we can know if you're connected to the internet or not. And I said, well, but the whole point is to show that the machines are not connected to the internet, right?</p><p begin="00:17:21.08" data-timestamp="1041.08">We're talking about the servers and the tally room, so there shouldn't be any cable going in the machine. So I told him, what about if we rearrange the room, so the machines are not, like, in this little cabinet under the desk, but up where you can see them and you can-- he said, well, maybe that would be a start.</p><p begin="00:17:33.92" data-timestamp="1053.92">So the next election, they came back in a runoff. You know, when they walked in the room, I told them, all the machines are on top of the tables. You can see the back. They're against the glass.</p><p begin="00:17:41.33" data-timestamp="1061.33">They're labeled what each one of them does. This is what you wanted, right? And so he had that moment of, again, OK, well, you got me on that one. And it's little things like that, that we keep doing, right?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:17:54.38" data-timestamp="1074.38"> In theory, any election official could go this far-- answer every question-- if they wanted to. Though, in some ways, Heider's uniquely suited for this, he's a computer engineer. He's designed voting machines.</p><p begin="00:18:07.38" data-timestamp="1087.38">So he can answer, in detail, any question, technical or not, in a way few officials ever can. And for this election morning, as people are going out to vote, he's rigged up his office like some kind of air traffic control tower. It's a big room, and he's installed this enormous screen in it, and we're looking at every polling place marked on a huge Google map-- 316 of them.</p><p begin="00:18:31.31" data-timestamp="1111.31">They're all color-coded with wait times. If there's a problem at a polling place, the color changes to mark the level of urgency-- low, medium, critical. Then, on a separate map, Heider can see, if a tech is dispatched to fix something, he can watch them travel out there on the map, like an Uber. We can see how long it's going to take. Not long after the polls open, around 8 AM, he gets a call.</p><p begin="00:18:54.25" data-timestamp="1134.25">[KNOCKING ON DOOR]</p><p begin="00:18:55.18" data-timestamp="1135.18">[PHONE RINGING]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Natalia Contreras</h4><p begin="00:18:58.00" data-timestamp="1138"> Heider holds up the phone to me.

People shared his home address online.</p><p begin="00:24:56.83" data-timestamp="1496.83">And suddenly local activists in Texas had this hometown supervillain to investigate, and talk about, and publicize. People made their own videos. Aubree made one that's two hours long. It's called Heider Smartmatic Garcia, and it included a lot of inaccurate information about his time with Smartmatic.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aubree Campbell</h4><p begin="00:25:15.37" data-timestamp="1515.37"> He sold their machines to the legislature of the Philippines. So not only did he design the machines, I mean, this guy is a real go-getter. He also went out and sold it to the Philippines, who later had a big, big issue with them. We'll flip over and watch that video in just a moment. He was also--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Natalia Contreras</h4><p begin="00:25:38.34" data-timestamp="1538.34"> At some point, Heider decided he had nothing to hide. He didn't do anything wrong. He went on the offensive, submitted testimony to Congress, threatened to sue Aubree for defamation. She put out an apology video.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aubree Campbell</h4><p begin="00:25:51.78" data-timestamp="1551.78"> OK, I have to issue what I guess you could call a retraction.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:26:02.17" data-timestamp="1562.17"> I just want to be clear. Aubree is not some big, famous internet activist. She has fewer than 1,000 followers. She works in restaurants. She's part of this whole world of people out there on Telegram and stuff like that, since the election sharing their own analysis of what they think is election fraud-- probably sincerely, and asking for donations. What makes Heider so mad about Aubree and some others is he sees it like she's using this narrative of him that she's fighting this big, bad Venezuelan operative to build up her own brand.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:26:36.37" data-timestamp="1596.37"> Does she sell merchandise?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heider Garcia</h4><p begin="00:26:37.65" data-timestamp="1597.65"> Yep.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:26:39.67" data-timestamp="1599.67"> What does she sell?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heider Garcia</h4><p begin="00:26:41.38" data-timestamp="1601.38"> That stuff there.

Aubree says she doesn't sell much merch, and she doesn't ask for donations much either. The merch reads "Taking Back Texas," which is Aubree's brand.</p><p begin="00:26:58.90" data-timestamp="1618.9">Oh, that is a lot of merch.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Natalia Contreras</h4><p begin="00:27:08.24" data-timestamp="1628.24"> Throughout the morning, Heider's constantly running back and forth, checking in on the people managing the phone bank, to the point where one of them literally says to him, Heider, I need to focus now. His phone keeps blowing up with calls about minor technical issues, machines going down at polling places.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heider Garcia</h4><p begin="00:27:25.67" data-timestamp="1645.67"> Arlington, Miller-- that's the hot spot right now. I've got calls from both sides on that one.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:27:33.23" data-timestamp="1653.23"> There's other types of problems-- people problems. One poll worker, while demonstrating how to help voters vote, accidentally voted as someone else with a similar name. There's a problem with the poll judge-- well, with the alternate to the judge.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heider Garcia</h4><p begin="00:27:49.31" data-timestamp="1669.31"> Question-- I do have one for you. Judge called and said she thinks her alternate has been drinking and is carrying-- [LAUGHS] --and carrying, and carrying. And apparently he said something like, I'm carrying, and I'm here to protect you if necessary. And she said she smelled alcohol. So we're going to tell him to call law enforcement and have them assess the situation.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:28:15.31" data-timestamp="1695.31"> Mostly Heider's upbeat, excited, jokey. When his assistant Troy brags about how he's about to buy an F-150 hybrid, Heider's like, can you not drive it to work right after the election? People are going to be like, see, they got that big George Soros payout-- your "Ford Soros," he says.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Natalia Contreras</h4><p begin="00:28:41.67" data-timestamp="1721.67"> Heider's phone rings.

Usually it's no big deal, but now everyone is suspicious they're being targeted.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heider Garcia</h4><p begin="00:29:13.61" data-timestamp="1753.61"> No, Brookside did have an issue. There was a tech dispatched there a while ago. They should be on-site, actually, right now. Yeah, nothing's not going to not get serviced. That'd be the stupidest mistake I can make. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aubree Campbell</h4><p begin="00:29:27.50" data-timestamp="1767.5"> All right, so do you have a lot of other locations where the controllers or the tabulator went down?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heider Garcia</h4><p begin="00:29:32.84" data-timestamp="1772.84"> I think a grapevine in the library-- they had two strings and one of them had an issue-- and Miller. I think that one was a scanner. But that's not a problem, because they can still vote. They just put them in the emergency bin on the board. Ballot board adds them in once we get it back here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aubree Campbell</h4><p begin="00:29:49.49" data-timestamp="1789.49"> Oh, yeah, they're going to throw a fit about that though.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Natalia Contreras</h4><p begin="00:29:53.54" data-timestamp="1793.54"> This happened on a huge scale in Arizona, and people did throw a fit about it. Aubree tells Heider she's going to go check it out for herself.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heider Garcia</h4><p begin="00:30:01.73" data-timestamp="1801.73"> I don't care if you call me 100 times a day, because I'd rather hear as soon as I can and get on it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:30:06.89" data-timestamp="1806.89"> It's almost like he's deputized her. Sometimes they seem like colleagues. I can't tell whose strategy that is, or whether it's working, but it seems to calm things. In the end, the broken scanner wasn't a big deal.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Natalia Contreras</h4><p begin="00:30:28.93" data-timestamp="1828.93"> Finally, when we get near 7:00 when polls will close, poll watchers start piling in from voting sites around the county. Not as many as we had expected. When Aubree walks in, her first question is about Heider.</p><p begin="00:30:41.95" data-timestamp="1841.95">"Do you know where he is?" she says to someone. "He probably doesn't want me walking around here too much on my own."

And to move that USB drive into the tally room where they'll be added to the results, the drive is lifted high into the air for all watchers to see and marched like a winning quarterback into the next room.

She's in a red, white, and blue dress with a clipboard, scrutinizing the way the ballot bags are sealed. Mike, he's a retired air mechanic who says, if we can audit planes, why can't we do better with elections here? He's there. Karen, she has a lawsuit against Heider.</p><p begin="00:32:49.57" data-timestamp="1969.57">There's maybe a dozen people he deals with regularly, like Aubree. He knows all of these people well, and he's trying to anticipate what they'll want. And does it work? Are they satisfied?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aubree Campbell</h4><p begin="00:33:02.26" data-timestamp="1982.26"> I will say this, Heider makes other election administrators look like idiots.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Natalia Contreras</h4><p begin="00:33:08.29" data-timestamp="1988.29"> Again, here's Aubree.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aubree Campbell</h4><p begin="00:33:09.70" data-timestamp="1989.7"> Well, he'll answer all your questions, so we're getting places.

I do not trust the system. But it's helped me understand the system more.</p><p begin="00:33:42.34" data-timestamp="2022.34">Trust it? No. I don't trust computerized voting systems.

Whether that's happening right now, we're unable to fully investigate.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:33:54.59" data-timestamp="2034.59"> Even after everything Heider's done to convince her otherwise, she doesn't believe the process is secure enough in Tarrant County to say for sure that the votes were accurately counted. This past year I've wondered, can you convince someone that an election is not stolen?</p><p begin="00:34:10.31" data-timestamp="2050.31">And what I realized watching Heider is, that is not the right question to ask right now. That's an endpoint we're not going to arrive at. The activists aren't going away. Instead, what Heider is trying, he's integrating the election skeptics and all their questions into the elections office and the way it works.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heider Garcia</h4><p begin="00:34:29.78" data-timestamp="2069.78"> It's the job. Maybe there's no point. Maybe that's just the job. You know, maybe there's no endgame. Maybe that's just the way it is.</p><p begin="00:34:38.39" data-timestamp="2078.39">Like I said, if there is a shooting, police jumps into it. If there was a fire, a firefighter. [INAUDIBLE] questions, that's ours. Not because it's going to end, because it's your job. It's your job, it's simple.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Natalia Contreras</h4><p begin="00:34:51.03" data-timestamp="2091.03"> And in this new normal on this election night, the job's gone as well as he could hope. The activists still have their doubts, a few of them already setting up meetings with Heider for later that week. There's a new conspiracy every day.</p><p begin="00:35:04.92" data-timestamp="2104.92">But no one yells. No one throws a fit saying they're being obstructed. And Heider rushes around to everyone, like the anxious owner of a restaurant, checking on their regulars, making sure they have everything they need. And the votes get counted.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:35:29.59" data-timestamp="2129.59"> Natalia Contreras is a reporter with Votebeat.

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:36:06.02" data-timestamp="2166.02"> We have arrived at Act Two of our show. Act Two, Who is Ryan Long?</p><p begin="00:36:12.00" data-timestamp="2172">So in this story you're going to see a guy trying to actually coax himself through the looking glass from one reality into another. Lots of people actually saw him do this. One of our producers, Bim Adewunmi, was one of them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:36:24.95" data-timestamp="2184.95"> Back in May, I became mildly obsessed with a stranger on TV. It was a big guy. He looked Black, biracial maybe, and he was wearing a light purple shirt under a black vest.</p><p begin="00:36:36.29" data-timestamp="2196.29">I was ill on my sofa. It was 7:00 PM on a Friday. You know what that means.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Johnny Gilbert</h4><p begin="00:36:42.08" data-timestamp="2202.08"> This is <i>Jeopardy!</i> Introducing today's contestants, a rideshare driver from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Ryan Long.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:36:54.27" data-timestamp="2214.27"> A rideshare driver. I watch a lot of <i>Jeopardy,</i> but if you don't, you might not know that it is not that common among all the professors and the grad students and other learned contestants to see an Uber driver. Also unusual in my years of watching-- big Black guys.</p><p begin="00:37:11.76" data-timestamp="2231.76">Ryan won that first game, and then he kept on winning. In the end, he won almost $300,000 over 16 games, becoming the ninth winningest <i>Jeopardy</i> winner of all time. After pretty much every win, he would do this thing that I began to look forward to. He'd grip the lectern, look down, almost defiantly refusing to meet the host's eye, and shake his head. His body language basically screamed "this can't be real, this is impossible."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mayim Bialik</h4><p begin="00:37:40.71" data-timestamp="2260.71"> Ryan, congratulations! With $18,800, you are our new <i>Jeopardy</i> champion.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:37:46.89" data-timestamp="2266.89"> I took a photo of Ryan on my TV screen that first night he won, and posted it to Instagram. "You have my sword," I captioned the photo, a line from "The Lord of the Rings."</p><p begin="00:37:57.90" data-timestamp="2277.9">Here's a thing about me-- I love trivia. I was a childhood library lurker who hoarded facts, just waiting to bust them out and impress people. I love remembering dates and locations, and I delight in wordplay.</p><p begin="00:38:11.91" data-timestamp="2291.91">Watching Ryan win again and again reminded me of myself a little, except he was me to the power of 100. It sounds condescending and weird, because we're about the same age, in our very late 30s, but I was proud of him, I think.</p><p begin="00:38:26.91" data-timestamp="2306.91">I rarely feel affection for <i>Jeopardy</i> winners. They're too mannered, too serious, too odd. But I was rooting for Ryan. I felt like I knew him.</p><p begin="00:38:37.05" data-timestamp="2317.05">He had tweeted after his winning run something that stuck with me, something about a box. "Sometimes," he wrote, "it seems like society put you in a box and you are classified as a certain thing, with a certain destiny, even though you may feel differently inside."</p><p begin="00:38:58.81" data-timestamp="2338.81">I wondered how somebody who felt so familiar to me had ended up dominating the <i>Jeopardy</i> stage. What was that like for him? What box did he think he was in, and how had <i>Jeopardy</i> helped him break out of it?</p><p begin="00:39:11.56" data-timestamp="2351.56">Honestly, I just wanted to meet him. And so, along with my colleague and co-Ryan fan, Zoe Chace, I got on a train to Philadelphia. He met us in his new truck at the station.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:39:22.68" data-timestamp="2362.68"> Hi, Ryan.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:39:22.99" data-timestamp="2362.99"> Which, by the way, we knew immediately that was Ryan's car. It still has that new car gleam, and it is huge-- exactly the car you would expect from a man whose happy place is his car. Even before he became a rideshare driver, he would spend hours driving around navigating the potholes of Philly with his music on. So Zoe and I ended up spending all day on the road with him and meeting a couple of his friends. And the first question from Ryan felt like something you might ask a friend.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ryan Long</h4><p begin="00:39:51.34" data-timestamp="2391.34"> All right, let's start off with a weird question.

Plus, he was also in the midst of working out his mixed identity back then. His mom is Black and his father was white. And on top of that, he was an obviously smart kid. So they put him in the gifted classes, which also made him feel a little isolated.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ryan Long</h4><p begin="00:42:14.17" data-timestamp="2534.17"> I was smart and stupid at the same time.

I would just stay quiet. Because I would have an opinion on a topic or something like that, and I was afraid that it would go over the other kids' heads and they would look at me like I got three eyes or something. So I would just keep my mouth shut. You feel like you got to fit in.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:42:54.04" data-timestamp="2574.04"> This was his first understanding that people have ideas about you, and those ideas might not match how you feel about yourself. It was also the first time Ryan felt put into that box that he tweeted about. And in order to fit, he had to cut parts of himself off.</p><p begin="00:43:09.91" data-timestamp="2589.91">In the end, Ryan didn't do great at school. His parents had split up when he was 13, and he'd gone to live with his dad. A few years later, when he was 17, his father died and Ryan moved back in with his mom.</p><p begin="00:43:23.08" data-timestamp="2603.08">According to Ryan, he barely graduated high school, and then did a year of community college before dropping out. It's like he got so used to hiding away the brightest parts of himself, that he got really good at it-- too good. The way Ryan tells it, he settled into the role of underachiever, and that made him prone to self-sabotage.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ryan Long</h4><p begin="00:43:44.83" data-timestamp="2624.83"> It'll be something like a subconscious thing where I know I got an important meeting or something, I got to be somewhere. And my brain, I'll have this urge to just, "you know what, just roll over."</p><p begin="00:44:01.00" data-timestamp="2641">Instead of getting up because I know it's important, it's like, "Just roll over. Whatever. It doesn't mean that much. You don't need this. It's not that important. You don't want it."</p><p begin="00:44:10.57" data-timestamp="2650.57">And I'll oversleep, or I'll be late, or won't show up, something like that. It happens a lot, especially for things that could potentially benefit me. Because some part of me is either "this is stupid" or "you don't deserve it" or something. And I'm pretty sure that's depression.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:44:32.20" data-timestamp="2672.2"> For all the potential of his big brain, Ryan had the feeling that life was slipping him by. And when he became a father in his 30s, the question of lost potential became moot. He needed money to live and to provide, so he did all sorts of jobs-- airport security worker, warehouse grunt, package handler, office clerk.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ryan Long</h4><p begin="00:44:53.56" data-timestamp="2693.56"> Piano mover, water ice guy, worked at UPS, was a cashier, was a bouncer, was a street sweeper for a couple of weeks. You got to do what you got to do, right?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:45:06.22" data-timestamp="2706.22"> But then in January 2021, Ryan got sick with COVID. He had it really bad, and was in hospital for three weeks. He had to be given oxygen to stay alive. And he still has the photo of his saturated lungs, given to him by his doctor as a reminder of how close he came to death.</p><p begin="00:45:24.22" data-timestamp="2724.22">When he was discharged, he was a wreck. His knee gave out and he got diabetes. More than 20 years of the working grind seemed to catch up to him all at once.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ryan Long</h4><p begin="00:45:34.51" data-timestamp="2734.51"> I felt in the moment like I'd wasted my life thus far. I hadn't done anything I wanted to do. I hadn't gone anywhere that I wanted to go. I started feeling like maybe I didn't have a huge amount of time left.</p><p begin="00:45:50.62" data-timestamp="2750.62">My dad died young. His dad died young. I didn't want to have to do that to my kid. I found my dad dead. I thought, if you're going to have a memory of me, have a good one.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:46:08.80" data-timestamp="2768.8"> Getting COVID and surviving it was, in Ryan's own words, "a rockfall that turned into a landslide." It made him want to get out of his old habit of minimizing himself, this urge to snatch defeats from the jaws of victory.</p><p begin="00:46:23.68" data-timestamp="2783.68">That's when he got the call from <i>Jeopardy.</i> He'd taken the online test on a whim. And now, Ryan thought, this could be the thing he'd been hoping would come along to shake things up.</p><p begin="00:46:35.08" data-timestamp="2795.08">That question I'd had about his journey to <i>Jeopardy,</i> it turns out the literal trip was a joint effort. He had about $200 to spare that month, and he had to make his own way to California. So he turned to his mom and his friends. He borrowed his mother's luggage and packed some black trousers plus two shirts-- one he'd bought himself, and the other bought by his mom.</p><p begin="00:46:57.77" data-timestamp="2817.77">Remember how he made the decision as a teenager to hide his light under a bushel so he could be more normal? Now he was making another decision-- this time the guy whose tendency was to downplay his intelligence and his abilities was not going to get in his own way.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ryan Long</h4><p begin="00:47:13.63" data-timestamp="2833.63"> The work was on me where I had to first acknowledge that I wanted it, give myself permission to want it. And say, OK, we're going to do this thing and we're going to do it right and we're not going to screw it up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:47:28.90" data-timestamp="2848.9"> He got on the plane to California. He'd never been off the east coast in his life. He was determined to enjoy himself. And he told himself, no expectations. Unlike some other wannabe winners, he did no tutorials on technique, no arduous studying.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ryan Long</h4><p begin="00:47:44.53" data-timestamp="2864.53"> These are people that all year long they study, buying books on the buzzer technique and all that. When I've found out that people did that, [LAUGHS] I felt like, oh, should I have studied? I guess, maybe.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:48:01.39" data-timestamp="2881.39"> You didn't pick up "The Big Book of <i>Jeopardy</i> Questions?"</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ryan Long</h4><p begin="00:48:03.52" data-timestamp="2883.52"> I didn't have time.

I was working up until right before I left.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:48:10.33" data-timestamp="2890.33"> On the day of his first game Ryan felt overwhelmed, but he worked through it. He let himself cry, which was an effective release valve for some of the emotional turmoil he was feeling. And then he pumped himself up with some music. Once he felt more in control, he headed to the studio to the show he'd watched since he was a little boy in Philly.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ryan Long</h4><p begin="00:48:30.79" data-timestamp="2910.79"> Felt like hallowed ground-- <i>Jeopardy,</i> the stage.

He laughed at himself when he flubbed the Daily Double, or realized he had bet too low on an easy answer. He delivered his cute little anecdotes in the "getting to know you" segments. But once the game was won, that easy grace was gone.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mayim Bialik</h4><p begin="00:49:37.07" data-timestamp="2977.07"> Congratulations, you are our <i>Jeopardy</i> champion.

He was a challenger of Ryan's, also a Philly local. The two of them stayed friends after the show. They even had a little watch party at Brad's house the night his episode aired.</p><p begin="00:50:32.11" data-timestamp="3032.11">Over cheesesteaks, he told us about playing against Ryan in his fifth game. Contestants get to watch preceding games before they tape theirs. And all eyes were on Ryan, the returning champ, game after game. Brad was sitting with Tony, another of the pool of challengers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brad Pearson</h4><p begin="00:50:48.88" data-timestamp="3048.88"> As the day progressed, Tony turns to me at one point during the third game, and he goes, "He's only getting stronger!"</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:50:54.99" data-timestamp="3054.99"> [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:50:57.28" data-timestamp="3057.28"> Brad noted the same thing I did-- that Ryan was a real all-rounder, banging out answers to everything from biblical locations, to the alumni of <i>Saturday</i> <i>Night</i> <i>Live.</i></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brad Pearson</h4><p begin="00:51:08.86" data-timestamp="3068.86"> When I think of Ryan as a player, the thing is that you find certain people that are good at some really specific stuff.

It's like the glare of praise was too bright for his eyes. He couldn't look directly at it. He did something similar when his mom bragged about him, and again when his friend Mari, who we also met, mentioned how great of a guy he was.</p><p begin="00:51:43.63" data-timestamp="3103.63">His face got all scrunched up, like it physically pained him to hear. But even so, over the course of his games, he beat contestants with far more impressive on-paper CVs. Even after winning, he knew that he wasn't seen as a typical <i>Jeopardy</i> winner.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ryan Long</h4><p begin="00:51:59.38" data-timestamp="3119.38"> I don't look smart, whatever that means.

But, he added, I feel like this thing that just happened is proof that you can. And I wondered what he'd found outside of the box since he had managed to get out.</p><p begin="00:53:01.49" data-timestamp="3181.49">Returning to Philly, it was hard for Ryan to know how to act. His episodes wouldn't be on television for another few weeks. It was like he had to pretend something monumental hadn't just happened to him.</p><p begin="00:53:21.72" data-timestamp="3201.72">There's no way to talk about Ryan's time on the show without talking about the money he won. $299,400 is quite the windfall. He no longer works as a rideshare driver, having paid off his old car and bought this new truck.</p><p begin="00:53:37.56" data-timestamp="3217.56">On the advice of his mom, he met up with a couple of people from a community improvement group for advice about what to do with this new earnings.

So what is your life now?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ryan Long</h4><p begin="00:55:58.86" data-timestamp="3358.86"> It allowed me the opportunity to have time to do this, which I wouldn't have had time to do anyway.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:56:05.77" data-timestamp="3365.77"> What's this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ryan Long</h4><p begin="00:56:07.08" data-timestamp="3367.08"> It-- examine myself, I guess.

I think everybody needs to do it, but not everybody has time to do it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:56:26.76" data-timestamp="3386.76"> So that's the biggest <i>post-Jeopardy</i> change is just an abundance of time for you now?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ryan Long</h4><p begin="00:56:32.98" data-timestamp="3392.98"> Yeah.

But I also got this accidental reflection on American capitalism, and how so many of us are served so poorly by the way life is currently set up as all work and no time. <i>Jeopardy</i> provided a very specific Ryan-shaped escape hatch. It gave him the space to stare into that crack between realities, and fish out all the elements of what his life could be.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:34.88" data-timestamp="3454.88"> Bim Adewunmi is one of the producers of our show.</p></div>  </div>
