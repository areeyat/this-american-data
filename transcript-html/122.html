  <h3>Act One: Meet The Ball And Chain</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.13" data-timestamp="0.13">When Anne met Charles, they were not supposed to fall in love. It was forbidden that they fall in love. Capulets and Montagues, Jets and Sharks, David Addison and Mattie Hayes on <i>Moonlighting,</i> Scully and Mulder, <i>Anna Karenina,</i> you know the story. The day they met, she was a nurse in the Texas prisons. He was a prisoner, support service inmate. First day on her new assignment, working in the infirmary.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:00:20.92" data-timestamp="20.92">They're called SSIs, which is a janitor service there. And there was four new ones came in that day. And they come bebopping down through the hall and started to the back of the infirmary. And I ask them just where they thought they were going. He says, &quot;Honey, you did take my head off a time or two that day.&quot; So that was the first time I'd ever seen him.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:43.42" data-timestamp="43.42">Was this the kind of thing where the first time you looked at him, you thought, &quot;Huh, wonder who that is.&quot;</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:00:48.16" data-timestamp="48.16">No, no.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:51.94" data-timestamp="51.94">She'd see him around, mopping, clearing out trash. And then, as always happens in these kinds of stories, fate threw them together, together in a situation where it was the two of them against the world.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:01:05.37" data-timestamp="65.37">We worked together for a couple of months and then got into a situation that involved some real sticky stuff that I'd really rather not get real specific about. But he told me some information about some stuff that had taken place while I was out of the infirmary one evening. By the time I got through facing off people, it brought a lot of heat on both of us.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:38.42" data-timestamp="98.42">And did the two of you actually blow the whistle on somebody in a way that officers got disciplined and punished?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:01:46.76" data-timestamp="106.76">We blew the whistle, yes. The officer got a promotion instead of getting disciplined. They basically totally isolated us both, because I took the word of an inmate over that of an officer. And they don't like that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:06.63" data-timestamp="126.63">And nobody talked to the two of you? And so did that mean that you ended up having a lot of time alone with each other?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:02:12.95" data-timestamp="132.95">Well, it ended up being we were the only two to talk to. We talked to each other. And I really got to know what kind of a person that he was, and that he will stand up for truth when other people will skirt around it. But he will face what's coming down, just so that the truth comes out, at great personal risk to him.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:44.61" data-timestamp="164.61">Still, his crime?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:02:46.10" data-timestamp="166.1">He was in for murder. He killed a man that raped his niece. And he's been given 25 years for that.</p><p begin="00:02:59.78" data-timestamp="179.78">It's drilled in our head all the time. Anyone that works there, it's drilled in your head that these people are out to con you. They're going to pull something on you. They're going to blackmail you into doing something. This is the prison system's way of looking at things.</p><p begin="00:03:17.27" data-timestamp="197.27">But not everyone that's inside the prison system is that way. That was one of my major problems, is I could not understand, and I could not treat them like they were animals. I just couldn't do it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:41.13" data-timestamp="221.13">Well, from WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio International, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Today in our program, for Valentine's Day, stories of forbidden love.</p><p begin="00:03:51.47" data-timestamp="231.47">Act One, Meet the Ball and Chain. What happens when you fall in love with somebody who you're supposed to treat like an animal? Act Two, Mucho Corazon. What happens when you fall for somebody that your country, your entire country, does not want you to live with? Act Three, a story of impossible love to end all stories of impossible love, or 1,001 one of them, anyway. Stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act Two: Mucho Corazon</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:22.44" data-timestamp="262.44">Act One, Meet the Ball and Chain. When Anne Staggs started to fall for an inmate named Charles in the Texas prison system, she was up against odds as daunting as they ever get for two people. It was against the rules, possibly dangerous. Certainly, it could put her job on the line.</p><p begin="00:04:36.91" data-timestamp="276.91">They were never alone. They could never say anything in front of other people. And he was, not to put too fine a point on this, a convicted murderer.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:45.53" data-timestamp="285.53">You know, in any relationship, there's some moment where somebody says to the other person, &quot;I'm having these feelings.&quot; When was that moment between the two of you, and where did it happen?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:04:54.78" data-timestamp="294.78">In the infirmary. I had been putting my medications on the computer, charting. And he came in. We'd been talking quite a bit that day.</p><p begin="00:05:08.55" data-timestamp="308.55">Anyway, he came in and said something to me. And I turned around and looked at him. And I said, &quot;I love you.&quot; And he looked me right square in the eye. And he says, &quot;No, you don't.&quot;</p><p begin="00:05:16.61" data-timestamp="316.61">And I told him, I said, &quot;Don't you ever, ever tell me I don't love you.&quot; I said, &quot;I didn't say I was in love with you. I said I loved you.&quot;</p><p begin="00:05:23.51" data-timestamp="323.51">And it took him a while to accept that, because he was of the opinion at that time that he didn't think he was worthy of being loved. And about two days later, he came back and told me that he loved me, too. I was sitting in the nurse's station with my head down, charting, when he walked in there.</p><p begin="00:05:45.18" data-timestamp="345.18">And I looked up and said, &quot;Hi.&quot; And he looked at me. He said, &quot;Hello.&quot; And I went back to charting. And he said, &quot;I love you.&quot; And I said, &quot;Thank you.&quot;</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:53.43" data-timestamp="353.43">Wow. How very businesslike.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:05:56.78" data-timestamp="356.78">Well, under the circumstances, with other people all around, it kind of had to be.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:07.61" data-timestamp="367.61">How much time was it between him saying that he loved you and you actually kissing?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:06:15.82" data-timestamp="375.82">About a month.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:18.07" data-timestamp="378.07">And if you're willing, I mean, I don't mean to pry too much if you don't want to talk about this. But what were the circumstances of you actually kissing the first time?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:06:29.69" data-timestamp="389.69">At 5 o'clock every day, we give the insulin to the diabetics.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:33.73" data-timestamp="393.73">How romantic.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:06:36.35" data-timestamp="396.35">No, that's not romantic. And someone had stuck their size 14 foot right in the middle of the sheet on the gurney. And I mean there was a big footprint right there. And I hollered at him and asked him to come change the sheet on the gurney. And while he was changing the sheet on the gurney is when I took the opportunity to kiss him. And I was the one that instigated it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:09.04" data-timestamp="429.04">Was he surprised?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:07:10.03" data-timestamp="430.03">Yes. He seemed very surprised.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:14.55" data-timestamp="434.55">So how'd it go?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:07:15.97" data-timestamp="435.97">Wonderful. Very, very, very sweet. I would love to be able to put my arms around him right now.</p><p begin="00:07:33.04" data-timestamp="453.04">It progressed from there. Other than the hugs and the kisses, there was never any other sexual activity, period. There just couldn't be. That's just absolutely the way it was. It just couldn't be.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:48.26" data-timestamp="468.26">It sounds like you were in a situation where there's no possibility of privacy at all.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:07:53.14" data-timestamp="473.14">If we got a minute to talk by ourselves, that was unusual.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:07.59" data-timestamp="487.59">When was the next turning point in your feelings? When did you understand that things had gone to another level?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:08:15.06" data-timestamp="495.06">It was about the 1st of February. We were standing in the exam room, talking about something. He was cleaning and I was doing something else. And this blond guard walked in, who had never been in the infirmary unless she had to be, come in and asked for a cup of coffee. He always kept a big pot of coffee going in the back.</p><p begin="00:08:39.38" data-timestamp="519.38">And when he left the room with her to get her a cup of coffee, I could have just easily pulled her head off and told God she died. And that's when I realized I was in way over my head, and there was no denying the fact that I was in love with him. It had gotten to the point that I knew that we would eventually be discovered, simply because I really had a problem staying away from him. And the security staff watches you like hawks. So it was inevitable.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:25.61" data-timestamp="565.61">Do you think it makes it more intense, the fact that your feelings were forbidden for each other?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:09:33.88" data-timestamp="573.88">Oh, definitely. You can talk to any woman or any inmate that has developed a relationship under the circumstances that ours was developed. And they will tell you beyond belief that the intensity of the relationship and the intensity of the feelings is far beyond anything that we've ever experienced before. I know several of the women that are married to inmates, and they'll tell you the same thing.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:07.75" data-timestamp="607.75">Now you've been married before too, yeah?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:10:09.71" data-timestamp="609.71">Yes. I was married for 26 years.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:13.44" data-timestamp="613.44">And this is more intense than--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:10:15.97" data-timestamp="615.97">Oh, yes. I have discovered that I never knew what being in love was.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:22.98" data-timestamp="622.98">Do you worry that your feelings are still idealized because you just haven't had the time to spend with each other alone?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:10:34.12" data-timestamp="634.12">To a point, yes. There's going to be a lot of adjustments to be done whenever we finally get to be together.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:54.49" data-timestamp="654.49">And so what happened next?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:10:57.99" data-timestamp="657.99">On February 23, a guard came in. And he and I were standing back by the refrigerator fussing. He was getting ready to go back to his cell. And it was a few minutes until I got off work. And we were talking and cutting up.</p><p begin="00:11:14.09" data-timestamp="674.09">And she reported that she had caught us kissing, which she did not. That don't mean I hadn't kissed him. At that point, she did not catch us kissing, OK?</p><p begin="00:11:27.85" data-timestamp="687.85">And a little while later, after he went to his cell, the lieutenant brought him back to the infirmary to do his PHD physical, which was a Pre-Hearing Detention physical. Which means he's in big trouble. And I asked him what they were bringing him down there for, and they said that he was under investigation.</p><p begin="00:11:52.75" data-timestamp="712.75">And I did his physical. And I kept telling him, I'm sorry. I knew whenever she came in and looked at us the way she did that she was going to report us. And I kept telling him I was very sorry that it was coming down, because I knew that it was really going to be bad on him.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:09.63" data-timestamp="729.63">Wait a second. Let me be sure I've got this right. So he's about to get punished for kissing you and being close to you. And the first part of the punishment is that he's sent to you to be physically examined?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:12:23.85" data-timestamp="743.85">Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:24.80" data-timestamp="744.8">Does this not strike you as being kind of an odd thing, that he's about to be punished essentially for the two of you touching, and the first moment of the punishment is he's sent to you alone for you to--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:12:36.60" data-timestamp="756.6">Oh, he wasn't alone. The lieutenant was with him and sneering the whole time.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:40.31" data-timestamp="760.31">Oh, OK. Understood.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:12:43.57" data-timestamp="763.57">I was allowed to leave the unit that night. Then I was called back onto the unit about 10 o'clock the next morning. And I spent a couple hours in interrogation with the internal affairs people.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:59.12" data-timestamp="779.12">What'd they ask and what'd you tell them?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:13:04.30" data-timestamp="784.3">There was a lot of questions. They ask about the sexual activity, which there was none. They ask if I had been bringing contraband in to him, which there was none. They wanted me to tell them every sordid detail. And I was not real cooperative in that area.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:20.80" data-timestamp="800.8">Do they even ask you about your feelings for him in that situation?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:13:25.24" data-timestamp="805.24">Yes, they did.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:25.97" data-timestamp="805.97">They do. How exactly do they ask? Do they actually ask the question, &quot;Do you love him?&quot;</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:13:31.63" data-timestamp="811.63">Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:33.57" data-timestamp="813.57">And did you admit to loving him?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:13:35.68" data-timestamp="815.68">Yes. Yes, and then they insisted that I write my resignation.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:43.96" data-timestamp="823.96">Did you get a chance to say goodbye to him?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:13:46.20" data-timestamp="826.2">No.</p><p begin="00:13:59.14" data-timestamp="839.14">They gave him a year on medium custody. And they put him in the fields to work.</p><p begin="00:14:07.07" data-timestamp="847.07">Now when they were talking to him and interrogating him, internal affairs had told him that after it was all over with, and after everything calmed down, that he would be able to put me on his visiting list and I would be able to see him. He put me on his visiting list in September. And my birthday's in October, so he wrote and told me that I could come see him the week after my birthday. When I went in to see him, they would not let me see him at all. One of the officers there recognized me and told me that I could not visit with him. They stopped him, gave him a major case. And he started his one year over again in medium custody. So he was actually on medium custody for 19 months.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:14:59.15" data-timestamp="899.15">So you didn't even see him for a moment?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:15:00.76" data-timestamp="900.76">No. No, they never let him out of the building to come to the visitation area.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:15:05.22" data-timestamp="905.22">What rule was he violating at that point? You were no longer a prison employee.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:15:09.43" data-timestamp="909.43">One of the officers lied and said that they had given him a direct order for him not to put me on his visiting list. They wrote him a major case on disobeying a direct order. And my husband had never gotten a case before, had never been in any problems, no disciplinary problems before. And it still hurts my pride.</p><p begin="00:15:41.85" data-timestamp="941.85">The next letter that I got from him, of course, he was really upset because they had stopped the visit. And then in the very next letter, he asked me to marry him. He said he had wanted to do that at visitation. But since they are not going to let us visit, that he wanted me to marry him right then.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:16:03.87" data-timestamp="963.87">And were you surprised?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:16:08.83" data-timestamp="968.83">Yes. The fact is when I was reading the letter, I went to crying. I was very, very happy at that point. And a girlfriend of mine who was already married to an inmate was there with me. And she kind of got upset, because she thought there was something else desperately wrong. Whenever I told her that he had asked me to marry him, she says, &quot;Well, are you going on?&quot; I said &quot;Well, of course.&quot;</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:16:38.82" data-timestamp="998.82">How does it work? Does he basically just sign something, and you sign something, and then you're married?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:16:45.33" data-timestamp="1005.33">No. He sent me what is called a proxy paper out, saying that he intentionally asked me to marry him, that he wants to marry me. And there's some other stuff on it. And then I have to take that and his identification papers and obtain the marriage license.</p><p begin="00:17:06.36" data-timestamp="1026.36">And you know that we got married right here on the radio station. And my deal about doing it that way is I wanted my husband present at our wedding. And that was the only way that that was going to happen.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:25.73" data-timestamp="1045.73">So then the marriage takes place on the <i>Prison</i> <i>Show</i> on KPFT in Houston. And the host of the show, Ray Hill, stands in as proxy for Charles, who's still in his cell somewhere.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>M. O. Johnson</h4><p begin="00:17:37.35" data-timestamp="1057.35">My name is [? M. O. Johnson. ?] I'm pastor at Rose of Sharon Baptist Church. And I am glad to be on this program to do this wedding. I told Sister Anne that this is the right thing to do.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:17:56.47" data-timestamp="1076.47">It was fantastic. At that point in my life, you could not have told me that this was not the most beautiful cathedral in the city of Houston.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>M. O. Johnson</h4><p begin="00:18:07.27" data-timestamp="1087.27">Well, now, let us start the ceremony. Brother Stagg, this is for you. Wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife, to live together after God's holy ordinance, in the holy state of matrimony? Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honor her, and keep her, in sickness and in health, for as long as ye both shall live?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ray Hill</h4><p begin="00:18:39.79" data-timestamp="1119.79">For Charles, by proxy, I do.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>M.

He wrote you and told you that he heard the wedding show.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:18:47.20" data-timestamp="1127.2">Oh, yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:18:47.96" data-timestamp="1127.96">What did he say about it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:18:49.14" data-timestamp="1129.14">He repeated his vows right along with Ray.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:18:54.19" data-timestamp="1134.19">That's what he did when he was listening?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anne Staggs</h4><p begin="00:18:56.26" data-timestamp="1136.26">Yes.

Stories of people kept apart who think that they should be together. We have arrived at act two of our program. Act Two, Mucho Corazon.</p><p begin="00:24:08.86" data-timestamp="1448.86">In any love story, there always has to be some thing, some moment, some device to bring the two people together. And this next story begins with a man in Amsterdam, Leon Perlee, and a woman in Cuba named Milades Sosa. And what brings them together from such different worlds is an instrument, a musical instrument. That's all it takes, my friend.</p><p begin="00:24:34.74" data-timestamp="1474.74">The instrument in this particular case is a street organ, an antique street organ, big and made of wood. It doesn't have a keyboard or anything. You crank a handle and it works like a player piano, blowing air through holes in these long cardboard sheets. Leon has a small workshop in Amsterdam where he restores these. It's how he makes a living.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leon Perlee</h4><p begin="00:25:01.75" data-timestamp="1501.75">It has to be punched with holes in a certain pattern. When a hole in the book passes over one of the keys, the key will jump up in the hole. And the note in the organ, which is connected with this particular key, will start to sound. And then the pipes will start to speak. OK, let's start the organ.</p><p begin="00:25:31.66" data-timestamp="1531.66">[MUSIC PLAYING - STREET ORGAN]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:41.52" data-timestamp="1541.52">In Europe today, these hand-cranked organs are ancient history. But as it turns out, a century ago, these European machines crossed the Atlantic. And these days, in Cuba, a street organ factory is still in operation, a factory caught in a bubble in time, still turning out these instruments. Naturally, Leon had to go see it for himself three years ago.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leon Perlee</h4><p begin="00:26:17.71" data-timestamp="1577.71">So I was standing at Guarda la Vaca beach, white sands, blue sea, blue sky, people in swimming suits and bikinis. Yeah, it's very nice. And there was a big open-air tent. And there was an organ with a battery of percussions next to it, five people playing conga, bongo, timbales. And people were so impressed by it because it was just like a real orchestra which was playing. And it was marvelous.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Milades Sosa</h4><p begin="00:27:01.33" data-timestamp="1621.33">Well, my uncle, the one who works in the organ factory, told me that there was a group from Holland that was going to be at the factory. They were interested in organs. And they were going to have a party for those persons. He invited me to go there, but I was a little afraid. I didn't dare to talk to any foreigner.</p><p begin="00:27:22.69" data-timestamp="1642.69">And then I think he said I could help translate. And he insisted. And I didn't want to be unpolite.

But I didn't do so until I thought time was right for it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Milades Sosa</h4><p begin="00:45:30.81" data-timestamp="2730.81">We were walking around the city. It was afternoon. We decided to sit down in Parque San Jose. We were drinking Bavaria, a Dutch beer.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leon Perlee</h4><p begin="00:45:42.90" data-timestamp="2742.9">And we were just talking. At a certain moment, I said to her, &quot;What would you think about the idea to be my wife?&quot; And she said--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Milades Sosa</h4><p begin="00:45:52.02" data-timestamp="2752.02">Of course. I want to marry you. And I asked him, &quot;Can you say it again? Can you ask again?&quot;</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leon Perlee</h4><p begin="00:45:59.05" data-timestamp="2759.05">And so I repeated my question. I said, &quot;Do you want to become my wife and live with me?&quot; After she got back her breath, she said yes and started crying. So I had to wait again for the rest of the answer. But I can tell that it was very encouraging what happened.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Milades Sosa</h4><p begin="00:46:20.83" data-timestamp="2780.83">And we kissed. I was living in a cloud. We were both, together, living in a cloud.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 1</h4><p begin="00:46:36.10" data-timestamp="2796.1">That is impossible. Holland is not an immigration country.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leon Perlee</h4><p begin="00:46:40.64" data-timestamp="2800.64">I invited her to come here in March last year.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 1</h4><p begin="00:46:44.06" data-timestamp="2804.06">That is impossible.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:46:44.89" data-timestamp="2804.89">70%--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 2</h4><p begin="00:46:45.55" data-timestamp="2805.55">If you don't have enough income--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leon Perlee</h4><p begin="00:46:55.71" data-timestamp="2815.71">The request was denied by the authorities. With the Cuban government, it's no problem. She has the permissions which she needs to leave the country. But here in Holland-- in fact, in Europe-- it's getting harder and harder every day to have permits for strangers who want to come in to the fortress of Europe.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 2</h4><p begin="00:47:23.69" data-timestamp="2843.69">My name is [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

And I am working at the Dutch Immigration Board. Well, in the Netherlands we have a restrictive admittance policy because we are just a small country. We don't have a lot of space and not enough jobs. And that's why we are carrying out a restrictive policy. So we just look at the rules, and whether they are in love is not really a criterion.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 2</h4><p begin="00:48:00.42" data-timestamp="2880.42">Anyway, you can invite a Cuban person to the Netherlands if you comply with the requirements of the Dutch authorities. It only costs you a lot of money.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leon Perlee</h4><p begin="00:48:19.46" data-timestamp="2899.46">The problem which I have to ask the authorities is that I can't show them on paper that I have a basic income. When you are in love, you don't think about politics. You think just like humans, without any borders, without authorities, because actually, every political system means a prison for people. And for Milades in Cuba, she had a lot of problems because she couldn't get any job. And, well, she has been feeling quite miserable.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Milades Sosa</h4><p begin="00:49:09.17" data-timestamp="2949.17">Here, there are rules. To work in certain places, you cannot have any kind of relation with foreigners. I would like to work at the airport, for example, guide in foreigners. And that's something I applied to do.</p><p begin="00:49:24.86" data-timestamp="2964.86">And I could do it. I have many classmates who have gone to the airport to work. And they are there. But if they find out I am with a foreigner, I cannot be there. It as if we become something dangerous.</p><p begin="00:49:56.12" data-timestamp="2996.12">This was a present from him. He brought it in December, when he came. It's a music box with the shape of an organ. It's a nice present. I keep it with love.

  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:51:54.90" data-timestamp="3114.9">Act Three, Who Deserves What. The story of <i>The</i> <i>Arabian</i> <i>Nights</i> is actually 350 or 400 stories, depending on how you count them. Many of the stories are stories of impossible love, including the very last story in the whole epic tale, the story of Jasmine and Almond. Mary Zimmerman is the Chicago director who adapted <i>The</i> <i>Arabian</i> <i>Nights</i> for the stage.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Zimmerman</h4><p begin="00:52:15.09" data-timestamp="3135.09">There are two lovers who meet in a dream, actually. The girl has a dream of someone. And at the same time, a prince in a faraway place-- he gives some milk to a dervish who asks him for some milk from a cow he's tending. And in gratitude for this, he describes this beautiful woman who's perfect for him, who happens to be the woman who had a dream of him.</p><p begin="00:52:40.54" data-timestamp="3160.54">So he goes to the other kingdom. He wanders around. He's sort of in disguise. He sort of looks like a shepherd, because he's actually out of his mind with grief, because he can't find her. He's afraid he won't find her.</p><p begin="00:52:50.33" data-timestamp="3170.33">She similarly has fallen ill. And all the doctors in the kingdom are coming in, trying to cure her. But nothing will help, and she won't say what the matter is.</p><p begin="00:52:58.21" data-timestamp="3178.21">And then one day, her maid comes to her and says, &quot;There's a shepherd outside at our gates, and he looks like--&quot; and he proceeds to describe him, which is exactly as how he appeared in her dream. And so she runs to her father, who she's never asked anything from before, and begs him to hire this particular shepherd. And he does. And so things come about, they go about.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:20.38" data-timestamp="3200.38">Now so far, it seems like we're heading on our way to a very happy story.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Zimmerman</h4><p begin="00:53:23.52" data-timestamp="3203.52">Yeah, but things get in the way. For one thing, he's disguised as a shepherd. And she's a princess. So there's a conflict already there.</p><p begin="00:53:30.26" data-timestamp="3210.26">She's supposed to stay behind the curtain of the harem, which she doesn't do. And so one day, she decides to take lunch to him. She pretends she's just taking lunch to all the shepherds, but she serves it on silver dishes.</p><p begin="00:53:41.80" data-timestamp="3221.8">And her uncle sees this, her calamitous uncle, who's so full of hatred of the world that all he wants to do is ruin everyone's happiness. And he always stops musicians from playing and stops people from being together, whatever else he can do, because he's so miserable himself. So he runs straight away to his brother, the father, and tells him about this.</p><p begin="00:53:59.53" data-timestamp="3239.53">And the girl gets into a world of trouble. And she's sent behind the curtain of the harem again. And so they're going to actually marry her off to the son of the calamitous uncle, actually. So I will read it.</p><p begin="00:54:14.50" data-timestamp="3254.5">&quot;The desolate Almond, who had been clothed against her will in splendid robes and the gold ornaments of marriage, sat on an elegant couch of gold brocade, a flower upon a bed of flowers, silent as a lily, motionless as an idol. She seemed as one dead among the living. But Jasmine, who had come with the other servants to the bridal of his mistress, gave her hope to drink from a single glance of his eyes. Surely the looks of lovers can say 20 things.</p><p begin="00:54:45.48" data-timestamp="3285.48">When night came, and the princess had been led to the marriage chamber, destiny turned a fortunate face to the lovers. Taking advantage of the little moment before her bridegroom should come to her, Almond glided from the chamber in her gold robes and fled to Jasmine. These two delightful children took hands and vanished, more lightly than the dew-wet breeze of morning.</p><p begin="00:55:08.77" data-timestamp="3308.77">Nothing has since been heard of them or their abiding place. There are few upon this earth worthy of happiness, worthy to take the road which leads to happiness, worthy to draw near the house of happiness.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:29.04" data-timestamp="3329.04">Mary, what do you make of the fact that there's this long, long plot that goes for pages and pages and pages, and then suddenly, they get to this moment. And rather than invent something to happen, the narrator just has them vanish, just suddenly, poof, you know?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Zimmerman</h4><p begin="00:55:44.67" data-timestamp="3344.67">I guess it maybe demonstrates a kind of faith in the possibility of miracle, or the possibility that there is, in fact, destiny in who you love. And that that place that we're always torn between-- is this a random event that I've met this person? Or this is actually the person where it's written somewhere or told somewhere, in this case, is the other part of myself? The ending of this story really manifests that longing that it is divine and that there is destiny.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:38.71" data-timestamp="3398.71">Mary Zimmerman teaches at Northwestern University. And let's close out this program with a moment from another story in <i>The</i> <i>Arabian</i> <i>Nights,</i> Aziz and Aziza, another story of impossible love. He stands her up on their wedding day. After that, in her love for him, she helps him scheme to get another woman. And then she dies for her love, dying with a poem.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Zimmerman</h4><p begin="00:56:58.43" data-timestamp="3418.43">She says things like, &quot;Your careless head upon my heart lay nesting and dreamed another woman while I wept. So dig my grave deep, and put these words above-- she fears not death, for she has known love.&quot;</p></div>  </div>
