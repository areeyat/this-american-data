  <h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.57" data-timestamp="0.57"> When Dave was turning his life around and trying different things and figuring out what to do next, one of the places he looked was to the <i>Howard</i> <i>Stern</i> <i>Show.</i> And I think that was a really good choice.</p><p begin="00:00:10.23" data-timestamp="10.23">I know everybody is not a fan of Howard Stern, but I am. And I think that one of the best things about the show is that it's always been a place where people talk with this kind of brutal and funny honesty about themselves. One of Howard's innovations is that he took the strain of crude, dark, confessional comedy that's always been a big part of stand-up, ever since Lenny Bruce-- Howard figured out a way to turn that into radio, daily radio.</p><p begin="00:00:35.16" data-timestamp="35.16">Anyway, to get back to this guy Dave, he loved that about the show. And in 2015, he was a few months sober, in his early 40s, working as a waiter at Katz's Deli in New York City. When he was younger, he'd worked in television, hosting an interview show for college kids but ruined that career with heroin addiction.</p><p begin="00:00:52.83" data-timestamp="52.83">Now sober in recovery, he needed a project. And he decided to a podcast about drugs with the feeling of the <i>Howard</i> <i>Stern</i> <i>Show.</i> Like, he remembered the years when comedian Artie Lange was on Howard Stern-- definitely my favorite period of Howard Stern.</p><p begin="00:01:06.97" data-timestamp="66.97">When Artie would come on every day. He would talk about his own drug problems. He would tell crazy stories. He would talk in this very real way about the mistakes he was making in his life at that time that he was not able to stop, and Dave wanted to shoot for that. He would co-host the show with his friend Chris who-- he had met Chris years before in rehab.</p><p begin="00:01:26.28" data-timestamp="86.28">They would spend hours in rehab smoking cigarettes and talking about the crazy things that they'd done on drugs. That's what they wanted the podcast to be. People'd come on, tell wild drug stories, and-- very important to Dave-- no recovery talk, which Dave found to be sanctimonious and annoying.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:01:42.66" data-timestamp="102.66"> This show is not necessarily about recovery.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:01:46.68" data-timestamp="106.68"> Mm-hmm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:01:47.58" data-timestamp="107.58"> It's about drugs.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:01:48.42" data-timestamp="108.42"> Maybe eventually it will be who knows.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:01:50.31" data-timestamp="110.31"> If this show is ever about recovery, you got to get somebody else in this spot. I'm out.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:55.59" data-timestamp="115.59"> OK, in case this isn't clear. In these recordings, Dave is the one with the deeper voice and the loud opinions, Chris is the other guy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:02:01.41" data-timestamp="121.41"> This show is about drug stories. It's not about recovery. It's not about doing the next right thing. It's about the last wrong thing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:02:07.92" data-timestamp="127.92"> But maybe with the evolution of your recovery, that's what the show will become.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:12.03" data-timestamp="132.03"> Notice how at the end there, Chris is not agreeing with Dave. Chris is 10 years younger than Dave, but started drugs and drinking at an earlier age-- he was just 11 or 12-- and has way more extreme stories about it, including a year in prison. He's also spent way more time in rehab.</p><p begin="00:02:28.19" data-timestamp="148.19">And at this point, he'd been sober for nearly two years versus four months for Dave. And all of that gave him a different feeling about recovery and sobriety. He was game to talk about it, but Dave was adamant. Sobriety isn't all that entertaining. And first and foremost, he wanted the podcast to be entertaining.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:02:46.47" data-timestamp="166.47"> If this show was about recovery, it's going to be lame.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:49.35" data-timestamp="169.35"> So they'd tell drug stories. It wasn't meant to be good for you. It was meant to be fun. They listed it in the comedy section of iTunes, not self-help. If you want self-help, Dave had said, go to a meeting.</p><p begin="00:03:04.93" data-timestamp="184.93">They were going to call the show <i>War</i> <i>Stories,</i> but there was already a podcast called <i>War</i> <i>Stories.</i> It was about actual war with tanks and guns and stuff, so they came up with <i>Dopey,</i> which really captures the spirit of the show perfectly. As Chris put it, two dopes talking about dope.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:03:22.15" data-timestamp="202.15"> Listen, I am so grateful to be sober. And I'm so grateful to be able to talk about drugs, you know, like in a way where I'm not feeling bad about it. It's not even euphoric recall. It's just funny.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:03:38.19" data-timestamp="218.19"> And I think that's why we got along, 'cause we felt safe doing that with each other. You know, sometimes you feel a little judged with people when you recount funny stuff that's happened to you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:03:47.55" data-timestamp="227.55"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:48.22" data-timestamp="228.22"> In <i>Dopey,</i> there's going to be no judgment of drug use, past or present. They recorded the first episode on a laptop, no microphone or anything, near a fish tank in Dave's apartment in Manhattan. Maybe you could hear the hum of the tank in that recording. But between this episode, Episode 1 and Episode 143 of <i>Dopey--</i> just 2 and 1/2 years later-- their lives are going to change drastically.</p><p begin="00:04:10.03" data-timestamp="250.03">By Episode 143, <i>Dopey</i> would sound completely different. In the episodes in between, they chronicle this story where so much happens to them and some others, things lots of drug users face. But because podcasts and radio are so intimate, it all gets documented in the most unfiltered way.</p><p begin="00:04:28.66" data-timestamp="268.66">Dave and Chris wanted their show to be just for fun, but it ended up being so much more. Today, we're going to have two stories like this. Stories about a kind of DIY radio-- very different kinds of DIY radio-- but in both stories, it's amateurs inventing how to talk about what it is that they're going through.</p><p begin="00:04:48.49" data-timestamp="288.49">And really, both stories are dispatches from two very different battlefields. I know that sounds a little grand, but really this story-- from the opioid epidemic-- and then the other story is from a small town in Syria, in the middle of the war that's going on there. And we hear about life during that war in this way that is much more personal and close up than we usually get. From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One: Two Dope Kings</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:20.29" data-timestamp="320.29"> Act One, Two Dope Kings. So OK, you remember the premise? Two guys-- Dave and Chris-- they have this podcast. It's called <i>Dopey.</i> Dana Chivvis from our staff, listened to dozens of hours of the podcast, spanning 2 and 1/2 years, and tells the story of what happened.</p><p begin="00:05:37.49" data-timestamp="337.49">Quick warning before we start, since this is the podcast internet version of our show, we have removed the bleeps that we use when we do the show on the radio. If you prefer a bleeped version of the show, it's at our website. Now here's Dana.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:05:49.75" data-timestamp="349.75"> We've been talking about this podcast for five minutes already. And the whole point of the podcast is to tell crazy drug stories, so let's get right to one. This is from the very first episode. Chris tells the story.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:06:01.12" data-timestamp="361.12"> So I relapsed. I don't even want to say I relapsed. I just started using again after a brief period of abstinence. And I took a lot of Xanax-- about 60 bars-- for those of you that know bars.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:06:12.58" data-timestamp="372.58"> At once?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:06:13.47" data-timestamp="373.47"> No, over a period of about three or four days.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:06:15.22" data-timestamp="375.22"> So you took 120 milligrams over four days?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:06:18.25" data-timestamp="378.25"> Yeah, and I blacked out for about a week. And during that blackout, I robbed a veterinarian. I went into the veterinary clinic. I told them my cat was having seizures and I needed phenobarbital ASAP. They told me something like, you know, we don't just hand out medications for the asking. Please fill out some paperwork and can we see your cat? Obviously, I had no cat with me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:06:39.82" data-timestamp="399.82"> Did you have a cat at home?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:06:41.20" data-timestamp="401.2"> I did have a cat at home, Smegal.</p><p begin="00:06:42.73" data-timestamp="402.73">[LAUGHING]</p><p begin="00:06:44.74" data-timestamp="404.74">So I fill out the paperwork. And while I was filling out the paperwork, I ended up putting it down and storming into the back, knocked over the nurse. And the veterinarian came into the medication storage room and tried to stop me.</p><p begin="00:06:57.43" data-timestamp="417.43">I got out. The police came. I struggled with the police and fought them, and got a bunch of assaults on the police officers. There was a helicopter on the scene. It was a big, big deal.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:07:06.21" data-timestamp="426.21"> And just so you know something about Chris-- he's burly. Chris is at least six feet. He's like one of these Massachusetts Protestant white guys. He's very big and broad. And I would be scared if Chris got upset.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:07:20.41" data-timestamp="440.41"> But I'm a gentle person.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:07:21.55" data-timestamp="441.55"> Very gentle, very gentle soul-- like a lamb.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:07:25.31" data-timestamp="445.31"> If Chris is the lamb in a drug addicts clothing, Dave is the border collie, constantly circling Chris, herding him between drug stories, nipping at his ankles. For his Boston accent--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:07:35.95" data-timestamp="455.95"> Oh you invite all your Facebook friends to like <i>Dopey.</i></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:07:39.64" data-timestamp="459.64"> No, I invite certain ones.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:07:41.50" data-timestamp="461.5"> Certain?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:07:42.26" data-timestamp="462.26"> Certain--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:07:43.15" data-timestamp="463.15"> Which certain ones do invite up to your room?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:07:46.10" data-timestamp="466.1"> Room--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:07:46.59" data-timestamp="466.59"> I invite certain friends up to my room.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:07:50.84" data-timestamp="470.84"> Or for Chris's vaping habit--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:07:52.87" data-timestamp="472.87"> What's the flavor?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:07:54.85" data-timestamp="474.85"> This flavor is the milk inspired by Momofuku.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:07:58.71" data-timestamp="478.71"> Ugh-- this fucking vaping-- it's the end of the world and it's--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:08:04.18" data-timestamp="484.18"> Chris, on the other hand, comes across as a sweet docile kind of dope who finds subtle ways to subvert Dave's alpha maleness. Like on episode 15, it's as easy as the word toodles.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:08:14.84" data-timestamp="494.84"> OK, toodles.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:08:15.96" data-timestamp="495.96"> No, no, no, we don't say toodles.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:08:17.95" data-timestamp="497.95"> Which Dave hates, so Chris starts saying it at the end of every show.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:08:21.61" data-timestamp="501.61"> All right, toodles.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:08:23.09" data-timestamp="503.09"> Please stop staying toodles.</p><p begin="00:08:24.27" data-timestamp="504.27">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:08:25.96" data-timestamp="505.96"> They do very little editing, except they do bleep out people's last names. They want the show to be anonymous, which is why I'm not using last names either, by the way. And they use nontraditional bleeps like this one.</p><p begin="00:08:36.28" data-timestamp="516.28">[LASER SOUND]</p><p begin="00:08:38.20" data-timestamp="518.2"><i>Dopey</i> is not the kind of show you bring home to meet your parents. Dave and Chris swear a lot, for one thing. And obviously they're talking about heavy drug use. But it's not just that-- they can be insensitive and insulting too.</p><p begin="00:08:50.44" data-timestamp="530.44">It is not politically correct by design. They use the kind of language you might forgive your grandfather for using, but which is harder to stomach coming from a 30 or 40 year old today. And then sometimes there's also language you wouldn't forgive your grandfather for using. I'm not going to play you that stuff.</p><p begin="00:09:07.21" data-timestamp="547.21">On the first few episodes of <i>Dopey,</i> they run through most of their favorite drug stories-- how Chris made wine from orange juice at rehab, how Dave once stayed up all night doing coke, heroin, and ecstasy before appearing on Howard Stern. How Chris shot crystal meth while at a brain injury clinic.</p><p begin="00:09:23.32" data-timestamp="563.32">They're not supposed to be engaging in recovery talk, but of course, the only reason <i>Dopey</i> can exist is because Dave and Chris are both in recovery. There'd be no <i>Dopey</i> without it, so recovery keeps slipping into the conversation. Even Dave does it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:09:37.03" data-timestamp="577.03"> We're actually in a hurry, because I have to go qualify at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting at 8:00.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:09:42.77" data-timestamp="582.77"> Yeah, it's a live episode of <i>Dopey</i> basically.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:09:45.15" data-timestamp="585.15"> Basically, but more based on the recovery end of things. I'm a little bit nervous about it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:09:49.40" data-timestamp="589.4"> Are you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:09:49.89" data-timestamp="589.89"> Yeah, just let it rip. Don't even think about it, that's the best way to do it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:09:53.74" data-timestamp="593.74"> Chris actually has a scholarly knowledge of 12 step philosophy. And now and then, he quotes by memory from the big book, which is sort of the Bible of Alcoholics Anonymous.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:10:02.50" data-timestamp="602.5"> And then they added the appendix to the book where they quote William James, who says that you have a spiritual experience of the educational variety. That's what you're talking about. And it's actually--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:10:13.63" data-timestamp="613.63"> In the beginning-- for the first 20 episodes or so-- they get like 500 downloads an episode-- so barely an audience, but they start hearing from people right away. They get their first fan email from some guy named Troy three weeks after they upload the first episode. They can't believe anyone is listening to them. They call their newfound audience The Dopey Nation.</p><p begin="00:10:33.19" data-timestamp="633.19">Other people start emailing, leaving reviews on iTunes. Some listeners leave voicemails with their own war stories. Their downloads grow. By October, they average about 1,000 downloads an episode.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:10:44.29" data-timestamp="644.29"> So whoever The Dopey Nation is now, stay strong Dopey Nation.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:10:50.65" data-timestamp="650.65"> There's a Reddit thread about <i>Dopey.</i> A few people even get <i>Dopey</i> tattoos with the show's logo and the word Toodles underneath it. One guy takes Dave and Chris out to a steak dinner. He tells them he didn't get sober until he started listening to their show.</p><p begin="00:11:04.27" data-timestamp="664.27">Dave and Chris try to write back to every email they get. They respond to comments on Facebook and Twitter. People aren't turned off by the recovery talk. They like listening to sober guys having fun, enjoying life in recovery. It gives them hope. Chris says the listeners come for the debauchery and stay for the recovery. He calls his marketing strategy rope a dope.</p><p begin="00:11:31.71" data-timestamp="691.71">Dave and Chris know they have a finite number of drug stories between the two of them, so they develop a roster of recurring guests, friends of theirs who are also sober-- near celebrities like Rob Reiner's son, Nick, Dave's dad Alan, and then there's a guy named Todd, one of Dave's best friends from college.</p><p begin="00:11:48.79" data-timestamp="708.79">They got addicted to heroin together in their 20s. Dave always said if Todd got sober, he could be the third host of <i>Dopey,</i> and Todd really wants to be on <i>Dopey,</i> but Todd is never sober.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Todd</h4><p begin="00:11:59.77" data-timestamp="719.77"> All right, well if you want a good story, you know who to call here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:12:03.12" data-timestamp="723.12"> Yeah, if you give me six months sobriety time and you're on the show.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Todd</h4><p begin="00:12:06.32" data-timestamp="726.32"> What?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:12:07.62" data-timestamp="727.62"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Todd</h4><p begin="00:12:08.31" data-timestamp="728.31"> I'm still full of stories.

That's what worked for them, but the science shows that opioid addiction is best treated with medications like suboxone and methadone, which are associated with a 68% decrease in death.</p><p begin="00:14:08.98" data-timestamp="848.98">For a while on <i>Dopey,</i> Dave was pretty clear that he thought medications were dangerous, that you should learn to live without any substances. Chris was more middle of the road. Dave's opinions have changed by now. He feels like whatever works best for you is what you should do.</p><p begin="00:14:24.10" data-timestamp="864.1">Less than a year into making <i>Dopey,</i> Dave moved out of the apartment with the fish tank and in with his partner Linda and their six-year-old daughter. Chris eventually moved to Boston and started working towards a doctoral degree in psychology.</p><p begin="00:14:35.98" data-timestamp="875.98">He was dating a med student named Annie. They lived together, had a dog. He was also working part-time for his sister's company-- which helps people who are struggling with addiction and other issues find treatment-- and he was working every other weekend at a sober living house.</p><p begin="00:14:50.77" data-timestamp="890.77">By episode 96 of <i>Dopey,</i> they're getting about 3,000 listeners a show. They decide to relabel the show. They move it from the comedy section on iTunes to the self-help section, mainly because they thought they could compete better against other self-help podcasts, rather than comedy podcasts, but also because by now they've admitted to themselves they are, in fact, a self-help show.</p><p begin="00:15:12.87" data-timestamp="912.87">But anyway, back to Todd. On <i>Dopey,</i> Todd is the foil to the sober good life, to their successes. Where he lacks control, Dave and Chris now exercise restraint. Where he is depressed, they are content. Where he can't hold down a job, they're raising children, getting advanced degrees, making a podcast every week.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:15:31.96" data-timestamp="931.96"> Do something good for yourself tomorrow.

They weren't close friends, but even still, Dave thinks Chris is a little cold about his death. And Dave knows this is unfair, but he feels a little resentful towards Chris.

Dave was pissed. He went in and fixed it, but inadvertently inserted 10 minutes of silence into the middle of the episode, which made Chris mad. So that Monday they're fighting over text message all day.</p><p begin="00:25:37.45" data-timestamp="1537.45">Dave couldn't make sense of what was going on with Chris. He told Chris it was fine if he didn't want to do <i>Dopey</i> anymore. But Chris said no, that wasn't it at all. He loved making <i>Dopey.</i> Dave believed him.</p><p begin="00:25:50.36" data-timestamp="1550.36">But meanwhile, Chris was also fighting with Annie.

So three days after Chris's death, he recorded that episode of <i>Dopey.</i> And he calls Annie.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Annie</h4><p begin="00:27:08.37" data-timestamp="1628.37"> Hello?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:27:09.25" data-timestamp="1629.25"> Hey, you're on--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Annie</h4><p begin="00:27:11.23" data-timestamp="1631.23"> Hey, how are you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:27:11.92" data-timestamp="1631.92"> You're on the show.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Annie</h4><p begin="00:27:13.54" data-timestamp="1633.54"> Oh, ha-ha-- hello, everybody.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:27:17.45" data-timestamp="1637.45"> How are you feeling?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Annie</h4><p begin="00:27:21.27" data-timestamp="1641.27"> Ah, pretty shitty.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:27:23.79" data-timestamp="1643.79"> They start to piece together the mystery of Chris's death. Dave had completely misread his behavior. In retrospect, he was probably high on the last episode of <i>Dopey.</i> He was probably high when he made that weird phone call to his sponsor. He was probably even high on the Artie Lange episode.</p><p begin="00:27:41.29" data-timestamp="1661.29">Dave had been operating off the wrong story-- that Chris wasn't interested in <i>Dopey</i> anymore, but Annie hadn't. She had noticed the strange ways Chris had been acting. He kept taking the dog for walks, for instance, when the dog didn't need to go out.</p><p begin="00:27:55.91" data-timestamp="1675.91">He was staying up all night and sleeping during the day. She got suspicious he was using again, so she and Chris's sister arranged for a surprise drug test. On Monday, a guy showed up at their apartment and did a saliva test.</p><p begin="00:28:09.10" data-timestamp="1689.1">That night, Annie told him she was going to stay with her parents. Chris left before her mom arrived to pick her up. Now she realized it was because he couldn't wait any longer to get high. Annie slept at her parents' house and went to work the next morning. But soon after, she went home to check on Chris.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Annie</h4><p begin="00:28:25.73" data-timestamp="1705.73"> And I don't know if you want me to elaborate on how it was walking into the apartment.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:28:31.91" data-timestamp="1711.91"> Yeah, you might as well.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Annie</h4><p begin="00:28:32.28" data-timestamp="1712.28"> Or would you rather I not.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:28:32.90" data-timestamp="1712.9"> No, you might as well.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Annie</h4><p begin="00:28:35.51" data-timestamp="1715.51"> I walked in. The first thing I see is his shoes, so I figure, OK, he's here. And the vape is there, the keys are there, so I look at the couch. He's not on the couch. And I look at the bed, and he's not there.</p><p begin="00:28:46.39" data-timestamp="1726.39">And then I [INAUDIBLE] bathroom, I go into the bathroom. He's not there. And that's when I start panicking, and-- and as I walk into the bedroom, on the side of the bed, I found him dead.</p><p begin="00:29:00.01" data-timestamp="1740.01">I knew right away he was dead. Everything after that is somewhat foggy. I knew we had Narcan at home, because he always kept Narcan everywhere.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:29:10.12" data-timestamp="1750.12"> Narcan is a medication that can reverse an opioid overdose. You spray it up a person's nose.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Annie</h4><p begin="00:29:15.37" data-timestamp="1755.37"> And I got the Narcan, but I knew it was too late. I just had to do it, because it was like the only thing I could do it at the moment.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:29:25.07" data-timestamp="1765.07"> Chris had cocaine, Xanax, alcohol, and fentanyl in his system. He was 33 years old. Soon after, a package arrived for him at their apartment. It was filled with drugs-- Percocet, cocaine, crack cocaine, heroin.</p><p begin="00:29:41.30" data-timestamp="1781.3">Annie scoured the apartment and Chris's car. She found a bunch of drug paraphernalia-- needles, some of which were used, and clean pee he'd ordered online. Also, she found a small medicated patch that wasn't in any packaging.</p><p begin="00:29:55.01" data-timestamp="1795.01">She sent a picture of it to Dave. They couldn't be sure, but Dave thought it was probably fentanyl. Annie has a theory about Chris's relapse.</p><p begin="00:30:05.27" data-timestamp="1805.27">He had recently injured himself doing a high karate kick to try to impress her. Something in his leg popped, he was in terrible pain.</p><p begin="00:30:13.92" data-timestamp="1813.92">The doctor he saw wasn't his regular doctor and she thinks Chris got painkillers, fooled himself into thinking he could just take them for the pain and stop there. If Annie's theory is right, then Chris started using again two weeks after Todd's death and was dead three weeks later.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:30:28.91" data-timestamp="1828.91"> I mean, when the news came, I got angry about it. And then the next morning I woke up and-- you know, I felt the day between the last time I had spoken to him. You know what I mean?</p><p begin="00:30:48.25" data-timestamp="1848.25">I felt the distance, and I was like, it just felt like it was becoming real. And then this morning I woke up, and I could hear his voice in my head like we were doing the show. I could hear his voice.</p><p begin="00:31:03.92" data-timestamp="1863.92">And then I kind of woke up and it was another day since I had spoken to him. And it just-- it's like liquid becoming solid. You know what I mean? And it's like, you move away from this liquid feeling to this cold solid truth that he is never going to come back and it's over.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:31:27.53" data-timestamp="1887.53"> Dave hangs up with Annie. And now he's got to end this episode of <i>Dopey</i> without Chris for the first time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:31:32.75" data-timestamp="1892.75"> We'll just end it the way we always end it. And we'll say, stay strong Dopey Nation. And I said I would never say this, but Chris is dead, so I'll say toodles for Chris. And we love you. And everybody out there, please try to take care of yourself. All right.</p><p begin="00:31:57.46" data-timestamp="1917.46"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:32:04.37" data-timestamp="1924.37"> Dave still makes <i>Dopey--</i> by himself now. He's pulling in bigger guests like the comedian Marc Maron and the rapper Killer Mike. He gets about 6,000 downloads an episode now, but it's not the same show.</p><p begin="00:32:17.29" data-timestamp="1937.29"><i>Dopey,</i> as the nation knew it, is gone along with Chris. It's not a buddy comedy anymore. It's more of a straight interview show. There are fewer war stories, and when there are, the tone is different. Dave is different.</p><p begin="00:32:31.63" data-timestamp="1951.63">There's this one moment in Episode 142, the last episode Dave and Chris did together, that I keep thinking about. Chris had just played a voicemail from a listener named Mike, who tells a story about hiding his pee in the closet of his bedroom. It's not important why. And afterwards, they get into a conversation about whether it's OK to laugh at drug stories.</p><p begin="00:32:50.94" data-timestamp="1970.94">In the first episodes of <i>Dopey,</i> Dave was a solid yes on that-- that was the whole point of the show-- but now they've flipped sides. Chris says yes, it's fine to laugh. And Dave says this--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:33:02.07" data-timestamp="1982.07"> I think it's funny, but the fucked up thing-- and it might be the end of <i>Dopey,</i> right? Check this out. Like, I just feel like this guy-- he's like everyone's laughing about everything they're doing. And then they can just drop dead.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:33:20.69" data-timestamp="2000.69"> But what's the flipside? Morbid reality the whole time until you die?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:33:26.42" data-timestamp="2006.42"> No, dude. I think it's funny. I think the urine is funny. I think that shit is hysterical. But it's like laughing on the train tracks and not seeing the fucking train coming. I don't think morbid reality is better. No, of course not. I'm just saying it's sad, you know?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:33:40.14" data-timestamp="2020.14"> We laugh on the train tracks, but we have the right to laugh on the train tracks. It'd be much different if someone had never struggled. And the truth is that when we were struggling, the person who would tell a story that was terrifying and laugh at it, might have a better chance at reaching us and getting us to stop than the person who's morbid reality.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:33:59.79" data-timestamp="2039.79"> I just feel responsible. I think it's obviously because of Todd's death that when we laugh at stuff, I just want to throw it out there that at any second, Mike could be dead. Because Mike's still using. And there's fentanyl everywhere. And it's killing everybody. That's what I'm saying. How's that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:34:18.64" data-timestamp="2058.64"> Yes, no, of course. Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:34:21.83" data-timestamp="2061.83"> Dave told me, he always thought <i>Dopey</i> was good for him and Chris, for their sobriety. He thought their creation would protect them, but it didn't. Chris is gone. <i>Dopey,</i> it turns out, was its own war story, playing out week by week.</p><p begin="00:34:38.55" data-timestamp="2078.55">So now on the show, Dave's mission has changed. The drug stories aren't just in service of a laugh now, they're in service of an urgent message. You could die. Todd died. Chris died. You could die.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:34:56.78" data-timestamp="2096.78"> Dana Chivvis is one of the producers of our show.

  <h3>Act Two: Good Morning, Kafranbel</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:35:20.29" data-timestamp="2120.29"> It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's show-- Wartime Radio. People in battlefields of one kind or another, using very DIY grassroots level radio or podcasting to try to make sense of what is happening around them. We've arrived at Act Two of our program. Act Two.</p><p begin="00:35:40.82" data-timestamp="2140.82">Good Morning, Kafrenbel. So back in my 20s, I was a volunteer reporter at a community radio station in Washington, DC-- WPFW, a great station, that really did reflect the community. DC was 2/3 African-American back then and also had immigrants from all over the world.</p><p begin="00:35:59.24" data-timestamp="2159.24">And the most popular show on the station, I remember, was the Bama hour. It was a guy named Jerry Washington who would play songs and talk a lot about his niece. There were Caribbean and Central American shows. There was a show made by Iranians who missed the former Shah of Iran. And then another show with Iranians who hated the former Shah of Iran.</p><p begin="00:36:18.41" data-timestamp="2178.41">There was a call-in poetry show. Listeners would call in and read their own poems and it was daily. This was a daily call-in poetry show, that in my memory anyway, never seemed to have any kind of trouble getting callers. That's community radio.</p><p begin="00:36:35.06" data-timestamp="2195.06">Well, this next story is about somebody setting up a station like that-- a community station-- only they're doing it in a war zone, in Syria, in a small town called Kafrenbel. That's Kafrenbel, it's spelled with a K-- in the Northwest part of the country, not far from the Turkish border, rural town, surrounded by olive trees and fig trees, 30,000 people live there.</p><p begin="00:36:56.11" data-timestamp="2216.11">And for almost eight years now, Kafrenbel's been in a kind of no-man's-land where different factions have fought. And now militant Islamists are in charge. Reporter Dana Ballout heard about the station years before she ever listened to it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Ballout</h4><p begin="00:37:08.93" data-timestamp="2228.93"> I crossed paths with the founder of the station back when I was covering the war in Syria for the <i>Wall</i> <i>Street</i> <i>Journal.</i> His name is Raed. Raed Fares. He lives in Kafrenbel.</p><p begin="00:37:19.58" data-timestamp="2239.58">We never met in person. I was based across the border in Lebanon, because American press was mostly not allowed in Syria. But when the regime struck a town near Kafrenbel or ISIS was advancing and I needed to know the details from the ground, me and my colleagues would pull out our giant spreadsheet of contacts and go through them. Raed's was one of those names. I'd Skype him to confirm a death count or verify a location, then move on.</p><p begin="00:37:44.66" data-timestamp="2264.66">Raed was an activist. Before the radio station, he was sort of famous for these banners, these homemade signs written in big block letters on white sheets. He would bring them to protests, post pictures of them on Facebook and Twitter. I always saw them in my feeds. They were witty, like this one from Thanksgiving, a holiday Syria does not celebrate.</p><p begin="00:38:05.32" data-timestamp="2285.32">Black Friday special offer-- whoever, wherever you are, bring your enemy and come to fight in Syria for free. Limited time offer.</p><p begin="00:38:15.46" data-timestamp="2295.46">One of the most viral of these was after Caitlyn Jenner announced her new name Caitlyn, spelled with a C and not a K like the other women's names in her family. Raed gave her this shout-out. Caitlyn, he writes spelling it with a C, we would write Kafrenbel with a C, if it meant, like you, we could be free.</p><p begin="00:38:36.58" data-timestamp="2316.58">I knew Raed had his own radio station, Radio Fresh, though I never tuned in back then. But around Thanksgiving last year, I heard Raed had been killed. It hit me harder than I expected.</p><p begin="00:38:49.08" data-timestamp="2329.08">Saddened by the news, I listened for the first time. You can stream Radio Fresh on SoundCloud. There's hours and hours of programming. Listening through was like reliving the war from the inside. Seeing it in a totally different way from deep in the small town.</p><p begin="00:39:04.35" data-timestamp="2344.35">It was incredibly alive, hyper-local, sometimes utterly ordinary, people complaining about their neighbors. But other times, so radical I couldn't believe they got away with it. Here's an example of that. One of the first things I heard-- this satire program called [ARABIC] backstage with the president, where an actor impersonating president Bashar al Assad has made up conversations with an officer in his army.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:39:28.90" data-timestamp="2368.9"> [SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Ballout</h4><p begin="00:39:39.41" data-timestamp="2379.41"> That's the actor making fun of the president's lisp, which is very pronounced. He's pretty spot-on.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:39:44.77" data-timestamp="2384.77"> [SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Ballout</h4><p begin="00:39:50.12" data-timestamp="2390.12"> I was shocked when I first heard this impression. My knee jerk reaction was oh my god, how did you not go to jail for this? Because in the past, that's what would have happened.</p><p begin="00:39:59.76" data-timestamp="2399.76">Before listening to Radio Fresh, I had literally heard of two other places in the whole Arab world where anyone had tried to do political satire-- one was Lebanon, where I'm from, and the other Egypt, where for a while til the government ran him out of the country, they had their own version of Jon Stewart. And now there were these guys out of a small town in northern Syria. It completely blew my mind.</p><p begin="00:40:25.80" data-timestamp="2425.8"></p><p begin="00:40:27.66" data-timestamp="2427.66">I talked to a bunch of Raed's friends in Kafrenbel. They told me he was always a rebel. Before the uprising against the Syrian regime, he would curse the president in a way no one else dared. He mocked religious figures too.</p><p begin="00:40:39.33" data-timestamp="2439.33">His cousin told me this always made people super nervous. Everyone in town knew him as the guy who got kicked out of med school. Raed was a burly guy in his mid 40s, clean shaven, warm eyes, mischievous face. He was sharp, taught himself English, ran a thriving small business.</p><p begin="00:40:56.16" data-timestamp="2456.16">One of his best friends, Hadi Abdullah, told me how Raed started the radio station.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hadi Abdullah</h4><p begin="00:41:00.85" data-timestamp="2460.85"> [SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:41:03.24" data-timestamp="2463.24"> In our mosques, they have loudspeakers.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Ballout</h4><p begin="00:41:05.52" data-timestamp="2465.52"> These are the speakers for the call to prayer five times a day. At one point, early in the war, the Syrian military showed up in Kafrenbel and started shooting protesters. Raed wanted to get those soldiers to defect.</p><p begin="00:41:17.71" data-timestamp="2477.71">So he loaded up a bunch of recordings on a USB stick and had some friends at the mosque blast them over those speakers. Anti- regime slogans like--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hadi Abdullah</h4><p begin="00:41:26.09" data-timestamp="2486.09"> [SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:41:28.83" data-timestamp="2488.83"> The regime is tricking you. The regime is using you. Regime is killing your family. There are no terrorists here, everybody is civilian here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hadi Abdullah</h4><p begin="00:41:36.45" data-timestamp="2496.45"> [SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:41:39.10" data-timestamp="2499.1"> And the idea started from here. And I was like, why am I limiting myself to the mosque only. Why don't I start a radio station, where I could to just talk to people?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Ballout</h4><p begin="00:41:49.32" data-timestamp="2509.32"> So shortly after, when Raed found himself meeting with international groups, including the US State Department, he pitched them his idea for a radio station. There are always opportunities in war, and this one would be an unusual chance to push back on the rules, make fun of people they could have never made fun of before, an opportunity to blast out ideas like free speech and democracy to whoever tuned in to 90.0 FM.</p><p begin="00:42:15.40" data-timestamp="2535.4"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:42:15.48" data-timestamp="2535.48"> [SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Ballout</h4><p begin="00:42:23.58" data-timestamp="2543.58"> This is a clip from the station's first few weeks on air, August 2013. Radio Fresh was based out of an old government building in Kafrenbel. The studio was done up with shiny purple curtains for soundproofing. There was an ashtray on the table and lots of smoking while they were on the mic.</p><p begin="00:42:39.66" data-timestamp="2559.66">The host, who's talking about how to form neighborhood councils, has a thick local accent. One of my favorite things about Radio Fresh-- it sounds rural, slangy, homegrown.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:42:50.17" data-timestamp="2570.17"> [SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Ballout</h4><p begin="00:42:55.16" data-timestamp="2575.16"> While I was charmed by the station from the very first clip I heard, the people it was actually made for-- the citizens of Kafrenbel-- many of them were against it in the beginning. Here's Raed himself, on the second anniversary of Radio Fresh, one of the rare times he actually went on air.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Raed Fares</h4><p begin="00:43:11.46" data-timestamp="2591.46"> [SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Ballout</h4><p begin="00:43:25.53" data-timestamp="2605.53"> He's saying, in the beginning, there was a lot of talk about how the money for the radio would have been better spent on aid for families in need. People were hungry. They didn't have clean water or electricity.</p><p begin="00:43:36.06" data-timestamp="2616.06">It seemed extravagant and frivolous to spend money on a radio show, but pretty early on, the station came up with a program that became indispensable throughout the village. It was called The Observatory. Radio Fresh put 24/7 watchmen in tall buildings to keep an eye out for air strikes.</p><p begin="00:43:53.01" data-timestamp="2633.01">As soon as they saw one, they radioed into the station, which would interrupt programming on, say, the nutritional benefits of lettuce--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:43:59.66" data-timestamp="2639.66"> [SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:44:04.69" data-timestamp="2644.69">[SIREN]</p><p begin="00:44:06.03" data-timestamp="2646.03"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Ballout</h4><p begin="00:44:07.83" data-timestamp="2647.83"> --with an air raid siren.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:44:13.25" data-timestamp="2653.25"> [SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Ballout</h4><p begin="00:44:17.06" data-timestamp="2657.06"> They're saying, planes are circling over Kafrenbel.

Before the observatory, people used to jerry-rig their own version of this alert system-- buying a walkie talkie and eavesdropping on the regime's frequencies.</p><p begin="00:44:50.73" data-timestamp="2690.73">It was expensive-- over $100. And parents hated how much the regime thugs would swear and cuss on the frequency. They didn't like that the kids overheard. The Observatory was a clean version for the cost of a basic radio-- $5.</p><p begin="00:45:07.04" data-timestamp="2707.04">The air raid warnings-- they were just one of a slew of super practical, you live in a war zone and here's how to survive of programs. There was a medical show that teaches people how to administer first aid. That show has episodes on chemical burns, meningitis in kids, how to treat head injuries--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:45:23.46" data-timestamp="2723.46"> [SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Ballout</h4><p begin="00:45:28.20" data-timestamp="2728.2"> Here the host is saying when you think your skull is broken or when you see blood or a clear fluid coming from your ears or nose, get medical help immediately.

So they put up a bunch of little black boxes with a Radio Fresh sticker on them, all around town. People would drop in slips of paper with their answers to quiz shows, their comments and complaints. The host would choose one complaint each week to talk about.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:46:43.94" data-timestamp="2803.94"> [SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:46:45.76" data-timestamp="2805.76"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Ballout</h4><p begin="00:46:48.66" data-timestamp="2808.66"> Often, it's very specific stuff. At one point early on, a faction set up shop inside a school building, using it as a police station. Parents were worried about sending their kids to school in a building shared with criminals and thieves. Plus, the police station made the school an easy target for the regime.</p><p begin="00:47:05.91" data-timestamp="2825.91">Parents told the rebels their concerns, but nothing happened. So they turned to Radio Fresh.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:47:10.94" data-timestamp="2830.94"> [SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:47:12.43" data-timestamp="2832.43"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Ballout</h4><p begin="00:47:24.81" data-timestamp="2844.81"> Today, we have a complaint that there is a police station in the same building as a school, and that, the broadcaster says, defies logic. Again, here's Raed's friend, Hadi.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hadi Abdullah</h4><p begin="00:47:35.55" data-timestamp="2855.55"> [SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:47:37.05" data-timestamp="2857.05"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:47:40.21" data-timestamp="2860.21"> Some when the people inside the police station heard the episode on the radio, they came right away to us, and they told us, "we're willing to leave the school. Please, tell the families we're going to leave the place. We don't want any trouble against us." And they did. They emptied the police station from all the militants that were there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Ballout</h4><p begin="00:47:58.20" data-timestamp="2878.2"> People complained about the price and quality of their bread. Someone brought up their neighbor using a hole in the front yard as a bathroom, while his actual bathroom was broken. The neighbor heard the episode and fixed his toilet. When I first heard the <i>Complaints</i> <i>Show,</i> it felt pretty familiar. We had a similar program in Lebanon, although not quite as small towny as the neighbor's toilet.</p><p begin="00:48:19.18" data-timestamp="2899.18">But listening hour after hour, what I realized was that this <i>Complaints</i> <i>Show</i> was doing something besides solving practical local problems. It was also spreading a revolutionary idea, that you could voice your concerns, and hold people accountable, and get results. The guys at the station confirmed this was Raed's original mission for the show. This, in a place where the rules were so recently non-negotiable and you just had to keep your head down and deal with it. The Complaints Show was just one of the many programs, debates, kids shows, series on Islam doing this kind of work.</p><p begin="00:49:03.13" data-timestamp="2943.13">One problem people had with the station from the beginning was that it was funded by the Americans, which, in the middle of a war where the US was not being particularly helpful, was not a good look.</p><p begin="00:49:14.23" data-timestamp="2954.23">It's true. Almost all the money for the station has come from the US State Department. It's around $40,000 a month these days, which covers the salaries of 53 people. It's a pretty big operation. When listeners accuse the station of being a mouthpiece for the Americans, Raed was happy to address it head on. This is him on the air.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Raed Fares</h4><p begin="00:49:34.21" data-timestamp="2974.21"> [SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:49:35.59" data-timestamp="2975.59"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Ballout</h4><p begin="00:49:43.75" data-timestamp="2983.75"> He says the response is very simple. Have you heard anything on Radio Fresh that sounds like we're supporting the Americans? We're always trying to prod them on the radio, with our banners. We have opinions about them, and we don't hide them. Raed's vision of democracy meant everyone in Kafrenbel had an equal say in what was happening, including women.</p><p begin="00:50:03.76" data-timestamp="3003.76">He wanted their voices on the radio too. Although that was such a daring idea for Kafrenbel, even his friend Hadi wondered whether it was possible.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hadi Abdullah</h4><p begin="00:50:11.47" data-timestamp="3011.47"> [SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:50:12.78" data-timestamp="3012.78"> And I was like, how? He was like, "Easy. You find women, we hire them, we train them."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Ballout</h4><p begin="00:50:18.82" data-timestamp="3018.82"> This was bold, because almost no women in the village worked outside the home. They took care of the kids and the homes. That was it. And it was bold because of who was running Kafrenbel at the time. Raed was always offending the local leaders, including just about everyone who was in charge of Kafrenbel over the last eight years.</p><p begin="00:50:36.74" data-timestamp="3036.74">First, the Free Syrian Army was offended by a banner, so they came to the radio station and kidnapped two guys. Next, ISIS attacked the station in 2013. A couple weeks later, they shot Raed multiple times, almost killing him. But when Raed was deciding to put women on the air in 2015, two years after Radio Fresh had started, Kafrenbel was run by a new extremist Islamist group, Nusra, al-Qaeda's branch in Syria. Raed knew they wouldn't like this, but he went for it anyway.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hiba Abboud</h4><p begin="00:51:07.42" data-timestamp="3067.42"> [SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:51:08.88" data-timestamp="3068.88"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Ballout</h4><p begin="00:51:17.05" data-timestamp="3077.05"> That's Hiba Abboud introducing the afternoon newscast.

She'd been listening to the radio and was curious what it was like to make it. So she, along with 20 other women, went to the first training. They did icebreakers, spent three days on voice technique.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hiba Abboud</h4><p begin="00:51:56.77" data-timestamp="3116.77"> [SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:52:01.87" data-timestamp="3121.87"> I don't know if you know this one, but when you put your pen in your mouth, this is a way to open up your voice.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Ballout</h4><p begin="00:52:08.08" data-timestamp="3128.08"> I did not know this one.

By the time Raed put Hiba and the other women on the air in 2015, the Islamists in charge of Kafrenbel, Nusra, already hated Radio Fresh.</p><p begin="00:52:35.17" data-timestamp="3155.17">The station poked fun at them in all sorts of ways. For being illiterate, hypocritical. One satire depicted their religious police rushing people to the mosque without actually understanding the rules of prayer. Nusra assigned people to listen to Radio Fresh in shifts. They issued regular warnings and threats to the station whenever they heard something they didn't like.</p><p begin="00:52:55.42" data-timestamp="3175.42">Now Radio Fresh got a lot of warnings for having women on air. Nusra considered their voices shameful, a form of nakedness. Finally, in January 2016, Nusra had had enough. They burst in one morning to shut the station down, broke down the door, faces covered, carrying machine guns. They took everything-- laptops, the transmitter, Hadi's hookah, flash drives. Hiba and the other women watched the Nusra guys ransack the main station from another building, the women's office just up the hill.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hiba Abboud</h4><p begin="00:53:27.03" data-timestamp="3207.03"> [SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:53:28.49" data-timestamp="3208.49"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:53:30.29" data-timestamp="3210.29"> And we looked out the window when we heard a lot of noise.

They left two armed men at the station to keep anyone from coming in. Every day, Hiba would finish her housework and get dressed to go in for her usual shift, but there wasn't anywhere to go anymore. People started spreading rumors that Radio Fresh was over.</p><p begin="00:54:25.71" data-timestamp="3265.71">Days passed. Nusra finally reached an agreement with Radio Fresh. They'd let Raed go and return the equipment, under a few conditions. First, that the radio station wouldn't play music. Here's Raed talking about the agreement. In English, actually, in an interview with the CBC.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Raed Fares</h4><p begin="00:54:43.20" data-timestamp="3283.2"> They started to say it's forbidden because it's haram in Islam shariah law.

You can move the ideas.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Ballout</h4><p begin="00:56:29.42" data-timestamp="3389.42"> Nusra's other big demand was for Radio Fresh to take women off the air completely.

And because the voice is so hard to listen to, Radio Fresh reduced how long women speak on the air to a fraction of what it was. By this past fall, the Assad regime had retaken swaths of the country. And in many other places, including Kafrenbel, extremists like Nusra were gaining power. People like Raed, people who didn't want Assad or the extremists, they barely held any ground.</p><p begin="00:57:57.42" data-timestamp="3477.42">And finally, around Thanksgiving, Raed was assassinated. I read the news in a tweet, and later heard the whole story. He was in a car with two colleagues from the radio station. It was around noon. A van pulled up next to them and shot and killed Raed and his friend Hamoud Junaid, then drove off.</p><p begin="00:58:17.41" data-timestamp="3497.41">While Nusra never claimed responsibility for the assassination, the whole town blamed them. Everyone I knew who had reported on Syria was talking about Raed that day, posting pictures of him, writing that his death was the end of the Syrian Revolution. Because Raed was one of a handful of people in Syria who was still living by the principles of the revolution.</p><p begin="00:58:36.97" data-timestamp="3516.97">He was still talking about non-violent resistance and democracy, civil society and freedom. Raed was there from the very first protests in Syria, and stuck by his principles while so many others either died or fell off the train. Now, he too was gone. Hiba got the news over WhatsApp.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hiba Abboud</h4><p begin="00:58:56.12" data-timestamp="3536.12"> [SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:58:57.65" data-timestamp="3537.65"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:59:01.45" data-timestamp="3541.45"> At that point, I just wasn't aware of anything anymore.

Hundreds of people came.
