  <h3>Act One: Currency of Dreams</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:02:15.37" data-timestamp="135.37">Act One, Currency of Dreams. The story of the crisis in Europe is really the story of the euro, that currency that almost all the countries in Europe share. But think about that for a second. Why did they ever do that? All these different countries with all these different cultures all deciding to share a currency. Imagine if the United States, if Mexico and Canada, all agreed, hey you know what? We're going to get rid of our own money and start a new money that we'll all share. Think about all the meetings that you would have to have, all the coordination, and for what? We have our own money now. It works fine. Why would we ever do that?</p><p begin="00:02:46.57" data-timestamp="166.57">Various <i>Planet</i> <i>Money</i> reporters have been making trips to Europe all year. And you're going to be hearing from them over the course of this hour. <i>Planet</i> <i>Money's</i> Chana Joffe-Walt will be telling the bulk of this story. And we're going to start at the beginning. We spent a lot of time talking to all sorts of people who were present at the creation of the euro, who dreamed and worked for years, decades, to make it happen. <i>Planet</i> <i>Money's</i> Chana Joffe-Walt and our colleague, Zoe Chace, tell the story of why they wanted it to happen and what they chose to ignore along the way.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:03:13.56" data-timestamp="193.56">History takes a long time to unfold in Europe. And the euro was that way. There were no euro coins or bills until 2002. But the dream of the euro had been around for 150 years.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:03:25.85" data-timestamp="205.85">But that's all it was-- a dream. The territory of artists, intellectuals, poets.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:03:31.93" data-timestamp="211.93">Yeah, Zoe read that thing from Victor Hugo, one of the very first calls for a united Europe.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:03:37.45" data-timestamp="217.45">OK, Victor Hugo, <i>Les Mis</i>, <i>Hunchback</i> <i>of</i> <i>Notre</i> <i>Dame,</i> here's an excerpt from a speech he gave in 1871. And keep in mind the actual Europe at this time is fighting a brutal war, tearing itself to pieces. OK here it is.</p><p begin="00:03:56.01" data-timestamp="236.01">&quot;And we shall hear France cry out, it's my turn Germany, here I am. Am I your enemy? No. I am your sister.&quot; And then he goes on to say, &quot;Let us be the same republic, let us be the United States of Europe, let us be the continental federation. Let us be European liberty. Let us be universal peace.&quot;</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:04:23.85" data-timestamp="263.85">It's nice, right? I keep thinking that the euro for all these years is kind of like Esperanto. You remember Esperanto, the international language? It'd be really easy to learn. We'd all pick it up and speak one tongue across borders and then there'd be international peace and understanding. The dream of the euro was kind of like that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:04:43.51" data-timestamp="283.51">But let me ask you, do you speak Esperanto today? No. Do nearly 332 million people carry euros in their pockets? Yes. So what happened?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pascal Lamy</h4><p begin="00:04:55.95" data-timestamp="295.95">World War II was such a catastrophe.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:05:01.24" data-timestamp="301.24">This is Pascale Lamy, the right-hand man to the father of the euro, Jacques Delors. Delors is old now. He's too old to give interviews. But Lamy was there at the key turning point when the euro stopped being a quixotic dream and started looking like a real necessity.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pascal Lamy</h4><p begin="00:05:19.75" data-timestamp="319.75">It's just after the Second World War that the notion of integrating Europe politically became a serious political idea. Before that it had been dreams.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:05:33.86" data-timestamp="333.86">But after World War II it was being talked about in two of Europe's most powerful nations-- in France by people like Lamy-- he went on to head the World Trade Organization. And in Germany by people like Helmut Schlesinger, former president of the German Central Bank.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Helmut Schlesinger</h4><p begin="00:05:49.09" data-timestamp="349.09">One cannot forget that the whole strength of having a European Union is based on the fact that we never want to have war between our countries, which we have had so much and so terrible.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:06:05.47" data-timestamp="365.47">Germany no longer wanted to dominate Europe. It wanted the opposite, actually. It wanted to be a team player, a peacemaker. Germany wanted to be the nicest guy at the European table.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:06:15.93" data-timestamp="375.93">Of course, France didn't want Germany to dominate either. Germany would always be bigger, more powerful. So France wanted to link its economy to the German economy. That way Germany's strength would be France's strength.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:06:30.02" data-timestamp="390.02">And also, a united Europe would be big enough and rich enough to become the world's other superpower and rival the United States, which both countries liked. All this was making a once-poetic dream much more appealing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:06:48.43" data-timestamp="408.43">But of course there were problems. Two main problems-- one German, one French. For the Germans, the whole sharing a currency thing made them very nervous. They worried it would lead to inflation.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:07:00.34" data-timestamp="420.34">And Germans are really scared of inflation. It calls up a bad memory-- the hyperinflation of the 1920s, the worst bout of hyperinflation in recent history. You may have heard about Germans carting their money around in wheelbarrows or using worthless German Marks to wallpaper their homes. Many people in Germany feel like it was this experience that opened the door for the Nazis to come to power.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:07:22.72" data-timestamp="442.72">I was reporting on the euro crisis in Berlin a couple months ago, and it shocked me how readily Germans would bring up the hyperinflation of the '20s when talking about their problems today. Klaus Frankenberger is an editor at the German newspaper, the <i>FAZ</i>.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Klaus Frankenberger</h4><p begin="00:07:37.13" data-timestamp="457.13">I mean Germany is always stability minded as you know. Order, stability, that's part of our collective DNA I would say. But these historical experience tell every policy maker, you don't mess around with inflation. Never. You don't do this.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:07:52.02" data-timestamp="472.02">So Germany's position in the decades-long conversation that led to the euro was this-- if Europe wants to have a single currency, then we can't have all these separate governments out there. We need to become what Victor Hugo dreamed of, a United States of Europe. But the Germans wanted this, not for poetry, but to keep inflation in check. They wanted an overarching authority that can say to individual countries, here is how to run your economy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:08:19.78" data-timestamp="499.78">Can you imagine France no longer its own country but a member state in a united federation of Europe? Yeah, the French couldn't either. Again, here's Pascal Lamy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pascal Lamy</h4><p begin="00:08:30.05" data-timestamp="510.05">The French like Europe if Europe is a big France. That is something that they drive, something that doesn't bite too much into the French sovereignty. It took 30 years of discussion.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:08:52.35" data-timestamp="532.35">So for 30 years the French and the German were saying to each other, the Germans were saying, well what about our Deutsche Mark and the French were saying, well what about our national identity?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pascal Lamy</h4><p begin="00:09:02.68" data-timestamp="542.68">They were not always saying this. Because diplomats and governments don't always say what they have in mind. But that's what they had in mind.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:09:14.43" data-timestamp="554.43">And it could have gone on like this, haggling back and forth over these issues, until this happened--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male News Reporter</h4><p begin="00:09:20.59" data-timestamp="560.59">From the Berlin Wall, take a look at them. They've been there since last night. They are here in the thousands. They are here in the 10s of thousands. Occasionally they shout, &quot;Die Mauer muss weg,&quot; the wall must go.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:09:31.57" data-timestamp="571.57">In 1989 the wall separating East and West Germany was about to fall, and the Germans wanted French support for their reunification. The rest of Europe was still a bit wary of Germany. When you plunge the world into one of the bloodiest wars in history it's kind of hard to live that down. And here, Germany was about to grow even larger. So France said, OK, you can have our support if we all go on the euro.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:09:56.22" data-timestamp="596.22">And the French got their way. There would be a common currency but no United States of Europe, as the Germans wanted.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:10:03.30" data-timestamp="603.3">What the Germans got were promises, promises that all the countries that used the same money would play by German rules. They would guard against inflation. If a country wanted in on this common currency, the euro, they would have to borrow responsibly, be careful about their deficits. In other words, to use the euro, the rest of Europe would need to make itself more German.</p><p begin="00:10:25.90" data-timestamp="625.9">The rest of Europe seemed very happy to do just that, even if for many countries in Europe, becoming more German was a completely unrealistic dream. Nowhere more unrealistic than in Greece.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Loukas Tsoukalis</h4><p begin="00:10:38.84" data-timestamp="638.84">Our inflation rate was much higher than what was accepted, our budget deficit was much higher than what was accepted.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:10:45.25" data-timestamp="645.25">This is Loukas Tsoukalis with the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy in Athens.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Loukas Tsoukalis</h4><p begin="00:10:50.68" data-timestamp="650.68">If you asked somebody in Europe whether Greece would join in the Eurozone, and you asked that question let's say, in early, mid-1990s, the answer would have been, you are mad. Because all Greek indicators were far off. No chance in your lifetime.</p><p begin="00:11:18.14" data-timestamp="678.14">When the European Statistical service produced graphs which showed all the different countries in terms of inflation rates, in terms of interest rates, very often Greece appeared in an insert because it couldn't fit in the graph. Because if your inflation rate is 20, it doesn't fit in a normal graph. So you either have a big graph but it doesn't show anything or you have a reasonable graph and then you have inserts.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:11:46.58" data-timestamp="706.58">Greece is over here?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Loukas Tsoukalis</h4><p begin="00:11:47.53" data-timestamp="707.53">Yeah, but Greece was not the only country, but it was one of the worst, and usually the worst.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:11:56.20" data-timestamp="716.2">Still, Greece began a national campaign to make it in. And other countries were doing the same.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:12:02.03" data-timestamp="722.03">Willingly, even if it means pain. For instance, Italy. Their deficit was too high so the Italian prime minister at the time, Romano Prodi, said we need a new tax to cut it down. If we want into the euro we have to pay. Beppe Severgnini the Italian journalist, who was there at the time. And he talked to our colleague, Alex Blumberg.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Beppe Severgnini</h4><p begin="00:12:22.07" data-timestamp="742.07">The mood was so enthusiastic that when Romano Prodi proposed a tax in order to sort out our public finances people-- would you believe that-- sort of put up the money. And didn't-- not only didn't moan-- they said, well that's something we have to do. We'll do it. And it was a kind of hefty tax. I remember that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:12:41.35" data-timestamp="761.35"> And what was the dream? What were they paying for? In the minds of the average Italian, what did it represent, being part of the euro?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Beppe Severgnini</h4><p begin="00:12:50.53" data-timestamp="770.53">Well, to be in this sort premiere league of Europe, number one. Second, to have a stable currency, to be anchored the Deutsche Mark because it was obvious at the time-- and it still is obvious now-- that the engine for this all was Germany. So to have the same currency as Germany is good for everybody. So we want to be in that league and not in this sort of other league with weak local currencies.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:13:20.08" data-timestamp="800.08">For Greece and Italy and Portugal and even for France, the euro meant a more stable, more prosperous, more German existence.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:13:29.28" data-timestamp="809.28">And so in the years leading up to the euro, countries cut spending, reduced deficits. The numbers started to look, at least on paper, a lot more German.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:13:38.02" data-timestamp="818.02">So much so that in some cases it was a little hard to believe.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:13:42.11" data-timestamp="822.11">Cases like Greece.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:13:43.42" data-timestamp="823.42">In the late '90s all across Europe, finance ministers and their deputies would meet. They'd gather around tables in Brussels and Paris and Berlin with their rules in hand. And the Greeks were there reporting their data that they'd made it. They'd met the criteria for euro membership.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:14:00.00" data-timestamp="840">According to several people in these meetings, typically here is how it would go-- The Germans or the French would say, we have these rules. Every country has to meet the criteria. Yes, we do, the Greeks would respond. There would be glances around the table. It sure is a good thing we have these rules, someone would say. More glances. Jacob Kirkegaard is at with the Peterson Institute for International Economics and he followed these meetings closely.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jacob Kirkegaard</h4><p begin="00:14:25.85" data-timestamp="865.85">The leaders of France and Germany and others couldn't really stand up and say, look our data are superior. You are lying, basically, about these data. And that's why we will not let you join the euro.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pascal Lamy</h4><p begin="00:14:41.50" data-timestamp="881.5">We all knew and we all know now and we all knew at the time that Greece was fudging its statistics.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:14:47.37" data-timestamp="887.37">Pascal Lamy, right-hand man to the father of the euro, says it wasn't just the Greeks. People had questions about the Italians, other countries, too. But nobody actually said that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pascal Lamy</h4><p begin="00:14:58.19" data-timestamp="898.19">Because that would have been too un-nice to some of their colleagues in the country. There remains a level of diplomatic correctness and politeness.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:15:08.79" data-timestamp="908.79">So nobody challenged the Greeks because they were trying to be polite?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pascal Lamy</h4><p begin="00:15:14.29" data-timestamp="914.29">Exactly it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:15:15.58" data-timestamp="915.58">That's so crazy. It just sounds so crazy now. I mean, I understand at the time that might have made sense, but it sounds crazy now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pascal Lamy</h4><p begin="00:15:26.21" data-timestamp="926.21">Quite. That's the definition. You just gave a very good definition of a mistake. Something you believe is not a problem and then you realize, whooo, I shouldn't have done that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:15:48.19" data-timestamp="948.19">There was one other thing keeping all these countries around the table from voicing their objections-- money. Remember the poorer countries in Europe wanted the benefit of a strong, stable German currency. And Germany wanted customers.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:16:02.61" data-timestamp="962.61">Germany makes cars, appliances, high-tech precision machines, lots of stuff. And hundreds of millions of Europeans with the same currency, a strong currency, meant hundreds of millions of customers that just got a lot richer. The more regular people in Greece who could buy a Mercedes, the better for Germany.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:16:21.05" data-timestamp="981.05">It would be better for everyone. Together, the feeling was, they'd all be more prosperous than they would be on their own. And so, a new currency was born.</p></div>  </div>

Plenty were out to celebrate its arrival.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female</h4><p begin="00:17:20.63" data-timestamp="1040.63">I think that it brings the countries-- the euro brings them closer together.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female</h4><p begin="00:17:26.09" data-timestamp="1046.09">I think at the beginning there were many problems.

And then we'll be in France again the day after, and again it'll be the same money. It's magic. It's just got to be the way to go.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:17:41.85" data-timestamp="1061.85">People in the US, if we remember the debut of the euro at all, it's with this, oh yeah, that happened, sort of feeling. It's hard to understand what the excitement was all about. But as Chana Joffe-Walt explains, in large parts of Europe the euro didn't just change the money, it transformed the way people lived.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:17:56.37" data-timestamp="1076.37">A few months before the euro arrived in Greece, Theophilus Papakostakus was called into a meeting. Theophilus is a bank teller. And this wasn't unusual. The manager was often calling meetings, usually to talk about the overtime policy or some new paperwork requirements, but this was different.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Theophilus Papakostakus</h4><p begin="00:18:13.26" data-timestamp="1093.26">So one day after work he got us together and, among other things, he said, you should forget what you know. Soon enough you'll forget everything you know about banking. Everything is going to be all new. Soon it's going to be like a supermarket. People will come in and buy all kind of different things. Banking is not going to be only deposit, saving money. It's going to be retail. I specifically remember that expression, retail banking.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:18:50.22" data-timestamp="1130.22">And when he said that, what did you think?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Theophilus Papakostakus</h4><p begin="00:18:51.69" data-timestamp="1131.69">Well, we laughed. I said, yeah, sure. I'm sure, yeah. Well, it did happen.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:18:57.74" data-timestamp="1137.74">Every morning after that, Theophilus would come into work, turn on his computer, and the interest rate on consumer loans would be lower. 18% then 15%, 12%, 6%, 4%. Now the reasons why this was happening, we'll get to in a minute. I first just want to talk about the sheer fact that it was happening and what that fact meant.</p><p begin="00:19:19.88" data-timestamp="1159.88">Imagine if your mortgage rate went from 18% to 4%. Or the rate that you could get on a car loan. Most people in Greece never borrowed money to pay for anything before, and now they had people essentially throwing money at them. Theophilus bought two cars. His neighbors bought a vacation home. The neighbors on the other side of the street took out a loan for their vacation and then refinanced that loan. Really, everyone I met in Greece has a story like this. My cab driver, Adonis Barkolis, in Athens.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adonis Barkolis</h4><p begin="00:19:49.77" data-timestamp="1189.77">I used to own a Toyota, and in 2004 I bought  this.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:19:55.14" data-timestamp="1195.14">What's this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adonis Barkolis</h4><p begin="00:19:56.46" data-timestamp="1196.46">A Mercedes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:19:59.48" data-timestamp="1199.48">A black Mercedes. The bar that I went to used to have just two restaurants. In 2003 it became an industrial brewery, too.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Restaurant Owner</h4><p begin="00:20:09.54" data-timestamp="1209.54">Well for us, this is fantastic. 2002, when we started the building our industrial brewery, in total we have invested about 7 million euro, which is close to $10 million, which is a big amount of money for our company. And this is when we get out of the banks and the interest is very good. We were able to borrow money at 4.5%, which is excellent.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:20:31.33" data-timestamp="1231.33">And it wasn't just private citizens taking advantage of the low rates. Loukas Tsoukalis at the Hellenic Foundation says most importantly the Greek government got in on the action. Mainly by returning to a favorite practice of Greek politicians, addressing unemployment by hiring people.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Loukas Tsoukalis</h4><p begin="00:20:48.99" data-timestamp="1248.99">In the last two years they employed a large number of people in the Greek public sector. So they added to the salary bill.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:20:57.85" data-timestamp="1257.85">Doing what?

Or you create mythical jobs.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:21:03.81" data-timestamp="1263.81">What's the craziest thing you remember hearing of?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Loukas Tsoukalis</h4><p begin="00:21:07.08" data-timestamp="1267.08">I think there's, for example, an organization which was set up for the drying up of a lake. I think the lake has been dried up for the last 30 years, but the organization is still there. So there are a few employees who are paid for something that is not even remembered in a history book.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:21:33.55" data-timestamp="1293.55">The euro had arrived. And cheap money was flowing into countries all over Europe-- Ireland, Portugal, Spain. There was money for projects which never would have gotten funded before. Luis Garicano is a Spanish economist and he told me about this tiny little bank that funded a big project in La Mancha, Spain.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Luis Garicano</h4><p begin="00:21:51.84" data-timestamp="1311.84">Your listeners will know La Mancha as the area where Don Quixote lived. And it's as empty as it was in the time of Don Quixote. It's a big plain. Imagine it as completely empty. And in the middle of that plane there is an airport, to which nobody wants to fly.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:22:06.31" data-timestamp="1326.31">Is that airport open now?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Luis Garicano</h4><p begin="00:22:08.57" data-timestamp="1328.57">It's a potato field. I mean, it's really only suitable for growing potatoes. That terrain is really never going to be a commercial airport.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:22:17.62" data-timestamp="1337.62">And yet, there is an airport. The local people wanted one, and the euro gave it to them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Claudia Farmier</h4><p begin="00:22:28.06" data-timestamp="1348.06">It was like the manna from heaven.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:22:31.26" data-timestamp="1351.26">This is Claudia Farmier back in Greece. I met her at a brunch up north, actually at the bank teller's house, Theophilus. Remember the guy was called into the meeting, pre-euro? He invited me to his house. And there, nearly a decade after the euro had arrived, his friends are sitting around just reviewing how everything did really change.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Theophilus Papakostakus</h4><p begin="00:22:50.46" data-timestamp="1370.46">One day everybody thinks, this is paradise, let's go get everything. That's what happened.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:22:59.62" data-timestamp="1379.62">But why now? But why, one year do you not have any money to buy cars and vacations and homes and then the next year you have everything you could possibly want?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Claudia Farmier</h4><p begin="00:23:11.84" data-timestamp="1391.84">Maybe he knows.

I don't know.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:23:24.54" data-timestamp="1404.54">Hey, Chana?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:23:25.49" data-timestamp="1405.49">So this is Adam Davidson with <i>Planet</i> <i>Money</i>.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:23:28.88" data-timestamp="1408.88">I think I can help you. Because I actually do know who lent all that money to Greece and all the other people in Europe. I actually was in the room where they did it. The room is in Southern California, in Newport Beach. It's this huge room. And it's all these hundreds of people sitting at these long tables, each of them is looking at three or four computer screens-- one guy had six computer screens-- with all these numbers flashing on them. Although when you're there, if you closed your eyes you'd have no idea that there were that many people there.</p><p begin="00:24:00.53" data-timestamp="1440.53">This is the quietest room of 200 people I've ever been in. It's a little noisier than usual right now.</p><p begin="00:24:07.27" data-timestamp="1447.27">This is the trading floor of a company called PIMCO. And I would guess most of our listeners have not heard of PIMCO, but I can guarantee that every finance minister of every country in the world definitely has. Because PIMCO is one of the largest bond fund managers in the world. That means they are one of the biggest lenders of money to governments all over the world.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:24:30.23" data-timestamp="1470.23">And Adam, let me just jump in for people who need a refresher. Buying a bond is the same as lending someone money. You buy a bond for $1 million from someone with the promise that they're going to pay you back in full, with interest, over some period of time. So buying a Greek bond for $1 million, that's the same exact thing as loaning $1 million to the Greek government.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:24:49.98" data-timestamp="1489.98">Yeah, it's like an IOU. And all these people with all their computer screens spend their time figuring out, well which bonds should we buy? Which governments, and also companies, should we lend money to? Now the people at PIMCO, the people at these desks, it's not their money. They're watching over it for a while. They're money managers, managing the money for insurance companies, pension funds.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:25:11.74" data-timestamp="1511.74">If you have a retirement account, they might be managing your money. They manage savings for central banks, universities, basically anybody with a huge amount of cash sitting around.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:25:21.54" data-timestamp="1521.54">And if you add up all the money they manage, it's over a trillion dollars. And they don't want to lose any of it. They are looking for safe, sensible governments to lend money to. And for several years, after the turn of the millennium, one of the countries PIMCO decided, oh now they're safe, they're sensible, was Greece.</p><p begin="00:25:39.41" data-timestamp="1539.41">Scott Mather is the guy who runs the global portfolio for PIMCO, and he says basically overnight Greece went from a bad bet to a sure thing. And the reason was the euro. Because of the euro, Scott and all the other money managers for other companies all over the world completely changed how they looked at Greece. It was no longer just one small, poor dysfunctional country in a corner of Europe. It was now a full member in good standing of one of the largest economies in the world. The Eurozone.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scott Mather</h4><p begin="00:26:09.47" data-timestamp="1569.47">The market was basically giving Greece a benefit of the doubt because they were a Eurozone member, part of the club, for the better part of a decade.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:26:19.04" data-timestamp="1579.04">Going on the euro for a lot of countries was like getting a rich uncle to cosign a mortgage or a credit card application. Greece, Spain, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, all were allowed to borrow a lot more money at much lower interest rates than they had been before.</p><p begin="00:26:33.14" data-timestamp="1593.14">And that, Chana, that is why your cab driver could get a cheap loan to buy a Mercedes. It's why a sleepy bank in La Mancha, Spain, could build an airport. And it's why Irish banks grew several times larger than the entire economy of Ireland.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:26:47.68" data-timestamp="1607.68">And then, quite suddenly, everything changed.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:26:50.58" data-timestamp="1610.58">Yes. It  all changed one day when, Chana, your people in Greece made a shocking announcement.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:26:55.56" data-timestamp="1615.56">Well, Adam, your people in Newport Beach, that was quite a dramatic reaction, don't you think?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:27:00.05" data-timestamp="1620.05">We'll get to that.</p></div>  </div>

He's really smart. And then everywhere people are selling their Greek bonds. And what really struck me is how imbalanced things are. For PIMCO it's just not that big a deal to sell all their Greek, Portuguese and Spanish bonds. It's a few clicks on a keyboard, moving around a relatively small amount of their overall money. But for the countries whose bonds they're selling, it feels a lot more like the end of the world.</p><p begin="00:30:55.21" data-timestamp="1855.21">Soon the Greek government had some new bonds they wanted to sell.

So we were in the middle of Act Three, which began, remember with fireworks commemorating the euro's debut January 1, 2002. There were people all over Europe celebrating, saying this new currency's like magic. We all now know of course that the euro hasn't been working out so great. But there's this amazing moment in that BBC story from 2002, the reporter, Justin Webb, finishes his report and the anchor asks him one follow-up question. And Justin Webb proceeds to almost perfectly predict the future.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bbc Anchor</h4><p begin="00:34:49.42" data-timestamp="2089.42">Justin, when will it be possible to judge whether the changeover has been a success?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Justin Webb</h4><p begin="00:34:55.83" data-timestamp="2095.83">Well the short answer is not today and not in a few days to come, either. Although there is a positive mood, it really us nothing about the long-term future. We will only know whether this currency is a success when there is a severe economic shock in one Eurozone nation and the other nations rally round and the currency survives. That is some time in the future. So a positive mood today and that is helpful, but the jury is still out.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:35:19.76" data-timestamp="2119.76">Truer words were never spoken, Justin. The economic shock has arrived in Europe. And it's spreading. Here's Adam Davidson and Chana Joffe-Walt to pick the story back up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:35:27.62" data-timestamp="2127.62">When the Greek government made its shocking announcement about its huge deficit numbers in 2009, that is when the euro turns from a blessing to a curse. When times are good, the strongest country can make everybody stronger. But when times are bad, the weakest country can bring everybody down. Remember what Mohamed El-Erian, the CEO of PIMCO, said he did around the time of that announcement?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mohamed El-erian</h4><p begin="00:35:50.42" data-timestamp="2150.42">In the end of last year we sold all our Greek, Portuguese and Spanish exposure.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:35:57.54" data-timestamp="2157.54">In other words, we're going to stop lending to Greece. But we're also going to stop lending to Portugal and Spain. Now Portugal and Spain, they didn't lie about their deficits. In the case of Spain, they'd actually been pretty conservative throughout the decade in the way they handled their finances.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:36:10.98" data-timestamp="2170.98">But when Greece made that announcement, it shattered the image of the Eurozone for people like El-Erian. Instead of seeing all the euro countries as the same-- safe, boring, basically Germany-- they saw them all as opposite. They went back to being what they were before-- individual countries with individual problems. Some looked like a safe bet to loan money to, others, maybe they'd get their money back but maybe they wouldn't. And for those countries, the ones they were worried about, it just gets harder and harder to find anyone to lend them money.</p><p begin="00:36:43.24" data-timestamp="2203.24">It started with Greece, and then--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Reporter</h4><p begin="00:36:45.25" data-timestamp="2205.25">The European debt crisis showing no signs of easing yet. The S&amp;P credit raters say they might downgrade Portugal's credit rating.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Reporter</h4><p begin="00:36:53.81" data-timestamp="2213.81">Spanish 10-year bond yields fair now at their highest level since 2002 as Eurozone contagion fears continue to ramp up. Pressure on Spain--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Reporter</h4><p begin="00:37:01.52" data-timestamp="2221.52">Whether it's Italy one day or Spain the next. Today it's Belgium.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Reporter</h4><p begin="00:37:04.93" data-timestamp="2224.93">I mean, look at that move. Whoa. It kind of leaves me speechless.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Reporter</h4><p begin="00:37:10.73" data-timestamp="2230.73">And so there's another one we're going to have to start to worry about. Yes indeed, and the spread by the way in terms of what Belgium's able to borrow at--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:37:16.40" data-timestamp="2236.4">It used to be, before the euro, when times were bad in Greece or Italy or Portugal, when those countries got themselves too deep into debt, they could do something about it. They could create money. They could create drachmas or liras, escudos, and essentially use that money to pay off their debts.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:37:32.73" data-timestamp="2252.73">But now that Greece and Italy and Portugal were part of the euro, it was no longer up to them to create more money. It was up to the institution that controls the euro, the European Central Bank. And when the European Central Bank was created, the Germans insisted-- or else they would not join the euro-- that the European Central Bank would not do anything that might risk inflation. And creating a lot of euros so that the Greeks and Portuguese could pay off their debts, that definitely risked inflation. So the troubled countries of Europe were stuck.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act Four: Do-Over</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:38:12.48" data-timestamp="2292.48">Act Four, Do-over. It's been over two years since the Greeks made that shocking announcement about their deficit number, and the crisis has been spreading throughout Europe ever since. European leaders have tried a variety plans to fix things. And typically, there's a big announcement about a new solution, things stabilize for a day or two, maybe a week, and then everything gets worse than it was before.</p><p begin="00:38:32.07" data-timestamp="2312.07">But then, just last month, December 9, 2011, the Europeans came to an interesting-- and what they described as-- final plan. The plan was essentially correct the original sin of the euro. Give the rules-- those rules all the Eurozone countries are supposed to follow but didn't follow-- give those rules actual teeth. If countries break the rules, European leaders will send in a SWAT team of technocrats to come in and take over.</p><p begin="00:38:57.50" data-timestamp="2337.5">So now governments in Spain, Italy, Ireland, are scrambling to bring their budgets in line with these rules-- cutting down debt, trying to make themselves seem safe, dependable, trustworthy. Trying to make themselves seem like the kind of countries the world would be happy to lend money to.</p><p begin="00:39:12.68" data-timestamp="2352.68">It seems like a straightforward plan. And the obvious place to start would be Greece. That was where the crisis first started and indeed, European technocrats schooled in the German mindset are already there trying to fix things. Chana Joffe-Walt went to see how it's going so far.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:39:27.49" data-timestamp="2367.49">The very first place the technocrats went was 46 Pireos Street, the Greek Statistics Office, the very building the crisis began in. You remember the guys who reported, whoops, the Greek government deficit is actually twice what we said before and then offered this confidence inspiring explanation of what happened.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Konstantinos Skordas</h4><p begin="00:39:46.82" data-timestamp="2386.82">Nobody knows.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:39:48.39" data-timestamp="2388.39">This is Konstantinos Skordas. You can think of him as sort of the Greek old guard. He, like the majority of his colleagues here, have worked in the Statistics Office for decades. In the summer of 2010, a European technocrat arrived in the building to lead the Greek old guard into this new European world. His name Andreas Georgiou. He's Greek, but he's been living abroad for decades. And he's kind of a no-nonsense numbers guy, the guy who opens an interview by telling you he'd prefer you disappear.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andreas Georgiou</h4><p begin="00:40:19.98" data-timestamp="2419.98">My goal is to make this a competent, boring institution and not to be in the limelight. Actually not to have to give an interview like this one.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:40:31.01" data-timestamp="2431.01">Georgiou has obviously not yet achieved his goal because here I am to find out why he hasn't. Because, quite frankly, his job seems kind of easy. All he has to do is produce a couple numbers-- one number, really. The real deficit number for 2009. And just that one job is not going well.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andreas Georgiou</h4><p begin="00:40:52.24" data-timestamp="2452.24">Things appear to be difficult, actually, in some areas from the very beginning.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:40:58.98" data-timestamp="2458.98">In the very beginning, August, 2010, Georgiou arrived and got straight to the numbers. He was going to calculate the true deficit number. Investors were going to see Greece has this new bureaucrat at the helm. Faith would be restored. But within a few minutes of sitting down with the data, Georgiou realized, this is going to take a while.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andreas Georgiou</h4><p begin="00:41:17.78" data-timestamp="2477.78">In order to be able to count what is the deficit and the debt, you have to know what you are counting. You have to know which institutions belong in this concept called government. So that was, for example, an open question.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:41:30.07" data-timestamp="2490.07">You might think what is part of government and what is not part of government should be pretty clear. It was not. Georgiou sifted through spreadsheets, and the first thing he found was a national train company that just wasn't included anywhere in the numbers. Then he found a national TV company, then a tourism organization.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andreas Georgiou</h4><p begin="00:41:47.20" data-timestamp="2507.2">We found 17 institutions, large institutions, were left out.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:41:54.12" data-timestamp="2514.12">Why would they have been  left out?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andreas Georgiou</h4><p begin="00:41:57.95" data-timestamp="2517.95">I did not know. But this is, you asked me what I found. In principle this should not happen.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:42:08.74" data-timestamp="2528.74">And finally, at the end of 2010, Georgiou and his staff had a new deficit number to report to Eurostat, to the European Statistical Agency. Greek 2009 government deficit, final number-- 15.8% Now 15.8%, that's even higher than the number that set off the debt crisis. But Eurostat praised his methodology. They blessed his number as true. They said, finally we have a real, grown-up number.</p><p begin="00:42:37.66" data-timestamp="2557.66">Meanwhile the Greek old guard? They weren't so happy. People like Konstantinos Skordas didn't like having their previous work criticized. They didn't like the new guy, and they definitely didn't like his new deficit number.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Konstantinos Skordas</h4><p begin="00:42:51.13" data-timestamp="2571.13">Everybody said, oh what number is this? We expected to discuss this matter, some peculiar words he told to us. And we had a lot of questions about it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:43:05.52" data-timestamp="2585.52">Skordas and several others in the Greek old guard insisted that a Statistics Office board should have been consulted. In fact, the Greeks in this building, they said, should be involved in anything that gets reported to European authorities about how Greece is doing, especially a deficit number. They argued, they should get to vote. Georgiou, the technocrat, he saw this as a threat to his independence. He told them, you don't get to vote on this. The number is the number.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andreas Georgiou</h4><p begin="00:43:32.72" data-timestamp="2612.72">But then something happened, which was absolutely shocking.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:43:35.98" data-timestamp="2615.98">Georgiou says a few weeks after he sent the new deficit number to Eurostat, a colleague of Skordas, a prominent member of the Greek old guard, send him a note and asked to see him. Georgiou says the two met in a small room, adjacent to his office, and the guy from the Greek old guard sat across from Georgiou on the couch.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andreas Georgiou</h4><p begin="00:43:53.69" data-timestamp="2633.69">And presented me with a document that only existed in an email communication between me and my lawyer through my personal email.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:44:04.77" data-timestamp="2644.77">What did you say?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andreas Georgiou</h4><p begin="00:44:08.36" data-timestamp="2648.36">I didn't say that he has hacked into my emails. I said that this is a product of a criminal act. And the answer that I got was that things like that happen.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:44:22.08" data-timestamp="2662.08">Things like what happen?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andreas Georgiou</h4><p begin="00:44:24.18" data-timestamp="2664.18">That things that are in my personal email could find their way around. He said, things like that happen in Greece. And I told him that, no, they don't happen in my country, or at least they shouldn't happen in my country.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:44:41.72" data-timestamp="2681.72">The old guard, including the man accused, deny this ever happened. And then the Statistics Office workers went on strike against the technocrat, against Georgiou. Twice they striked. Mathematicians and accountants holding signs, walking a picket line. At one point they occupied the building so no one could get in. And then, last fall, Andreas Georgiou got a phone call from a Greek government official.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andreas Georgiou</h4><p begin="00:45:07.58" data-timestamp="2707.58">The Prosecutor for Economic Crimes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:45:10.27" data-timestamp="2710.27">The prosecutor, Georgiou says, explained that the office planned to clarify the contested 2009 deficit number and he wanted Georgiou's help. Georgiou says he sent over 75 boxes of documents, documents which explained exactly how he came up with his real number.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andreas Georgiou</h4><p begin="00:45:27.02" data-timestamp="2727.02">And a few weeks after that I got another letter asking me to appear in front of the prosecutor. And to my surprise they asked me where my lawyer was. And I asked why I needed a lawyer, and they explained to me that I was being invited as a suspect not as a witness.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:45:51.01" data-timestamp="2751.01">In other words, Andreas Georgiou is being accused of a crime.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andreas Georgiou</h4><p begin="00:45:55.24" data-timestamp="2755.24">Something called breach of faith against the state.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jacob Kirkegaard</h4><p begin="00:46:02.55" data-timestamp="2762.55">To me, well there's no other word for it than insane.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:46:06.55" data-timestamp="2766.55">This again, is Jacob Kirkegaard with the Peterson Institute for International Economics. And Kirkegaard says members of the Greek old guard have alleged Georgiou is colluding with European leaders, that Georgiou deliberately made the deficit number high so Greece would look bad and European leaders could come in and run things the way they want to. Georgiou faces life in prison.</p><p begin="00:46:31.32" data-timestamp="2791.32">Remember, Kirkegaard says, this is the guy that was supposed to change the public image of the Statistics Office.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jacob Kirkegaard</h4><p begin="00:46:38.05" data-timestamp="2798.05">I mean, the worst thing you can do if you were trying to restore outside confidence is, of course, to indict the guy who has been trying to establish credible, defensible and truthful data.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:47:00.82" data-timestamp="2820.82">If this is the new plan to save the euro, send in the technocrat to fix things, it does not seem to be going well, at least not in Athens. The technocrat is harassed, his email hacked, he's accused of treason, and he faces life in prison. It is hard to make Greece Germany.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act Five: What's a Greek Accountant Got to Do With Me?</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:47:25.57" data-timestamp="2845.57">This brings us to Act Five, What's a Greek Accountant Got To Do With Me? The answer would normally be nothing. Greece is a pretty tiny country and every other country in the Eurozone is in much better shape than Greece. But that doesn't matter right now. You're going to be hearing a lot about Greece in the next couple of weeks and months. People will be talking about whether Greece can get some of its debt forgiven, whether Greece will get its next bailout. And the thing you need to keep in mind as you hear all this, what those people are really talking about when they're talking about Greece is Italy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:47:55.45" data-timestamp="2875.45">It feels like a big leap to go from Greece to Italy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:47:58.80" data-timestamp="2878.8">Yeah, Chana, it really does. And so let's just talk through this. I mean Greece in in much worse shape than Italy. But Italy is next in line. You remember worries about Greece cast the shadow on Portugal which then cast a shadow on Ireland and then Spain? At the end of last year it finally reached Italy. Suddenly Italy, like Greece and Portugal and Ireland and Spain before it, was having a harder and harder time finding anyone to lend it money at reasonable interest rates.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Reporter</h4><p begin="00:48:23.45" data-timestamp="2903.45">Italian bond yields hitting record levels today as investors expressed their concern about how and when the country will address its fiscal constraints.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:48:30.34" data-timestamp="2910.34">And this is the moment where the debt crisis took a really scary turn. Because Italy, Italy is enormous. Italy's the seventh-largest economy in the world.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Reporter</h4><p begin="00:48:40.34" data-timestamp="2920.34">Everybody knows Italy is a huge economy. If Italy starts teetering more than it already is, it's going to be an issue.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Reporter</h4><p begin="00:48:47.30" data-timestamp="2927.3">The situation in Italy is really now getting serious, and I think we are approaching a kind of systemic crisis right now that reminds very much to the situation in 2008.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:48:58.78" data-timestamp="2938.78">2008, you may remember, that's when the US economy fell apart. And this is why when people say they're worried about Greece, they're actually worried about Italy. Because Italy's destiny is now tied to the destiny of Greece.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:49:12.32" data-timestamp="2952.32">If our last financial crisis taught us anything, it's that relatively small defaults can have very large consequences. The last crisis began, you may remember, with the collapse of a pretty small investment bank, Lehman Brothers. A default in the tiny country of Greece could have similar catastrophic consequences, cause a chain reaction of defaults ending with Italy. Greece, Greece is the cigarette. Italy is the gas station.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:49:35.86" data-timestamp="2975.86">And this is where, if you're in the United States and you didn't already care, you might start to care.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:49:41.61" data-timestamp="2981.61">The United States seems finally to be on a slow, fragile path to recovery. Europe could kill that. It could slow it down. It could stop it. It could make things worse than they were before. Most days the crisis in Europe seems like this slow-moving mess that will eventually work itself out. But every once in a while the question arises, what if it doesn't? Satyajit Das is a risk consultant and former banker. He spent his life in finance, and he's been following the crisis closely. How scared are you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Satyajit Das</h4><p begin="00:50:13.07" data-timestamp="3013.07">I've been doing this for 34 years in financial markets. This is the first time in my life I actually am really worried. Because when you're talking about countries the size of Italy, this is really truly one of the scariest moments in my professional life.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:50:33.48" data-timestamp="3033.48">Das is scared because in his view, the new plan to save the euro is exactly the opposite of what should be happening. European leaders, he says, largely Germans, are still trying to get countries to obey their rules, those rules they set up back at the very beginning of the euro, to get countries like Greece to cut spending, bring in more in tax revenue, get their budget in line.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:50:55.24" data-timestamp="3055.24">But here is what happens when you cut spending and raise taxes-- the economy generally shrinks, especially in the middle of an economic crisis. In Spain, the unemployment rate has continued to rise. It's now over 20%. That is Great Depression territory. In Ireland and Portugal it's not much better. Most people think that all of Europe is in a recession right now. And the question is only, how bad will it get?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:51:17.57" data-timestamp="3077.57">I have to say, being in Greece, it really does feel like a country on the verge of falling apart. Do you remember Katarina Margaritu, the Greek chemist?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:51:25.68" data-timestamp="3085.68">The one who who went back and remembered, oh that's all those things that we spent money on that we couldn't afford?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:51:29.43" data-timestamp="3089.43">Right, my friend got a job, we got the subway system. So she actually works as a contractor for the Greek government. About a third of the Greek population relies on the government for a paycheck. And right now?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katarina Margaritu</h4><p begin="00:51:40.62" data-timestamp="3100.62">They don't pay us because they have no money. Truth is that the last paycheck I took was from July. So my company now owes me the salary from August, September, October, November and December. So I haven't been paid from July.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:52:04.01" data-timestamp="3124.01">So what keeps you going to work?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katarina Margaritu</h4><p begin="00:52:08.78" data-timestamp="3128.78">Well, I like my work. You see, every day we work we bring money to the company. So every time we bring money we are increasing the possibility to get paid.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:52:29.45" data-timestamp="3149.45">Do you think that you'll get paid the back pay?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katarina Margaritu</h4><p begin="00:52:32.80" data-timestamp="3152.8">Yes. I'm sure.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:52:35.85" data-timestamp="3155.85">Katerina's boyfriend, you can hear him in the background there, he is not so sure. Actually he is absolutely sure there is no way she will get paid. And I have to say I'm with the boyfriend on this.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:52:52.52" data-timestamp="3172.52">Europe today feels like a far cry from the dream of Victor Hugo, from that exciting scene at the launch of the euro with the fireworks and the people talking about magic. Germans worry now that they are on the hook for bailing out a huge section of the continent. Half of Germans now think that the euro was bad for Germany.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:53:09.91" data-timestamp="3189.91">And that question, whether or not the euro was a good idea, is on a lot of people's minds. It came up with Katarina in Athens.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katarina Margaritu</h4><p begin="00:53:16.64" data-timestamp="3196.64">Maybe it's better to go back to drachma.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:53:19.32" data-timestamp="3199.32">The drachma is Greece's old currency. But this idea, at least to her, is a painful one.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katarina Margaritu</h4><p begin="00:53:25.57" data-timestamp="3205.57">I like this whole European family. I like to be a member of this family. We have exchanged ideas and culture all these years being together. I don't want to leave them. It's my family now. But I don't like their currency.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:53:44.24" data-timestamp="3224.24">In the effort to keep the family together there is one other thing that gets talked about all the time as the only real true solution. Create money. Get the European Central Bank to make a bunch of new euros, which the troubled countries of Europe could use to pay off their debts.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:53:58.89" data-timestamp="3238.89">But the richest country in the club, the one that is calling all the shots right now, firmly does not want that. That country, of course, is Germany.
