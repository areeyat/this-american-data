  <h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:11.41" data-timestamp="11.41"> OK, so let's start here. This is a training video for firefighters in Amsterdam.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fireman 1</h4><p begin="00:00:16.43" data-timestamp="16.43"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fireman 2</h4><p begin="00:00:16.87" data-timestamp="16.87"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:00:17.97" data-timestamp="17.97"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:18.72" data-timestamp="18.72"> Three firemen in an office, drinking coffee, catching up-- and then, one of them, this big bald guy, gets up to show the others this new helmet that he's just gotten, picks up a box off the floor, and says, what is that? He makes a face. It stinks, too. He smells his fingers. What is that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fireman 1</h4><p begin="00:00:38.72" data-timestamp="38.72"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:39.94" data-timestamp="39.94"> It's pee. This conversation understandably turns to speculation on how the pee might have gotten there. "Where'd you find this?" he asks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fireman 1</h4><p begin="00:00:47.95" data-timestamp="47.95"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:00:48.77" data-timestamp="48.77"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fireman 2</h4><p begin="00:00:49.47" data-timestamp="49.47"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:50.29" data-timestamp="50.29"> At the depot.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fireman 1</h4><p begin="00:00:51.72" data-timestamp="51.72"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:52.54" data-timestamp="52.54"> Do you think it was a cat? It was not a cat.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fireman 2</h4><p begin="00:00:56.13" data-timestamp="56.13"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:57.25" data-timestamp="57.25"> The rest of the video, which is entitled "The Incident With the Helmet," goes on for a few minutes explaining why it is not a good idea to pee in your colleague's helmet, even if it's a joke. Like, that can make people feel bad, and unwelcome. And the reason the fire department needed a video like this was the firefighters were peeing in their co-workers helmets and their drinks, and had been for years.</p><p begin="00:01:24.07" data-timestamp="84.07">This was a re-enactment of an actual incident. Amsterdam firefighters had a kind of macho, frat house culture. And for women who came to work there, or anybody who wasn't white, it was rough in all kinds of ways-- pranks, bullying, racist jokes, sexist comments. Women described the environment as alienating. One Moroccan-Dutch firefighter said, "What we want is not super special. We just want normal behavior, normal treatment of people."</p><p begin="00:01:52.96" data-timestamp="112.96">The bosses had problems with them, too. The firefighters would simply ignore certain orders to change the way they worked. Back in 2011, the mayor of Amsterdam commanded them to do some straightforward things, like perform more home inspections, pass out smoke detectors, switch from 24-hour shifts to 8-hour shifts. A year passed, and another, and another. After five years-- still nothing. They'd pretty much blown off his requests.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Vughts</h4><p begin="00:02:17.97" data-timestamp="137.97"> The mayor didn't like to hear no.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:21.80" data-timestamp="141.8"> Paul Vughts is a reporter at Amsterdam's biggest newspaper, <i>Het</i> <i>Parool.</i> He's covered the fire department for over 20 years.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Vughts</h4><p begin="00:02:28.65" data-timestamp="148.65"> He put his fist on the table and said, "And now, it's over. And now, I'll send you a strong man. He'll change the fire brigade in the way I want it to change."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:37.71" data-timestamp="157.71"> The strong man the mayor brought in was a guy named Leen Schaap. His firefighting experience before this-- nothing. He spent his whole career working at the Amsterdam Police Department. And he wasn't just an outsider-- he was somebody with a reputation for being a real hard ass.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Vughts</h4><p begin="00:02:52.75" data-timestamp="172.75"> I expected a riot because the way they live in the fire stations, being all day and nights, they're together-- cook together, sleep together-- that makes, in the end, that outsiders don't get in easy. Here in Amsterdam, the fire stations are really like small castles in the neighborhood.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:16.87" data-timestamp="196.87"> There's 19 fire stations all around Amsterdam. There were 750 firefighters-- 500 full-time, 250 volunteer-- a brigade with the same problems as lots of brigades here in the United States. And for sure, not all firehouses are like this. But it's not hard to find examples.</p><p begin="00:03:33.85" data-timestamp="213.85">Outside of Chicago, male firefighters broke down their female co-worker's shower door while she was in there, showering. The chief handed her a towel and said, "Relax. It's firehouse fun." In Houston, women say their male co-workers peed on their beds, and when they complained, they were labeled troublemakers. The city could not substantiate those claims, but the Trump Justice Department has stepped in on the women's side. In Miami and New York, black fire department employees found nooses at work. In Michigan, a black firefighter found a banana on the windshield of his truck.</p><p begin="00:04:06.29" data-timestamp="246.29">Amsterdam is one of the rare examples of a city that really decides to take on the "boys club" culture in firehouses. And the firefighters don't lay down. They fight every step of the way. And one thing that's unusual about the guy running this department, Leen Schaap, is that he is shockingly frank about just how messed up his department really is. One of his tactics is to be utterly transparent, and show the public what he learns is happening behind the closed doors of the firehouses. He's also blunt about the pushback he gets.</p><p begin="00:04:36.08" data-timestamp="276.08">And so, unlike other fire departments and police departments with similar problems, in this case, for once, we see exactly how bad things were, laid bare. And we also see all the resistance when somebody comes in and tries to change it. We see just how hard that is to accomplish. It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass.</p><p begin="00:04:53.99" data-timestamp="293.99">Today on our show, we have this very unusual look inside a place like this. Reporter Joanna Kakissis has been digging into this for months. That'll be Act One of today's show. And this is such an embattled department that the only way Joanna could get most of the firefighters to talk to her was to change their names and replace their voices. So you're going to be hearing a bunch of that in what's about to follow. Basically, only Leen Schaap and one of his main opponents let us use their voices. Our producer, Miki Meek, reported this with Joanna. You'll hear Miki's voice in there, now and then, asking questions. Here's Joanna.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One: A Policeman Burns Down the Firehouse</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:05:25.61" data-timestamp="325.61"> To take on a bunch of tough guys, the mayor hired someone who was used to being the toughest guy in the room. Leen Schaap climbed to the upper ranks of the Amsterdam Police Department by speaking his mind, and not caring who didn't like it. He got things done by moving quickly and aggressively. He ran the riot squad. He was known in town for forcing out anarchists squatting in a full city block of abandoned homes. Amsterdam is a progressive city, and sympathy was with the squatters. Lots of people hated Leen for what he did. They threw paint bombs at him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:05:57.95" data-timestamp="357.95"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:05:59.18" data-timestamp="359.18"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:05:59.93" data-timestamp="359.93"> Only cowardly leaders don't show up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:06:02.18" data-timestamp="362.18"> My interviews with him are filled with these kind of tough guy cliches.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:06:05.82" data-timestamp="365.82"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:06:07.31" data-timestamp="367.31"> This is a battle, and one of us is going to win it. And it's not going to be you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:06:11.96" data-timestamp="371.96"> Sometimes, it was hard to keep a straight face.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:06:14.25" data-timestamp="374.25"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:06:15.28" data-timestamp="375.28"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:06:16.52" data-timestamp="376.52"> I'm in the fire department, so I'm not really worried about getting burned.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:06:20.26" data-timestamp="380.26"> OK. You're tough. You're tough.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:06:23.74" data-timestamp="383.74"> Leen smiled. He knows when he's laying it on thick. He's intense, with reddish-brown hair and blue eyes that look incredibly icy if you've pissed him off. His first week on the job, there's a welcome lunch for him. Firefighters don't show up. Then, he gets an anonymous letter telling him not to enter any fire stations. He goes anyway, and he notices right away there's nowhere for him to park. The fire station's parking spaces are filled with recreational vehicles.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:06:52.63" data-timestamp="412.63"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:06:53.98" data-timestamp="413.98"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:06:55.05" data-timestamp="415.05"> Boats with caravans, with camper vans-- because basically, the firefighters were using this area around the firehouse as their private space, saying, we're here 24 hours. This is kind of our house. This is our place.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:07:09.29" data-timestamp="429.29"> Leen gave firefighters their first order. He said, get all your personal stuff out of here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:07:14.69" data-timestamp="434.69"> Then, they said, you don't run the show. You are not the one who decides this.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:07:19.40" data-timestamp="439.4"> He actually said, "You don't run this."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:07:21.68" data-timestamp="441.68"> "You don't run this. What's your problem?" That's what I said. "What's your problem?"</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:07:26.41" data-timestamp="446.41"> And kind of belittling-- "why are you getting so worked up about this little boat we have?"</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:07:31.04" data-timestamp="451.04"> And what was your response to that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:07:36.31" data-timestamp="456.31"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:07:37.29" data-timestamp="457.29"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:07:39.80" data-timestamp="459.8"> I told them, you have to get these boats and the camper vans out of here. If not, I'm going to hire somebody to take all that stuff away. And they were like, oh, go ahead. And I took a step forward, and stood my ground. You know, I threatened to take a police crane and lift it out of there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:07:59.43" data-timestamp="479.43"> Firefighters were furious, and thought Leen was acting too much like an uptight cop. But everyone complied. They got rid of their boats and campers. Except for one guy, who ignored Leen and defiantly brought a boat right back-- the only boat in the parking lot. Leen put him on probation and moved him to another firehouse. It was one of his first disciplinary actions. The guy retaliated by not coming to work, and taking the department to court.</p><p begin="00:08:30.02" data-timestamp="510.02">Leen was figuring things out pretty fast. He estimated there were about 50 of these guys in the entire department-- guys who joined the brigade decades ago, and now ran their fire stations. They kept tabs on their bosses through a private Whatsapp channel. Some firefighters called them "The Brotherhood." Leen always called them--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:08:48.77" data-timestamp="528.77"> The angry white men. We still have them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:08:53.84" data-timestamp="533.84"> Angry white men, he says, who are against any change that would force them out of their golden cages. He knew guys exactly like this in his police department days.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:09:02.65" data-timestamp="542.65"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:09:03.80" data-timestamp="543.8"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:09:07.26" data-timestamp="547.26"> These are tough guys, some born and raised in Amsterdam, or in the streets. They're built like a refrigerator. They have lots of tattoos. They have a big mouth. They're not so much super smart, but they're cunning. And if you try to approach them with too much nuance, then you're not going to make it, because they know how to play you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:09:29.82" data-timestamp="569.82"> And then, a few months into his job, Moroccan-Dutch firefighters on the force started coming to him about a particular guy, one of The Brotherhood, who called them "cancer Moroccans." In Dutch, this is a racial slur. When I asked for an English equivalent, someone told me "cancer Moroccan" is like saying "fucking Moroccan scum."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:09:48.81" data-timestamp="588.81"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:09:50.12" data-timestamp="590.12"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:09:51.57" data-timestamp="591.57"> And also, when he was supposed to put out fires in Amsterdam-West, where there's a lot of Muslims living, he would say that he had to go to the caliphate.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:09:59.43" data-timestamp="599.43"> This guy had a long list of charges against him. He walked around in a Nazi jacket, he threatened to nail a crucifix to the shower door of a Muslim firefighter, and he refused to go to a fire drill at a mosque. Again, Leen--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:10:12.60" data-timestamp="612.6"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:10:13.98" data-timestamp="613.98"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:10:16.29" data-timestamp="616.29"> This is really wrong. What if there's a fire in a mosque? Will he do his job? Will he save the people if he doesn't want to go in there now, for the practice? And as a first responder in this multicultural city, you can't say that you don't want to go somewhere because of religion.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:10:30.82" data-timestamp="630.82"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:10:31.59" data-timestamp="631.59"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:10:36.51" data-timestamp="636.51"> So when I heard about this case, I thought, I have to do something about this. I can't lead this life.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:10:42.96" data-timestamp="642.96"> Leen fired him. It was the first time racism had been cited as a reason to fire someone from the Amsterdam Fire Department. So he'd gotten rid of the boats, he'd fired a guy for racism-- progress. But The Brotherhood started a petition for the firefighter to get his job back.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:10:58.83" data-timestamp="658.83"> How did you feel about that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:11:01.42" data-timestamp="661.42"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:11:03.00" data-timestamp="663"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:11:03.91" data-timestamp="663.91"> It really opened my eyes. Instead of uniting around the people who were discriminated against, they united against the person who was discriminating, and they formed a block around him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:11:15.60" data-timestamp="675.6"> The problem ran so much deeper than Leen thought. Why wouldn't they want to stick up for the guy getting harassed? For Leen, it was obvious. He instinctively sided with the firefighter getting picked on, and he didn't understand anyone who didn't. That empathy for the outsider-- it made Leen an unusual commander. So he started investigating to figure out just how bad things were.</p><p begin="00:11:38.64" data-timestamp="698.64">The numbers were not encouraging. When Leen started, there were only five female firefighters on the entire full-time force of 500. The fire department is not allowed to record race, but he estimates that only around 10% of the force were people of color. These numbers didn't reflect the city at all. At least a third of Amsterdam's population is non-white.</p><p begin="00:11:59.58" data-timestamp="719.58">Leen visited the fire stations, and talked to firefighters over coffee at the long lunch tables there. And he learned that lots of them liked the changes he was bringing in. He had a silent band of support. He asked people about their experiences in the department, and to his surprise, people opened up to him. Through their stories, he started to get a sense of what it was like to be a person of color or a woman in his fire department.</p><p begin="00:12:22.95" data-timestamp="742.95">Moroccan and Surinamese-Dutch firefighters said they were called rats and monkeys. The Brotherhood told some they didn't belong-- that firefighters should be Dutch, and white. One Muslim firefighter I'm calling Ali told me that over time, he learned to go along with the racial slurs. So when his co-workers called him "bin Laden," he acted like he wasn't upset.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ali</h4><p begin="00:12:44.01" data-timestamp="764.01"> You have to ignore it. If they find out that you don't like it, they'll keep on coming back, and back, and back.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:12:51.25" data-timestamp="771.25"> Have you ever reported discrimination in the past?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ali</h4><p begin="00:12:55.14" data-timestamp="775.14"> It wasn't possible to do that. Nobody does that. You could report whatever you want, but nothing was going to happen. In the worst of cases, when it really got out of hand, what you would just do is shake hands on it and get it over. The one accused-- he'll just say, come on, man. It was a joke. And nothing's going to happen.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:13:13.05" data-timestamp="793.05"> Leen hired a consultant to help him reach out to women who'd quit the department. They felt like they never belonged. They said harassment and belittlement happened every hour of the day. One woman said men in her station asked her to leave the room so they could comment on her ass. Men told women to sit in the windows of the firehouse as if they were prostitutes in the red light district. During job interviews, women were asked how they do their jobs on their periods.</p><p begin="00:13:38.49" data-timestamp="818.49">One of the few female officers in the Amsterdam Fire Department is a woman I'm calling Judy. The guys respected her. She was strong, physically, and she was tough-- had no problem standing up to these guys. But even she felt like she was constantly being tested, like when a firefighter under her command purposely opened his towel in front of her. When she suggested that her boss has not put women into fire stations alone, but with other women, one of her superiors called her a "highly educated moaning female."</p><p begin="00:14:09.57" data-timestamp="849.57">One night, she was doing her rounds, checking in on everyone, and stopped by the canteen.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Judy</h4><p begin="00:14:15.01" data-timestamp="855.01"> I was saying good night to everybody. And then, they were sitting and watching porn.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:14:21.44" data-timestamp="861.44"> Didn't you say something then?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Judy</h4><p begin="00:14:23.64" data-timestamp="863.64"> No. So I didn't say anything about that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:14:28.35" data-timestamp="868.35"> Porn was a regular thing in the common areas of lots of the stations.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Judy</h4><p begin="00:14:32.46" data-timestamp="872.46"> I don't know why I didn't say anything. I didn't feel comfortable to say it, probably. It's also me being influenced by The Brotherhood, I think. Because saying something-- it's always uncomfortable to say that. So yeah, I have to admit that I've avoided it, too.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:14:54.12" data-timestamp="894.12"> Everyone's grip on what was normal was out of whack. Judy remembers a woman at a fire station who had this particular bedtime ritual.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Judy</h4><p begin="00:15:01.56" data-timestamp="901.56"> So she would go to bed, and somebody would come to tuck her in.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:15:05.94" data-timestamp="905.94"> Wait. They tucked her into bed at night?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:15:09.66" data-timestamp="909.66"> What exactly do you mean?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Judy</h4><p begin="00:15:10.56" data-timestamp="910.56"> Oh, tucking in-- it was like when you put your little one to sleep, and you pull your blankets tight around the person. So the guy who would do that said, I'm going to tuck her in. And I felt uncomfortable about that for her. I mean, it was her choice. But I would never do that, because it makes a certain situation that I think you should avoid.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:15:32.13" data-timestamp="932.13"> She was fine with it?

He wrote a manifesto on how to behave like a professional firefighter and sent it out to everyone. It begins, "All of us are going to act normal."</p><p begin="00:16:27.13" data-timestamp="987.13">"Normal" meant, we don't yell at each other. We don't steal coffee from the firehouses. We don't make offensive comments on social media. We always wear our uniforms. We don't store our personal tanning beds in the women's dormitories if we're men. If you break the rules, you'll be punished. And if you no longer know what "normal" is, please find out.</p><p begin="00:16:51.20" data-timestamp="1011.2">One of the biggest ways firefighting is not like a normal job-- firefighters work 24-hour shifts. So everyone lives together. They work out, shop for groceries, cook, watch TV, play soccer, sleep. Professional boundaries get blurry. Leen wanted to push the department to 8-hour shifts. It would make fire stations more like a workplace, and less like a private club.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:17:12.95" data-timestamp="1032.95"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:17:14.45" data-timestamp="1034.45"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:17:16.49" data-timestamp="1036.49"> I think the fire department-- many of the firefighters will fight almost literally to the death to defend this 24-hour shift.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:17:24.80" data-timestamp="1044.8"> Firefighters liked being together for 24 hours, and hanging out, and then getting a couple days off to spend with their families, or hold down second jobs.

The Brotherhood pressured firefighters not to transfer there.</p><p begin="00:17:54.86" data-timestamp="1074.86">The guys in The Brotherhood are afraid to talk to reporters.

It's a way of life.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:21:53.69" data-timestamp="1313.69"> Leen's approach to making big institutional change is based on a progressive fairly new management theory, designed to curb lawless organizations. It's essentially-- draw hard boundaries. Make no concessions. Be consistent, unrelenting. And in 10 to 15 years, maybe there'll be a real shift. It's arduous. The beginning is the hardest part.</p><p begin="00:22:15.99" data-timestamp="1335.99">This approach made a lot of sense to Leen because of his experience on the Amsterdam Police Force. He helped clean up and reform the department. As a rookie cop, he'd seen the problems firsthand. He started in a corrupt precinct, the red light district in the 1980s. He says cops stole, sold drugs, were excessively violent. Changing that meant rigorously enforcing rules, writing up bad cops, disciplining them, firing them. Leen says it took about 10 years for the rules to be accepted as normal. But this confrontational approach is not the way things usually work in the Netherlands.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:22:53.59" data-timestamp="1373.59"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:22:54.42" data-timestamp="1374.42"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:22:54.99" data-timestamp="1374.99"> You know, the Dutch culture is very much everything peace, everything together, no conflict.

They take pride in it. The idea is to bring everyone together, despite their differences, just like their ancestors came together to build dikes and dams to protect their land from the sea. Historians debate whether that's actually true. But anyway, everyone from Parliament to the local amateur soccer club tries to make decisions this way-- through discussions and consensus.</p><p begin="00:23:30.89" data-timestamp="1410.89">Leen did dabble with polder model a little in the beginning. He spent his first six months going to fire stations, trying to convince people that diversity would make them a stronger fire department in a city with almost 170 nationalities, and that women bring pragmatism and emotional intelligence to the brigade. But Leen was almost always met with blank stares. Guys told him, women aren't strong enough for this job. One of them said, you just want an excuse to bring in a hundred broads.

He had the full support of Mayor Eberhard van der Laan, who was wildly popular. The city adored him. He snubbed Vladimir Putin when he was in town because of the Russian leader's anti-LGBT views. The city council backed the mayor, and he backed Leen-- which meant, with the mayor's support, Leen could do whatever he wanted.

Immediately, the ground started to shift under Leen. When the mayor died, The Brotherhood grew emboldened. Here's Leen.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:33:27.99" data-timestamp="2007.99"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:33:28.94" data-timestamp="2008.94"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:33:32.24" data-timestamp="2012.24"> People commented that it was great that he died.

Retired firefighters and unions rallied around The Brotherhood, publicly demanding that the city investigate Leen for bad mouthing the fire department in the media. Firefighters did interviews anonymously, denouncing Leen in a conservative newspaper, the biggest paper in the Netherlands. From the moment the mayor announced he was sick, Leen started getting anonymous death threats. One letter said a hitman was being hired. Another targeted his 14-year-old daughter. He was told the threats were coming from inside the fire department.</p><p begin="00:34:36.46" data-timestamp="2076.46">In the summer of 2018, Amsterdam got an energetic new mayor, the first woman in the city's history-- Femke Halsema. She was Leen's new boss, and spent many years in parliament as a high-profile lawmaker representing the left-wing Green Party, a champion of women's rights. As a politician, she pushed for tax breaks to address poverty. She also wrote newspaper columns, and made a documentary about Muslim women.</p><p begin="00:35:02.01" data-timestamp="2102.01">Mayor Halsema condemned the death threats against Leen, and publicly threw her support behind him. But not long after she started, Leen remembers her stopping by for a private meeting. He told her about some of the changes he was trying to make. Her reaction shocked him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:35:16.45" data-timestamp="2116.45"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:35:17.60" data-timestamp="2117.6"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:35:18.54" data-timestamp="2118.54"> When we were having this conversation about racism and discrimination, the mayor herself came with the following example.

She said she's only told the joke in meetings as an example of, quote, "intolerable behavior that's not always recognized as such by firefighters." For Leen, that moment crystallized the world of difference between his old and new boss. After that, he gave up on her.</p><p begin="00:37:11.93" data-timestamp="2231.93">Mayor Halsema had, like the rest of Amsterdam, seen Leen's fight with the firefighters play out in the media, and she didn't like it. She liked talking up problems and reaching consensus-- the Dutch way. Fire department managers who sat in on meetings with the new mayor and Leen said it was clear right away that they didn't get along-- that sometimes, he was abrasive. Their styles were totally different. They called the mayor "Tai Chi," and Leen "Boxing."</p><p begin="00:37:38.78" data-timestamp="2258.78">The mayor ordered her own investigation into the fire department. The new investigation acknowledged there were problems, but it concluded that overall, the fire department was, quote, "at its core not a racist or sexist organization," and it called on Leen to take a different approach, and build trust with firefighters. A city hall reporter told me this report basically threw Leen under the bus. When it came out at the end of 2018, Leen had been on the job for about two and a half years. I spoke to him around this time. He seemed unfazed by the report. He was still going about the business of reforming the fire department, and airing its dirty laundry, like this problem firefighter.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:38:19.17" data-timestamp="2299.17"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:38:20.86" data-timestamp="2300.86"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:38:21.53" data-timestamp="2301.53"> He's not fired yet, but I'm going to fire him.

So we have time on the show today for just one more quick story about somebody deciding that the only way forward is to rip something down and rebuild from the ground up. Elna Baker, tell us what happened.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:51:00.58" data-timestamp="3060.58"> Here's a typical day from when Katie Dyer was 15, growing up outside Detroit. She gets home from school--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie Dyer</h4><p begin="00:51:06.85" data-timestamp="3066.85"> And our chore list was posted on the banister. And I was really frustrated, because it was longer than normal, and there were chickens from where the sliding glass door had been left open.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:51:20.17" data-timestamp="3080.17"> This happened all the time. Her mom loved chickens, and they got in the house. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a-- you know.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie Dyer</h4><p begin="00:51:27.97" data-timestamp="3087.97"> There were chickens perched on the couch. There were chickens on the kitchen counter, and on the dining room table. I mean, there were just chickens everywhere. And I looked up the stairs, and she was sitting at the computer. And I was just-- in that moment, I was very frustrated. Because now, I've got to herd the chickens outside, complete all these chores-- so I was just very irritated. And at some point, rather than going straight into my chores, I sat down to journal.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:52:04.24" data-timestamp="3124.24"> Will you read me what you wrote?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie Dyer</h4><p begin="00:52:06.30" data-timestamp="3126.3"> Yeah. So in this entry, it says, "My mom never does anything but sit at the computer and play the stupid Sims online anymore."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:52:16.43" data-timestamp="3136.43"> That's what her mom was doing when she came home from school-- playing <i>The</i> <i>Sims.</i> You know, the video game where you get a simulated family and a simulated house to live a simulated life.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie Dyer</h4><p begin="00:52:27.10" data-timestamp="3147.1"> Today, she made me do all the real chores after school because she was busy doing fake ones on <i>The</i> <i>Sims.</i> She brought home three fancy chickens today. Oh, great-- more fucking birds. OK. Gotta go. Bye.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:52:43.00" data-timestamp="3163"> Katie says her mom moved out of her bedroom and set up a futon in the computer room to sleep next to the game. She'd play, crash on the futon, play more. Katie craved her attention.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie Dyer</h4><p begin="00:52:54.34" data-timestamp="3174.34"> I remember, I used to just sometimes go up to her little den area, where her computer was set. And sometimes, doing things just to intentionally annoy her-- but in a funny way. Like, I would take her headphones off, and I would just come up to her, and sort of zerbert her neck-- like, raspberry her neck. Or, like-- what can I do to get your attention?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:53:19.27" data-timestamp="3199.27"> Katie began to feel invisible.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie Dyer</h4><p begin="00:53:21.40" data-timestamp="3201.4"> Like, I was just standing there, waving my arms over my head-- which is hilarious, because that's something the Sims would literally do. When they wanted your attention, they'd put their arms over their head, and wave them, and shout at you in whatever Sim language they speak.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:53:36.36" data-timestamp="3216.36"> Sometimes, Katie would catch glimpses of the world her mom was building. In <i>The</i> <i>Sims,</i> her mother played the guitar and piano, had dinner parties. She also had a Sims family named after her real husband and kids. Her sister and father looked like their Sims-- but not Katie. In real life, Katie dyed her hair and dressed edgy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie Dyer</h4><p begin="00:53:55.94" data-timestamp="3235.94"> But I remember-- the Sim that she had named after me had this stupid, almost bowl-cut-looking brown hair, and always wore these pencil skirts and button-ups. And I remember thinking, like, that's not me at all. Is that who you wish I was?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:54:18.48" data-timestamp="3258.48"> She tried everything she could think of to coax her mom off the Sims. She tried to reason with her, joke with her, bargain with her. Finally, Katie reached a breaking point. One night, she sat down at the computer and opened her mom's Sims world.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie Dyer</h4><p begin="00:54:34.01" data-timestamp="3274.01"> With her literally sleeping on the futon, just five feet away from me, was like-- well, I'm doing this. The first thing I did was-- so there was a cheat code. I think it's a semicolon and an exclamation point, over and over. You put it in, and you can get, like-- it was a lot of money. I got enough money that I could buy multiple stoves, mostly.</p><p begin="00:55:06.79" data-timestamp="3306.79">Another thing that I did, I remember, is you could buy-- I think it was like-- you know those oversized teddy bears people give? You could buy these giant oversized bears, and put them near the fireplace, and stuff like that. And so I removed the fire extinguishers, and the smoke detectors, and stuff. And I remember walking the Sim she had named after me out to the yard, and deleting the door behind me that went out to the front yard, and just waiting.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:55:45.95" data-timestamp="3345.95"> Her dad and sister Sim go to the stoves and start cooking. Soon, a kitchen and a living room fire break out. The sparks hit the teddy bears-- game on.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie Dyer</h4><p begin="00:55:55.28" data-timestamp="3355.28"> And the Sims are just running around, screaming with their hands in the air. And like--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:56:00.16" data-timestamp="3360.16"> And they really scream, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie Dyer</h4><p begin="00:56:01.79" data-timestamp="3361.79"> Yes. They scream in whatever that weird Sim language is.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:56:05.66" data-timestamp="3365.66"> Can you do it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie Dyer</h4><p begin="00:56:07.76" data-timestamp="3367.76"> [SCREAMING IN SIMLISH] It's just like that. It's just gibberish. And I'm laughing so hard. Like, I remember at some point thinking, I'm going to pee my pants. And I'm trying so hard to not laugh out loud, because she's sleeping right behind me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:56:24.13" data-timestamp="3384.13"> There were firemen, but they'd only come if you told your Sim to call them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie Dyer</h4><p begin="00:56:29.24" data-timestamp="3389.24"> I burned her Sim house and family alive.</p><p begin="00:56:34.13" data-timestamp="3394.13">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:56:36.63" data-timestamp="3396.63"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:56:43.13" data-timestamp="3403.13"> Eventually, the fire stops. The Katie character stands in the yard. Her mom, father, and sister are dead. When a Sim dies, this little urn appears in its place.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie Dyer</h4><p begin="00:56:53.93" data-timestamp="3413.93"> I went back in the house. And you could pick up the little urns. And I picked up the little urns, and just placed them near each other, and knew, well, I'm going to be in a lot of trouble tomorrow.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:57:08.72" data-timestamp="3428.72"> Because Katie was the only Sim left, it was going to be pretty clear who'd done all this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie Dyer</h4><p begin="00:57:14.01" data-timestamp="3434.01"> I got up the next morning to leave for school. And I remember, as I was leaving, she was just sort of starting to get logged into her game and stuff. When I got home, she yelled at me to come up the stairs. I came up the stairs, and she paused her Sim game that she had been rebuilding to turn around and yell at me. And she was like, you owe me an apology. That was weeks of my life. And it still felt like a small victory, I guess, because it was one of the first times in a while that she had to step away from that life to engage her real life.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:58:01.44" data-timestamp="3481.44"> She wrote in her journal, "Grounded. Figures. But it was funny. I have to do all the housework now so she can rebuild. I do all of it anyway, so whatever. Dad thinks I'll go to jail someday. At least in jail, they don't make you get up at 6:00 AM to feed chickens."</p><p begin="00:58:19.73" data-timestamp="3499.73">[FIRE NOISES AND SCREAMING]</p><p begin="00:58:22.18" data-timestamp="3502.18"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:58:30.53" data-timestamp="3510.53"> Elna Baker is one of the producers of our show.
