This was at a refugee camp in Greece. New lights had just been installed nearby, and they hijacked power from that buried cable to the tree.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Farhad</h4><p begin="00:00:26.03" data-timestamp="26.03">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:00:28.63" data-timestamp="28.63">Yeah, it comes over from [INAUDIBLE], and it's coming under the ground.

And somehow he just hooked it up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:40.77" data-timestamp="40.77">Before this, Farhad would wait sometimes for two or three hours to charge his phone at one of the chargers they have at the refugee camp. Now coming out of the ground right at the base of the tree was a cord with a socket on it, and then extension cords that allowed six phones to be charged-- incredible. Farhad breaks into English.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Farhad</h4><p begin="00:00:57.80" data-timestamp="57.8">I'm very happy today.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:00.34" data-timestamp="60.34">If you heard our radio show last week, you know that we went to refugee camps all over Greece. There are 57,000 refugees in Greece, most of them escaping violence in Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq hoping to get to Germany and other countries in Europe. But unless the politics change dramatically, they'll probably be stuck in Greece for a long time-- six months easily, maybe a lot more. The Greek government is building these camps to last for years, just in case.</p><p begin="00:01:24.72" data-timestamp="84.72">And the camps, people kind of know that. But mostly I think they don't like to admit it to themselves. So you see this weird mix of unrealistic hopes, and then people just starting to settle in for the long haul, moving ahead with their lives, falling in love, having babies, running little businesses, inventing projects. Today on our show we have stories of people trying to have semi-normal parts of their lives in a place that is not normal at all. From WBEZ Chicago, It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>. I'm Ira Glass. It's our second show from Greece, from the refugee camps there. Stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One: You Just Keep on Pushing My Love Over the Borderline</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:04.60" data-timestamp="124.6">Act one, You Just Keep On Pushing My Love Over the Borderline. It's hard for single guys at the camps. Camps are mostly families. In some camps, like the one at the baseball stadium in Athens, they segregate the single men together because the families don't like them around. They view them with suspicion.</p><p begin="00:02:21.01" data-timestamp="141.01">And of course Europe sees these guys the same way. People worry they're terrorists, troublemakers. Getting permission to get out of Greece and get into some other European country might be harder for them. And just at a practical level, lots of these guys are young, have never lived without their moms washing and cooking for them. A guy named Abdul said this thing to me off mic that he was embarrassed to repeat on tape, but my interpreter, Baraa, translated. He said--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:02:44.84" data-timestamp="164.84">Basically now we're like girls. Like we'll make our bed in the morning, and then, like, we clean dishes and we clean up the entire tent.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:51.22" data-timestamp="171.22">His tent was incredibly neat. You don't see single women traveling alone at these camps. They're almost always with their families, who are traditional and protective. But they're there, and there's flirting between men and women for sure, and sometimes more. One of our producers, Sean Cole, did meet a couple that got together as refugees at the camp in the north that was 2,000 people in tents at a highway rest stop, a gas station basically, called EKO. Here's Sean.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:03:17.80" data-timestamp="197.8">The main thing about the couple I met, Tarek and Hadil, is the PDA. They're always moon-eyed and handholdee. And the story of how they met super delighted my translator, Manaf.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Manaf</h4><p begin="00:03:30.07" data-timestamp="210.07">It's like a James Bond. [INAUDIBLE] James Bond.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:03:33.90" data-timestamp="213.9">They don't just remember the day they met, they remember the date, March 12. And it was right after they'd crossed over the water from Turkey and they were still living at the beach. Tarek was in the water going for a swim, and Hadil was up on the shore.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Manaf</h4><p begin="00:03:46.57" data-timestamp="226.57">He's coming out to the sea, hair wet. And she's charging her mobile phone.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:03:52.16" data-timestamp="232.16">It's like a soap commercial.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Manaf</h4><p begin="00:03:54.52" data-timestamp="234.52">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:03:58.42" data-timestamp="238.42">And their eyes met. Each of them would have noticed right away how deeply good looking the other is. Tarek is 25 and could play the lead in a Syrian production of <i>Jesus</i> <i>Christ</i> <i>Superstar</i>-- long hair, beard, hypnotic eyes. Hadil is 19 and, no joke, looks like the lady who played Mary in the movie <i>Jesus</i> <i>Christ</i> <i>Superstar</i>-- except when I met her, she was wearing a headscarf. It was love at first sight, for Tarek.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tarek</h4><p begin="00:04:24.36" data-timestamp="264.36">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:04:27.47" data-timestamp="267.47">So when I saw her, I said wow, you look beautiful. Can I speak to you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tarek</h4><p begin="00:04:33.37" data-timestamp="273.37">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:04:35.31" data-timestamp="275.31">And she refused a couple of times, but I didn't give up. I kept continuing.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:04:39.77" data-timestamp="279.77">How many times did you approach her?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tarek</h4><p begin="00:04:43.04" data-timestamp="283.04">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:04:46.24" data-timestamp="286.24">I tried for like 13, 14, or 15 times maybe--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:04:49.24" data-timestamp="289.24">Wow.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:04:49.54" data-timestamp="289.54">--just you know.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:04:50.98" data-timestamp="290.98">You're persistent.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tarek</h4><p begin="00:04:52.68" data-timestamp="292.68">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:04:56.10" data-timestamp="296.1">Yeah, her plan was to come from Mytiline to here. My plan was to go from Mytiline to a camp called Kavala. But I changed my plans to be here with her.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:05:07.93" data-timestamp="307.93">Tarek kept pursuing Hadil even as the crowd of refugees they were in was on the move, from the island to Athens, and from Athens north by train closer to the border. He did that thing you do on the bus on a school field trip, making people switch seats so he could be next to her. She still didn't want to talk to him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hadil</h4><p begin="00:05:24.66" data-timestamp="324.66">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:05:25.33" data-timestamp="325.33"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:05:26.84" data-timestamp="326.84">The situation is not appropriate, because obviously I'm a refugee, he's a refugee. As a refugee, I've never thought, never imagined that I would be ready to meet someone.</p><p begin="00:05:43.14" data-timestamp="343.14">I had plans of going to Germany, settle down, and then think of these hard matters. But seeing this young guy, it's like oh suddenly I fell in love with him and I want to be with him. And so I didn't care about the conditions.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:05:58.02" data-timestamp="358.02">And so what was it that changed your mind?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hadil</h4><p begin="00:06:00.61" data-timestamp="360.61">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:06:01.61" data-timestamp="361.61"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:06:03.34" data-timestamp="363.34">If he was someone who gave up, I wouldn't have pursued it. But I liked his persistence. That's what worked.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:06:14.46" data-timestamp="374.46">Manaf stops translating and turns to me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Manaf</h4><p begin="00:06:17.24" data-timestamp="377.24">That's a good tape.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:06:23.60" data-timestamp="383.6">And so, before you know it, Tarek and Hadil are planning a future together. But as with tens of thousands of other refugees in Greece, those plans involve gaining passage across multiple national borders, none of which show any promise of opening.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tarek</h4><p begin="00:06:37.46" data-timestamp="397.46">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:06:39.96" data-timestamp="399.96"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:06:40.96" data-timestamp="400.96">Basically we are in a bit of a tough situation.

It's not Hadil's parents are totally opposed to the relationship. It's just customary that they have to meet him first. But they aren't the only members of Hadil's family with opinions on this. In fact, she was traveling with family. She had them there with her at EKO Camp.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hadil</h4><p begin="00:07:18.90" data-timestamp="438.9">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:07:20.82" data-timestamp="440.82">My sister and my aunt.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:07:22.80" data-timestamp="442.8">Do they know about your relationship?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:07:24.44" data-timestamp="444.44">[SPEAKING ARABIC] Yes, they do.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:07:27.23" data-timestamp="447.23">Do they approve?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:07:27.99" data-timestamp="447.99">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:07:30.41" data-timestamp="450.41">They don't approve?

He's very affectionate and very romantic, which I love very much. But to them, they're saying to me hold on a second. There's nothing formal between the two of you. So to people, it might seem a bit out of order.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:08:29.71" data-timestamp="509.71">So they're worried it's going to look scandalous?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tarek</h4><p begin="00:08:32.32" data-timestamp="512.32">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:08:34.15" data-timestamp="514.15">Yes, exactly.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:08:36.18" data-timestamp="516.18">And finding privacy isn't exactly easy at a refugee camp, especially this camp, which is the size of a highway rest stop-- because again, it is a highway rest stop. Tarek says he went as far as to procure a secret tent for them, their own private tent that nobody knows about. I asked him, when shopping for a secret tent, what are the criteria you're looking for? Has to look like all the other tents, he said, so it doesn't stand out. That's smart.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tarek</h4><p begin="00:09:09.37" data-timestamp="549.37">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:09:10.82" data-timestamp="550.82"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:09:11.87" data-timestamp="551.87">I love her very much.

He's completely--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:11:31.31" data-timestamp="691.31">I learned the rest of the story later. It wasn't just that Tarek and Hadil were all huggy and kissy around the camp. Hadil and her family are Christian. Tarek's Muslim. Hadil had only started wearing a headscarf when Tarek asked her too, as a first step toward converting for him. And the family was not cool with this.</p><p begin="00:11:49.89" data-timestamp="709.89">Plus, this plan to get smuggled into Macedonia had already been underway for a while. And Hadil was suddenly saying, no, I'm staying behind with Tarek. And so they pried her out of there, beat Tarek up, bundled everybody into a bunch of cabs, and headed off to meet with a smuggler.</p><p begin="00:12:06.33" data-timestamp="726.33">Tarek, alarmingly, told the police. He reported them, to keep them from leaving, which he is totally unrepentant about, except he feels bad that the smuggler got arrested. The plan was foiled, so the family turned around and headed south to a different camp. And they were gone.</p><p begin="00:12:31.66" data-timestamp="751.66">And this is where I figured the story would end. Tarek didn't want to talk to me anymore. And then a couple of days later I was at a different camp interviewing some folks with Manaf, the translator, when Ammar, our fixer who had talked with Tarek, interrupted us.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:12:49.58" data-timestamp="769.58">Do you feel like the foreign media is trying to cover up the talents of refugees or-- say what?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ammar Saker</h4><p begin="00:12:55.38" data-timestamp="775.38">Just a second.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:12:55.80" data-timestamp="775.8">Oh, yeah-- yeah-- yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ammar Saker</h4><p begin="00:12:56.67" data-timestamp="776.67">I need to talk to you, and Manaf too, just for a second.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:13:01.65" data-timestamp="781.65">We walk a few feet away. It's about Tarek, Ammar says. My first thought is, oh no, he's tried to kill himself, which I know sounds dramatic. And that's not what happened. Ammar says Tarek has heard from Hadil. She and her family are planning to head back to Turkey the next day, and that he needs to get to her, to get her out of there. He needs a car he says. Ammar tells him, "I don't have a car. I'm a refugee like you."</p><p begin="00:13:27.24" data-timestamp="807.24">"Yes," says Tarek, "but you hang out with those journalists. Maybe they can help?"</p><p begin="00:13:31.89" data-timestamp="811.89">We had heard that driving refugees around could get you in trouble with the police. There was no way we were going to do that. But then I did do something that I'm not proud of, something that, if I had thought about it a little more, I would not have done. In the next moment I heard myself say, maybe I can get him some money for a taxi. Reporters aren't supposed to get involved like this in their stories. We're supposed to observe, not intervene.</p><p begin="00:13:58.63" data-timestamp="838.63">Looking back, it was a mistake. But in that moment, every reason I could think of not to help them seemed small, and almost cruel. I handed Ammar 100 euros. We all agreed he should tell Tarek it was from him and Manaf.</p><p begin="00:14:15.29" data-timestamp="855.29">I never saw Tarek. Apparently he was so happy he did a little dance. He picked up Hadil at a cafeteria near where her family was staying and brought her with him back up north to a camp near the Macedonian border. After that, I wasn't worried about ethics. I was worried about Tarek and Hadil. What if Hadil's family found them and beat Tarek up again? At the very least, they'd have to be worried sick not knowing where Hadil is. Also, I don't even know these people. I don't know if this is what's best for them, for her.</p><p begin="00:14:46.70" data-timestamp="886.7">But I've talked with Tarek and Hadil on the phone since then, and they both said things are as good as they could possibly be right now. For one thing, they're married. They had a Muslim wedding and a Christian wedding. And Tarek says he even got some money together to pay a lawyer to help them get the marriage sanctioned in Greece.</p><p begin="00:15:04.78" data-timestamp="904.78">Hadil's aunt and uncle and sister never did go to Turkey. According to Tarek, they actually managed to get farther north in Europe, illegally. It's not that they're OK with the relationship, but now that it's official, they feel like they have to go along with it. Hadil's parents, though, are totally on board with it now.</p><p begin="00:15:23.33" data-timestamp="923.33">Mostly when we hear about luck in the refugee camps, it's bad luck. But of course with so many people, something has to go right for somebody. It's just the law of averages. And Tarek and Hadil beat the odds in a ridiculous way. Even just meeting each other was a slim possibility, let alone his convincing her to give him a chance and convincing a bunch of near strangers to kick him 100 euros so he could get her back.</p><p begin="00:15:48.34" data-timestamp="948.34">A few weeks after all this, my fixer Ammar was texting with Tarek. And Tarek said, "The most ridiculous thing of all is that all these feelings of love that you have in your heart, the big sacrifices you have made and the unexpected problems, all come down to a taxi fare. It's a bastard of a feeling when you're racing against time and it's not on your side."</p></div>  </div>

Act two, Thank You for Smoking.</p><p begin="00:16:25.79" data-timestamp="985.79">People don't have a lot of money in the refugee camps. To explain people's financial situation, Joanna Kakissis, NPR's reporter in Greece who's producing these two episodes on the refugee camps with us, she explained to me that these refugees from Syria and the Mideast that we've all seen arriving on boats in Greece, she explained that they came in several distinct waves. The first wave--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:16:47.14" data-timestamp="1007.14">So in early 2014 when I first started following the story, everyone I met was fairly well off. I mean--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:16:54.76" data-timestamp="1014.76">All the refugees coming through.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:16:56.05" data-timestamp="1016.05">Right. And they had paid something like between 3,000 and 5,000 euros to buy fake passports or fake IDs and fly to Germany or Sweden or wherever they were headed.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:11.46" data-timestamp="1031.46">5,000 euros is about $5,500 American.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:17:14.56" data-timestamp="1034.56">And so we're talking about people who are cardiologists, people who are geophysicists, people who are big corporate managers.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:21.56" data-timestamp="1041.56">Then the second wave arrived. This is last year, 2015. And it arrived because another route from Greece into the rest of Europe opened up, what they called the Balkan route. You didn't have to pay for a smuggler. You could just walk north out of Greece using maps that people were sharing on WhatsApp. Or much easier, you could take a bus.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:17:39.86" data-timestamp="1059.86">So this route was actually much, much cheaper. You know, it was just a matter of buying bus tickets from one place to the other. And that's why you saw so many people coming, because suddenly it was less expensive.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:51.43" data-timestamp="1071.43">And so what kind of people were you seeing then?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:17:53.17" data-timestamp="1073.17">Then that's when you started seeing schoolteachers, shop owners, barbers. I mean, like the best way to put it is that people with just not that much money.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:18:02.45" data-timestamp="1082.45">And so these were the people, when the border to the rest of Europe closed this March, these were the people who got stuck in these refugee camps. Most of them are middle class and working class families who carry the equivalent of $1,000 or $2,000, and definitely did not have enough to spring for $3,000 to $5,000 per person for a smuggler and a fake passport.</p><p begin="00:18:21.65" data-timestamp="1101.65">So, they arrived without much money, and now it's been nearly five months. So to survive, lots of people get money from family overseas, wired to them, Western Union, to spend on essentials. And you can see what that means at our next stop. This is a camp that's been built on the grounds of an abandoned psychiatric hospital. It's kind of a spectacular setting at the base of Mount Olympus. So you have this snow capped mountain looming, surrounded by thick forest. Yellow paint is peeling off the old hospital buildings on the grounds-- 1,300 people living in white military tents, the Yazidi, which is a religious minority from Iraq.</p><p begin="00:18:58.68" data-timestamp="1138.68">And unlike the other camps that we visited, the people here are looking for a country that's going to take all 1,300 of them. They don't want to be split up. Before the borders closed, they'd been trying to join other Yazidis who'd already made it to Germany. One of our producers, Miki Meek, visited.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:19:12.64" data-timestamp="1152.64">This camp is in the middle of nowhere. The closest town is about 16 miles away. Very soon after the Yazidis arrived, people began setting up their own town in the camp, slipping right back into their old jobs.</p><p begin="00:19:25.15" data-timestamp="1165.15">A group of men who used to be barbers back in Iraq lined up chairs by an electrical outlet outside. Haircuts go for 2 euros. Eyebrow and beard threadings go for 1.</p><p begin="00:19:35.22" data-timestamp="1175.22">Three women on the other side of the camp made an oven out of a metal barrel they covered with mud. They're bakers. You can buy five pieces of naan for  1 euro.</p><p begin="00:19:44.64" data-timestamp="1184.64">But the most popular spot is in a makeshift shop along a dirt path at the front of the camp. A guy named Ahmad built it. He threw it together with UNHCR tarps and old doors and shutters he found in the abandoned psychiatric hospital. He made an awning out of a thick green sleeping bag from the military. Ahmad pointed out the most popular item in his shop.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ahmad</h4><p begin="00:20:04.01" data-timestamp="1204.01">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:20:08.64" data-timestamp="1208.64">The most selling item obviously is cigarettes.

Sometimes I'd look over at my interpreter Manaf during an interview, and he'd be holding a lit cigarette in each hand. It was too rude to say no.</p><p begin="00:21:15.03" data-timestamp="1275.03">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:21:15.86" data-timestamp="1275.86">Lighter.

Then I learned he's hardly making any profit. I'm pretty sure he's running the world's only cigarette charity.</p><p begin="00:21:38.12" data-timestamp="1298.12">Ahmad pays to take a bus down to town a couple times a week where he loads up on cigarettes. Total cost per pack, including his bus fare, 2.35 euros a pack. And then at the camp, he turns them around and sells them for only 2.50 euros. That's just a 15 cent profit, barely covers his costs.</p><p begin="00:21:57.69" data-timestamp="1317.69">He gives good deals for fruits and vegetables too. They get three meals a day from the Greek government, but they're like TV dinners, nothing fresh. So people stop by right after meals are distributed--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ahmad</h4><p begin="00:22:08.98" data-timestamp="1328.98">Tomato-- tomato.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:22:11.10" data-timestamp="1331.1">--to make up things like eggplants, cucumbers, bananas.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ahmad</h4><p begin="00:22:14.58" data-timestamp="1334.58">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:22:16.08" data-timestamp="1336.08">This bag of sugar as well, 89 cents.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:22:19.44" data-timestamp="1339.44">Ahmed said he sells sugar for what it costs, because it's too much of a necessity.

They just tell him later.</p><p begin="00:23:08.61" data-timestamp="1388.61">Everyone is low on cash, even the most powerful person in the camp, the religious leader, Sheikh Nuri. Even he has to get stuff for free from Ahmad. I watched him stop by the shop after lunch.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sheikh Nuri</h4><p begin="00:23:20.55" data-timestamp="1400.55">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:23:21.48" data-timestamp="1401.48"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:23:25.44" data-timestamp="1405.44">I took some spices, onions, and tomato for free. So basically the way it goes, if I need something, I would come to the shop and take it. We're all like this. We're barely surviving. Most of us will have to borrow from Ahmad. Ahmad is ready-- Ahmad is ready to help us. Without him, I think we don't know what we would do basically.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:23:56.97" data-timestamp="1436.97">This camp is different from the others we visited. The Islamic State targeted these Yazidis for extinction, invaded their home in the mountains of northern Iraq, and began a mass extermination campaign, killed the men, kidnapped the women and girls, and made them sex slaves, sent the kids to ISIS training camps. Maybe you remember, these are the people President Obama helped save with airstrikes in 2014. They're survivors fleeing genocide. They're used to looking out for each other.</p><p begin="00:24:24.95" data-timestamp="1464.95">Ahmad said it's ingrained in them. So when people come to his shop and they can't pay, he's fine with that. He tells them to pay what they can when they can if they can. He carries a little black notebook in his fanny pack, listing each family and what they owe him.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:24:40.86" data-timestamp="1480.86">What does it say?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ahmad</h4><p begin="00:24:42.13" data-timestamp="1482.13">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:24:43.86" data-timestamp="1483.86">Name, Hadeato. 2 euros previously owed, plus 4 euros today for vegetables.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ahmad</h4><p begin="00:24:51.50" data-timestamp="1491.5">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:24:52.98" data-timestamp="1492.98">Marwan, another name, 13 euros owed in the past. 3 euros tomato, 2 euros onion.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:25:02.87" data-timestamp="1502.87">So aren't you're just losing a lot of money?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ahmad</h4><p begin="00:25:05.45" data-timestamp="1505.45">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:25:07.25" data-timestamp="1507.25"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:25:10.16" data-timestamp="1510.16">I started the shop with 500 euros as a capital.

Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's it's our second show from the refugee camps in Greece. This week, you don't have to live like a refugee. We have stories of people trying to get on with their lives even though they are stuck in a refugee camp.</p><p begin="00:28:49.84" data-timestamp="1729.84">And before we go any further with our show, I just want to say an incredible team has built an interactive tour of the camps that we visited with little movies and photos and three dimensional architectural renderings. And it pains me, as a radio producer, to say the following words, to admit that seeing something might actually give you a fuller view of it, but it's true. They did a great job capturing all kinds of things about daily life that you can't actually see over the radio. It's at our website thisamericanlife.org. And this brings us to Act Three of our program, Act Three, Last Resort.</p><p begin="00:29:24.08" data-timestamp="1764.08">So as we talked about a little bit in last week's program, the Greek government's response to the refugee crisis has had a lot of heart. The refugees are treated with respect. They're treated with warmth in many places that we visited. But it hasn't gone so smoothly.</p><p begin="00:29:37.78" data-timestamp="1777.78">Two government agencies have had trouble sorting out who would do what. It's still disorganized. Housing conditions for the refugees nearly everywhere are substandard. One official from an international organization that is working with the Greek government told me at one point, "It's 57,000 refugees." And they said, "Compare that to the refugee situations that they deal with elsewhere." Jordan has 700,000 refugees. Lebanon has over a million. Turkey has over 2 million. "57,000 refugees, this person said, "that's a soccer game in Europe. It shouldn't be this hard."</p><p begin="00:30:08.40" data-timestamp="1808.4">So there is a camp trying to set the gold standard for what refugee camps can be in Greece. It's near a village called Myrsini on the coast of the Ionian Sea, a four hour drive west of Athens. LM Village it's called. It's a former resort, an actual beach vacation resort that went bankrupt seven years ago-- 38 bungalows, painted bright orange and yellow, each with its own bathroom and electricity and kitchenette, a little plot of grass all facing the sea with a secluded beach just for them. One of our producers said when she saw it the first time, "With a little TLC and some water in the pool, we'd all want to stay there."</p><p begin="00:30:42.69" data-timestamp="1842.69">So this March right after the borders closed, this beach resort refugee camp opened basically because one person, the mayor of that area, willed it into existence. Joanna went there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:30:54.46" data-timestamp="1854.46">This mayor is different from other Greek mayors in one important way. This mayor's from Syria. His name's Nabil Morad. He actually made history a couple of years ago when he became the first immigrant elected mayor in Greece. And back then Nabil was focused on the typical things that mayors think about-- you know, fixing roads and street lights, marketing the region's strawberries, improving tourism.</p><p begin="00:31:18.55" data-timestamp="1878.55">But as the refugee crisis unfolded in Europe and he saw so many Syrians displaced and homeless, it really got to him. He took one look at the empty beach resort in his municipality, LM Village, and he thought, why not? Why not bring them here to this beach resort?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nabil Morad</h4><p begin="00:31:34.80" data-timestamp="1894.8">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p><p begin="00:31:36.65" data-timestamp="1896.65"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:31:38.35" data-timestamp="1898.35">You need to provide shelter in an elegant way, in a good way.

They need to be treated with respect and with care. That's why the success of this camp is so important to me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:31:58.54" data-timestamp="1918.54">Nabil is the Greekest Syrian I've ever met. He moved here 27 years ago, married a Greek, served in the Greek army, works as a doctor, and runs a clinic with his Greek doctor wife, in Greece. He's so fluent in Greek he often speaks in old world slang my grandmother used to use.</p><p begin="00:32:16.06" data-timestamp="1936.06">Nabil knew he was the best advocate for a better lifestyle for refugees. To rally locals around his cause, Nabil, in a kind of Mr. Smith Goes to the Ionian Sea way, held a town meeting in Maria Palaiologos cafe in Myrsini. That's how small a town this is, the cafe doesn't even have a name. It's just Maria Palaiologos cafe. At least 100 people packed inside, and more spilled out onto the street.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nabil Morad</h4><p begin="00:32:41.19" data-timestamp="1961.19">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p><p begin="00:32:43.80" data-timestamp="1963.8"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:32:46.63" data-timestamp="1966.63">Some of them had created an atmosphere of fear and terror about the refugees, that they're criminal, heathens, lazy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nabil Morad</h4><p begin="00:32:55.13" data-timestamp="1975.13">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p><p begin="00:32:56.40" data-timestamp="1976.4"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:32:59.28" data-timestamp="1979.28">An old man told me about he was a buy a shotgun to keep them from getting into his home. Others were talking about rapes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:33:07.17" data-timestamp="1987.17">Nabil told them he wanted to bring only families, Syrian families, people like him-- no single men, no Afghans, no Pakistanis, just Syrian families. He knew his audience. He also told the group it wouldn't cost the municipality anything to host the Syrian families. The state would cover everything but trash collection.</p><p begin="00:33:27.52" data-timestamp="2007.52">A week after the meeting at the cafe, he called on his municipal council to vote on the plan. It really went over. Out of 26 council members, only one voted no.</p><p begin="00:33:49.15" data-timestamp="2029.15">Here's how desperate the Greek government is to get people set up in camps. It took them less than a week. In fact, just four days after the vote, buses filled with Syrians, over 300, arrived at the abandoned beach resort. Nabil and his family were there, some local councilors too. Remember, Nabil had promised that only families would come live at the resort. Nabil hoped that was true.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nabil Morad</h4><p begin="00:34:14.12" data-timestamp="2054.12">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p><p begin="00:34:15.26" data-timestamp="2055.26"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:34:17.16" data-timestamp="2057.16">Well, we were very nervous because we didn't know who got in. Since things were done in a hurry, I didn't know what to expect. Who will I find on the buses?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nabil Morad</h4><p begin="00:34:28.41" data-timestamp="2068.41">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:34:30.90" data-timestamp="2070.9">The whole village had gathered. There was some that came out of love. And there was a group against my decision for the center, waiting to see so they could protest more. They wanted to reaffirm their lies using the first image of the refugees. They always say the same.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alexandra Altouni</h4><p begin="00:34:46.02" data-timestamp="2086.02">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:34:49.69" data-timestamp="2089.69">If they are men, they will steal, kill, and rape. When they saw, just as I did, the children that were coming out of the buses first, at this point I relaxed. The crowd started hugging the children. Some of them started smiling.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:35:06.73" data-timestamp="2106.73">Nabil remembers meeting a baby who was just five days old.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nabil Morad</h4><p begin="00:35:11.08" data-timestamp="2111.08">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:35:12.54" data-timestamp="2112.54">She was in a little basket.

My knees were shaking from holding her.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:35:35.06" data-timestamp="2135.06">[SPEAKING ARABIC] You were moved I said.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nabil Morad</h4><p begin="00:35:37.10" data-timestamp="2137.1">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:35:38.17" data-timestamp="2138.17">Very, very.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nabil Morad</h4><p begin="00:35:40.23" data-timestamp="2140.23">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p><p begin="00:35:41.62" data-timestamp="2141.62"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:35:42.93" data-timestamp="2142.93">I understood her mother who gave birth alone in a hospital and didn't even know the language, with no one of her people there to wish well for the child in Arabic.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nabil Morad</h4><p begin="00:35:51.52" data-timestamp="2151.52">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:35:53.33" data-timestamp="2153.33">That's why I was so moved.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:35:59.73" data-timestamp="2159.73">This camp is meant to be better than other camps, and it is. There are kids on BMX bikes. There are soccer and basketball games. There's a trampoline and ping pong. Men play chess on a lawn with a view of the sea. The beach is to the west, so there's a sunset on the water every day.</p><p begin="00:36:18.41" data-timestamp="2178.41">Sometimes a group of friends, women, dress up in beautiful printed velour dresses that cover them from head to toe, just to go for a walk on the paved empty road lined with ornate old fashioned lampposts.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Refugee</h4><p begin="00:36:30.54" data-timestamp="2190.54">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:36:33.51" data-timestamp="2193.51">The Syrians told me that after finally making it to Greece and sleeping in tents, pitched on streets, in field, in the mud, they were relieved to get here and rest on beds and actual homes with their own bathrooms. One woman told me she hadn't had a full night's sleep in months until she got here.</p><p begin="00:36:54.00" data-timestamp="2214">The camp has been open now for four months. And Nabil never expected how demanding it would be. He's the one who recruited volunteers, organized doctors and midwives, called in immigration lawyers, got supplies donated. And then when the refugees arrived, he realized a critical oversight. He brought hundreds of people who only speak Arabic to a rural area where the only other person for miles who also spoke Arabic was him, Nabil, which meant that he's the person who explains that the food is not rotten or where to buy Halal meat or which direction Mecca is.</p><p begin="00:37:29.47" data-timestamp="2249.47">The Syrians ask him to help them get papers to go to Germany. They ask him if EU leaders are going to fly them out of the local airport. Sometimes when someone needs to get to Athens for asylum interviews and doesn't have a ride, he'll buy the bus ticket himself. He gets calls from the camp all the time, day or night. The Syrians ask him everything, including-- because remember, Nabil is not only the mayor, he's also a doctor-- they ask him lots of questions about their health.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nabil Morad</h4><p begin="00:37:58.14" data-timestamp="2278.14">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:38:00.54" data-timestamp="2280.54"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:38:02.33" data-timestamp="2282.33">Like here he is walking around the camp just saying hello to two women. One of them says her friend is very tired. The friend says her body and throat hurt. Nabil checks her throat.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nabil Morad</h4><p begin="00:38:11.07" data-timestamp="2291.07">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:38:13.81" data-timestamp="2293.81"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:38:15.84" data-timestamp="2295.84">You need antibiotics, he says, and sends her to the camp medical station. This is all on top of him having to run his clinic full time. And being mayor is a big job. He manages 22 towns in his municipality. He calls this camp, LM Village, his 23rd town.</p><p begin="00:38:34.33" data-timestamp="2314.33">I live in Greece, and I can tell you that the refugee crisis has created a whole new sense of obligation. Whenever I interview Greeks about the refugees or when I talk to my relatives and friends and neighbors, one thing always comes across. People want to help them. There's a word in Greek, [GREEK]. There's no equivalent in English. But in essence it means be generous and do good. It's a point of national pride, of Greek character and culture.</p><p begin="00:39:04.01" data-timestamp="2344.01">But after a six year economic crisis so many Greeks are broke or barely getting by, Greeks are also thinking it's a very real possibility that I could soon be destitute myself. And how can I help then? How can we help so many displaced people now living with us?</p><p begin="00:39:20.56" data-timestamp="2360.56">And you see both these impulses, [GREEK] and fear, in Myrsini, the town next to LM Village. On the one hand, the locals I spoke with said most people don't have a problem with the Syrians. They're happy that these families with little kids are secure and safe. The vice president of the town, for example, told me he spends all day with the Syrians and he sees real needs there.</p><p begin="00:39:42.28" data-timestamp="2382.28">But he also sees needs all around him, even his own neighbor, a 70-year-old woman he's known his whole life. She's now so broke she's washing her hair with Tide. Or there's Nikos who's 43, and like a quarter of Greeks, unemployed. He used to work in construction. When I'd met him, he'd been out of work for a while and he didn't have health insurance. And he expressed real and understandable resentment.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nikos</h4><p begin="00:40:05.96" data-timestamp="2405.96">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p><p begin="00:40:07.11" data-timestamp="2407.11"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:40:08.92" data-timestamp="2408.92">I don't have the money to pay.

Sometimes I've noticed that local resentment toward the camp is less personal and more outright xenophobic.</p><p begin="00:40:34.04" data-timestamp="2434.04">Occasionally the rumors get really overblown. My producer Robyn Semien and I spoke to Alexandra Altouni. She's the councilwoman who voted against the camp in the first place.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alexandra Altouni</h4><p begin="00:40:44.62" data-timestamp="2444.62">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:40:49.59" data-timestamp="2449.59">I heard of what they say is, well, you know.

There is also a small but very vocal minority that's frustrated and angry and blaming Nabil.</p><p begin="00:42:55.44" data-timestamp="2575.44">To give you a sense of how intense this can be, the first week in June, I stopped by the camp late one Sunday night with my interpreter, Roula.

Every incremental, mind numbingly boring change is discussed.</p><p begin="01:01:25.15" data-timestamp="3685.15">Nasem's in this super dangerous pregnancy, and when she finally got to see a doctor who specializes in high risk pregnancies and was in his care for a whole week, he said she asked him next to nothing. And he explained things using Google Translate on his phone hoping it made sense. It seemed tragic.</p><p begin="01:01:45.33" data-timestamp="3705.33">After I told him she was, in fact, open to the idea of an abortion, I asked the question again.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="01:01:52.30" data-timestamp="3712.3">Do you think if you knew that she was open to the idea, even though she doesn't want one, do you think you might have asked her to consider maybe having one?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charalampos Vitsas</h4><p begin="01:02:06.61" data-timestamp="3726.61">Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="01:02:08.85" data-timestamp="3728.85">You do?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charalampos Vitsas</h4><p begin="01:02:10.78" data-timestamp="3730.78">Yeah, because the condition is very high risk.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="01:02:16.38" data-timestamp="3736.38">Huh.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="01:02:19.62" data-timestamp="3739.62">Just to be clear, I'm not saying Nasem should have an abortion.

It's a guess.</p><p begin="01:02:43.41" data-timestamp="3763.41">Maybe the biggest problem with having a pregnancy like this, in a refugee camp, is no one person is tracking Nasem as she goes. I'm sure that's a problem with other urgent medical issues, but a pregnancy like Nasem's, she needs someone who will take this on, who will be with her for the whole nine months. She doesn't have that. As of August, she's six months pregnant, still at the camp, and still piecing it together without understanding most of what's being said to her, one worrying hospital visit to the next.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="01:03:23.22" data-timestamp="3803.22">Robyn Semien.</p><p begin="01:03:27.04" data-timestamp="3807.04"></p><p begin="01:03:27.52" data-timestamp="3807.52"></p><p begin="01:03:28.00" data-timestamp="3808"></p><p begin="01:03:28.48" data-timestamp="3808.48"></p><p begin="01:03:28.96" data-timestamp="3808.96"></p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act Five: Smile, You’re on Handmade Camera</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="01:03:29.92" data-timestamp="3809.92">Act Five, Smile, You're On Handmade Camera. So when we were preparing to go to Greece, one of our producers, Sean Cole, was researching probably the best known refugee camp. It was at Idomeni. Right on the Macedonian border in the north. And it was like on the border. And it was vast, 15,000 people living there at its height, and not an official camp set up by the government. It was kind of a mess-- mud and people and protests and clashes with police and refugees throwing rocks and police firing tear gas. If you saw any pictures in the news of Greek refugee camps, chances are you were looking at Idomeni.</p><p begin="01:04:00.90" data-timestamp="3840.9">But researching Idomeni, we hit upon this one piece of coverage that we found that was not like any of the others. And Sean got a little bit obsessed with it. Here he is.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="01:04:11.16" data-timestamp="3851.16">Before we left for Greece, I had heard that a group of refugees at Idomeni were doing video news bulletins from the camp themselves, which was intriguing. They called it refugees.tv. But then when I went to watch the videos online--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Refugees.tv</h4><p begin="01:04:24.79" data-timestamp="3864.79">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="01:04:26.45" data-timestamp="3866.45">I'll just describe them.

And also in the shot with him-- I mean obviously somebody is actually recording him. But within the shot is another guy who's just acting like he's the camera man, with a camera that is a block of wood with a plastic bottle tied to it. And with fake mic and camera in hand, they walk up to one person after another and say, in reporterly seriousness, "May I ask a few questions?"</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mahmoud Abdul Rahim</h4><p begin="01:05:03.15" data-timestamp="3903.15">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="01:05:05.12" data-timestamp="3905.12">Some people smile a little first.

Basel, squinting into a piece of wood, is shorter and chubby, and says almost nothing in the videos.

He and Basel walk over to an unsuspecting interview subject, but you can barely hear them because, again, they're speaking into a piece of garbage.</p><p begin="01:09:12.49" data-timestamp="4152.49">It makes sense that these guys, and actually a lot of the refugees that we talked to, would have a problem with the media. You hear people say, we're living like animals here. Add to that a bunch of random camera crews and reporters roaming around, and they feel like animals in a zoo. Plus someone else is deciding what their story is and what it means. That must suck. So taking out the fake camera and mocking the news media was an antidote to that, for everybody.

But this time a group of fake UN officials are stationed behind him, five men standing near a tiny square table with paper placards strung around their necks that say UN written in pen. A white board hung off to the side reads, UN Office of No Information and No Help For Refugees.</p><p begin="01:10:55.04" data-timestamp="4255.04">One of the five fake officials is Mustafa. Mahmoud approaches him, saying, "How can you help the refugees here that have been stuck for over 55 days-- 55 days-- and don't know what's going to happen to them? And the UN and the European Union haven't decided anything. They're saying there's a surprise today at the UN office.

That's not even the main focus. They just want to tell their own story instead of ceding that to someone else. And the name of the project not withstanding, in a way, they're sticking their hand in the air and saying, we're not Refugees with a capital R. We're people who were going somewhere until something stopped us.</p><p begin="01:12:27.23" data-timestamp="4347.23">Individually, the videos have a kind of diaristic randomness to them.

One day early last May, a guy named Abu Muhammad was beaten up while waiting in line for food. That happened a lot at Idomeni. Fights would break out in the food lines.</p><p begin="01:13:12.23" data-timestamp="4392.23">Because of the fight, Abu Muhammad hadn't eaten. His kids hadn't eaten. And he just snapped and decided to hang himself. He got as far as rigging up this rickety gallows by the train tracks before a whole crowd of people stopped him and tried to calm him down, at which point he just became a ball of desperation.
