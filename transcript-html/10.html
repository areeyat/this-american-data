  <h3>Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:01.50" data-timestamp="1.5">There's what we wish for and there's what we get. For Susan Bergman, the story went like this. Her father led a double life. On the one hand, he proudly described himself as a family man, a church organist, in a denomination that was so strict the women covered their heads, wore no make-up, no dancing, no smoking, no drinking, no going to theaters, no swimming with members of the opposite sex, even. Her father stage-managed things so they appeared to be the perfect blond-haired, blue-eyed, American family. But secretly, he was having sex with men. By all accounts, it was lots of men. Sometimes he would even fly off to New York, go to gay clubs there.</p><p begin="00:01:02.36" data-timestamp="62.36">In 1983, he was one of the first victims of AIDS. They had barely named the disease. The symptoms weren't familiar. And he died before his children got the chance to ask him about who he really was and talk to him about how they should reconcile who he had pretended to be all those years, with who he was. What was real of their childhood?</p><p begin="00:01:41.08" data-timestamp="101.08">Susan Bergman wrote a book about her family's experience. And on her book tour, a very particular thing started to happen. Gay men, who were still married or who had been married, started to contact her. They wanted to explain her father's double life to her. They wanted to explain their own double lives to her. And they wanted to offer her the conversation that she never got to have with her father.</p><p begin="00:02:18.81" data-timestamp="138.81">Well, from WBEZ in Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Back once again for another hour documenting life in these United States. Today's program in four acts. Act One, gay men. I talk to Susan Bergman about her father. Act Two, a gay man talks to me in a parked car in an undisclosed location about why he thinks that his children don't need to know that he's gay and why he stays married. Act Three, we take all the heavy, very heavy themes about lying and families from the first two acts and rework them as comedy, if you can believe that. And finally, Act Four, the sins of the fathers pass on to the sons. Stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One: The Book Tour</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:30.65" data-timestamp="210.65">Act One, The Book Tour. Susan Bergman came to our studios, loaded down with evidence.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:38.96" data-timestamp="218.96">OK, now you've brought in some tapes of yourself being interviewed on talk radio shows that I've got here. So this first one, do we need to explain it at all before we play it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Bergman</h4><p begin="00:03:52.64" data-timestamp="232.64">I think this was a caller that was, in some ways, typical of the response that I got on talk radio.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:01.33" data-timestamp="241.33">Here we go.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:04:02.75" data-timestamp="242.75">I have a particularly close connection to this sort of thing. I'm a gay father, divorced now. So I'm very close to this. In particular, I can understand your father's secretiveness and his pain. There's always the resentment that you had to go through the pain, that you had to hide, that you had to lie. And you live with that resentment. It really never quite goes away, even in my case, after you've come completely out and divorced and the whole bit. And the resentment lives on, that I had to do live that lie, that I had to lie to my wife, that I had to lie to my children, that I had to life to my family. And never be happy. Never, never, never know happiness.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:53.85" data-timestamp="293.85">Hey, Susan?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Bergman</h4><p begin="00:04:54.62" data-timestamp="294.62">Uh-huh.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:55.47" data-timestamp="295.47">Can I just ask you, what was your reaction to-- when he was saying this, had it occurred to you before that your father would actually be resentful of the family for the secret that he was keeping from you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Bergman</h4><p begin="00:05:10.56" data-timestamp="310.56">He was angry at us a lot. But it seemed like it was more-- I mean I interpreted that as we were bothering Dad, or Mom was asking too many questions. Yeah. It's not one that had occurred to me. And I would have to contest that assumption that one has to lie or one is put in a situation where lying is the only appropriate gesture or response.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:42.71" data-timestamp="342.71">Let's go back to this tape.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:05:44.23" data-timestamp="344.23">And I hope that-- I don't know. Is there anything that I can help you. Any questions that I could answer. Because I'm still alive and I've been through it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Bergman</h4><p begin="00:05:54.50" data-timestamp="354.5">That's great. Boy, I hope I can do this without just kind of gushing all over you, because it's so great of you to call in and offer that. It's beautiful. I didn't get that chance with my father. I guess I would ask you--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:09.55" data-timestamp="369.55">I'm just stopping the tape here. I'm just going to stop the tape here, because as you're listening, you're making the gagging signal at your own reaction.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Bergman</h4><p begin="00:06:18.61" data-timestamp="378.61">Oh, I think that's so great. Oh, I think that's so wonderful. I was not in touch with the full range of the reaction until after I hung up the telephone and stopped the radio interview. And clearly, that man was hurting in a lot of ways. And the last thing I needed to do was have a fight with him on the air about being a liar, or whatever. Whatever anger I would have had towards my father didn't seem to me to apply to him. He was just some innocent bystander. So I just tried to be nice. And it was kind-- oh yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:04.99" data-timestamp="424.99">There's the thing that you wish for and there's the thing that you get. And if what you really need is a long talk with your father, the kind of talk where you get mad and argue, and maybe he gets mad, and maybe people admit mistakes, and maybe things get resolved or maybe they don't get resolved, and you learn that they won't get resolved. But if that conversation is what you need, then no stranger on a radio call-in show, however well meaning, is going to give that to you. It's a mockery of what you need.</p><p begin="00:07:57.03" data-timestamp="477.03">But there you are. There you are. You're talking to this man, this stranger. And you find yourself asking a version of the question that you would most like to ask your own father. And you get an answer that is totally useless, because really it has nothing to do with you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Bergman</h4><p begin="00:08:16.40" data-timestamp="496.4">You said, you didn't want to share your quote, &quot;real life,&quot; maybe. But why do you feel that you were forced to lie about that? How could your family have shared your life?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:08:30.44" data-timestamp="510.44">You see the problem is that once you get trapped into doing the thing you think you're supposed to do at a young age-- I married at 23 because I thought it was-- I knew I was gay then already.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Bergman</h4><p begin="00:08:39.76" data-timestamp="519.76">Hm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:08:40.01" data-timestamp="520.01">So did my wife, for that matter. She put it aside.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:51.68" data-timestamp="531.68">Gay men sent Susan Bergman photos of themselves. One happy couple stands there in one of the photos in matching sweaters, raising glasses, smiling. The letter said that if her father had lived and divorced her mother, this is the kind of happiness he could have had. The letters that Susan Bergman got from the children and spouses of gay fathers, she said, seemed to be written in a completely different language than the letters she got from the gay fathers. It was like two different cultures, two different perspectives.</p><p begin="00:09:34.94" data-timestamp="574.94">There are lots of books about men coming out, gay men coming out, gay women coming out. But nobody seemed to be able to remember a book that had been told from the point of view of the children and the wives that these gay men had left behind. And families who are in that situation felt this shock of we are not alone. And they contacted her.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:02.21" data-timestamp="602.21">You brought examples of letters?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Bergman</h4><p begin="00:10:05.12" data-timestamp="605.12">Yeah. The most poignant letter that I got, this woman says she read the book. &quot;Our lives are so similar, Susan, that it was eerie for me to read.&quot; She talks about their background. They were all so fundamentalist. Our family wasn't quite fundamentalist. But this woman says, &quot;Bible believing churches that started in their living room. We had six well-behaved, talented, athletic children in our prosperous and highly visible family.&quot;</p><p begin="00:10:37.75" data-timestamp="637.75">&quot;When my dad was diagnosed in 1988,&quot; she writes, &quot;my mom kicked him out of the house and would have nothing else to do with him. Three of us moved him out of town, encouraged him to change his name, and lied about his mysterious disease and our parent's sudden separation. Now, they are both gone. And we are left to deal with the fraud that was our life.&quot;</p><p begin="00:10:59.77" data-timestamp="659.77">They had just buried their mother-- when she wrote me this letter-- who had died of AIDS because the father didn't protect the mother at all. She says, &quot;I'm writing to you now, not to pour out my heart, but to ask if my sisters and I can come take you out for lunch soon there in Chicago? There are not many like us who have suffered such circumstances. And I know in my heart that I should be able to hold my head high and talk about my mother's needless death without shame. But as of now, I can't.&quot;</p><p begin="00:11:27.92" data-timestamp="687.92">That's the end of that letter. And I talked to this family at length, on several different occasions. They did come to Chicago.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:36.74" data-timestamp="696.74">They did?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Bergman</h4><p begin="00:11:37.43" data-timestamp="697.43">Yeah. Two of the daughters came. Some of the sons were not willing to even acknowledge that the parents had died of AIDS yet, one of them being a physician.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:51.26" data-timestamp="711.26">One of the sons being a physician?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Bergman</h4><p begin="00:11:52.43" data-timestamp="712.43">Yeah. But the interesting story that they have, as her father was dying, they spent hours and hours interviewing their father on tape about his sexual contacts. They got the names of all of the married men that he had been with in this three-city area and the addresses and the phone numbers, which he had. And they began calling those men's wives on the telephone, because they wanted to save lives, because they knew their mother was dying.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:30.00" data-timestamp="750">And so they would call up these women and say, you don't know me but--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Bergman</h4><p begin="00:12:33.35" data-timestamp="753.35">Yup.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:34.15" data-timestamp="754.15">--my father has had sex with your husband.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Bergman</h4><p begin="00:12:36.61" data-timestamp="756.61">Yes. I mean can you imagine that? I mean, of course they debated this among themselves. They thought this is none of our business. But when their mother got AIDS, they knew that this list of 100 married men were not taking any precautions with their own wives. And they started calling. And I said, &quot;Well, what was the reaction?&quot; I asked them to go on. And they said a lot of women hung up the phone them. And some would say, &quot;Oh, thank you very much for calling.&quot;</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:15.29" data-timestamp="795.29">And as you say that, the thing that occurs to me is it's such a complicated act, because partly it's an act of compassion for somebody. And then partly it's such an act of vengeance against somebody else, and calling--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Bergman</h4><p begin="00:13:27.99" data-timestamp="807.99">I know but--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:28.40" data-timestamp="808.4">--out that man.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Bergman</h4><p begin="00:13:29.52" data-timestamp="809.52">I mean if you lose your mother to AIDS, I can see why. I never had to do that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:36.07" data-timestamp="816.07">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Bergman</h4><p begin="00:13:36.53" data-timestamp="816.53">But I'll tell you, in the town I live in, outside Chicago, there is a family, at least one, where the same thing is going on. The father is very promiscuous, a prominent man in town, has four young children. His wife has no idea he's a practicing homosexual. They have unprotected sex. And people in the community come to me and say, &quot;What should we do? We've asked him to tell her. We're thinking about telling her. We want to protect her so that her kids have one parent.&quot; And when I talk to--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:14:15.80" data-timestamp="855.8">And what do you tell them?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Bergman</h4><p begin="00:14:18.82" data-timestamp="858.82">I say that's their decision. They're going to have to really think about that, because I don't know the people. I can't go into their lives just because I wrote some book on some related subject. If they're involved in the family system in some way, they have to make that decision. I have no idea. But when I talk to gay men about this book, who have read it and want to have a conversation, almost everyone has said to me, &quot;Oh yeah, my main partners are married men.&quot; I said, &quot;Well, you have to think about your own responsibility to the family then, I imagine.&quot;</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:15:03.88" data-timestamp="903.88">All these different fathers who contacted you, did any of them say, I'm sorry, I did something that hurt people and I'm sorry?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Bergman</h4><p begin="00:15:16.92" data-timestamp="916.92">Well, no. Because there's a lot of talk trying to defend the position that's just newly being articulated in their lives. And I understand that they're building their ramparts or whatever.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:15:29.79" data-timestamp="929.79">That position being, I was right to at least clear up this lie.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Bergman</h4><p begin="00:15:33.50" data-timestamp="933.5">Finally, I did the one right thing. I left my family and became a true homosexual. That's the right thing, that's being defended in almost all of the letters.</p><p begin="00:15:46.34" data-timestamp="946.34">This is a very interesting letter signed, anonymously yours. He says, &quot;At the risk of intrusion, which is not my intention, I'm compelled to write you and express some gentle viewpoints based on experiences similar to those in your book, but admittedly little real knowledge of your life.&quot; I appreciated that acknowledgement very much.</p><p begin="00:16:09.64" data-timestamp="969.64">&quot;Based on your writing, however, I strongly feel that your father's life with you and your family was not the sham it may superficially appear. I see the story from a different perspective, as that of a tragic, often unconscious struggle by your father to love his family and not end up as one of nature's mistakes, which of course he wasn't. Were there no kisses of bruised knees, soothing of tears and hurt feelings, umpteen occasions of personal denial, dreams of success and happiness for you and the others? Would it be unreasonable to consider yourself doubly-loved, by a fractured psyche fighting desperately against the nature he was given? In retrospect, are not his intents as important as his failures?&quot;</p><p begin="00:16:59.07" data-timestamp="1019.07">It's a beautiful letter in some ways. And in other ways, there are these irritants in these approaches. I shouldn't be so critical I suppose, but then to say to me, were there no kisses of bruised knees? Yes, of course. Yeah, I had a great Daddy in many regards. Yes, he was a split person. And I don't think that he enjoyed being split, and neither does this gentleman. But that doesn't make him a better father. And that's almost the thing that this letter is driving towards, like couldn't you be doubly loved, being loved by a homosexual father? No.</p><p begin="00:17:46.10" data-timestamp="1066.1">I think I was well-loved by my father. I think my father was a split person, and that that destroyed him and it worked towards the destruction of his family. By coming to understand that your family was structured around a lie, that who you were told you were and that the family was, has nothing to do with what you really are or were, that's very complicated.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:18:25.98" data-timestamp="1105.98">Susan Bergman.

  <h3>Act Two: Dad In The Closet</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:20:55.36" data-timestamp="1255.36">Act Two, Dad in the Closet. This next story isn't intended to answer whatever questions Susan Bergman might have about her father. It's intended to answer our questions about these gay men who stay in their marriages, leading double lives.</p><p begin="00:21:11.02" data-timestamp="1271.02">The man we found to interview for this has been married for 26 years, heads a support group, called Review, for men in similar circumstances. He was willing to be interviewed, but he didn't want me coming to his home and he didn't want to come to our studios either. On the phone, I understood this to mean that he didn't feel comfortable appearing in public like this. Later, he told me that I had misunderstood, that he just didn't want to drive that far. In any case, we met in a parking lot on Damen Avenue and drove to a quiet street, where I conducted the interview, in his car.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerry Walters</h4><p begin="00:21:40.37" data-timestamp="1300.37">My name is Jerry Walters.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:21:42.68" data-timestamp="1302.68">Now let me just ask you, is it OK for us to use your name on the radio?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerry Walters</h4><p begin="00:21:45.16" data-timestamp="1305.16">Jerry Walters isn't my real name. It's a name that when I used to work on a hotline, they said pick out a name that you're comfortable with and use that. And so that's what I've been using. Plus, it separates business from my club activities. So Jerry Walters is fine.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:22:02.36" data-timestamp="1322.36">This man is in his fifties, was a teenager during the Eisenhower years. He looked like any suburban dad. He was neatly dressed, in gray wool slacks, a sweater, and what appeared to be a clip-on necktie. He says he was always a good boy. He says he doesn't really get at angry people, doesn't know how to yell at people. Back in high school, he says, he was the kind of boy who'd go out with girls, but never make passes at them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerry Walters</h4><p begin="00:22:26.70" data-timestamp="1346.7">I graduated. I would date occasionally. And I did find somebody that seemed like a very nice person, that we had a lot in common. And we went out on a date. But that afternoon, after I met her in the morning, and that afternoon I had my first gay experience. And so, it was really kind of a red-letter day. I went bowling with her in the evening. And I was out with another man that afternoon.</p><p begin="00:22:56.90" data-timestamp="1376.9">So I thought well, the situation with the other man was scary and disappointing and painful, to say the least. And so I thought, well, fine. That's out of my system. I don't want any more of that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:23:12.57" data-timestamp="1392.57">He went on to marry the girl, who he's still married to nearly three decades later. But soon after their wedding, he became increasingly obsessed with men. He found himself driving out to the forest preserves, where gay men were known to hang out. Men would walk over to his car. Men would try to talk to him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerry Walters</h4><p begin="00:23:30.14" data-timestamp="1410.14">And I would drive out of the forest preserve areas like a bat out of hell, to be perfectly honest. And thinking that, fine, I didn't do anything. So there's no reason for me to feel guilty. But I would end up with headaches that were so severe that I couldn't work. I would come home four or five days a week, and just be incapacitated with the pain. But then I was taking aspirins and Tylenol, and everything else. I got hooked on tranquilizers. And it's a scary thing.</p><p begin="00:23:58.95" data-timestamp="1438.95">When this obsession first takes hold, where first you are thinking about it, and before you know it, you are completely consumed by the thought of doing something with another male. You're not even sure of what you want to do. You're not sure who you want to do it with or where these people are, but you are totally consumed with that quest. Well suddenly, my wife became the person that was stopping me from pursuing what I absolutely, positively had to do to survive. And your thinking gets distorted, would be an understatement.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:24:38.47" data-timestamp="1478.47">Why what happens? What do you start to think about?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerry Walters</h4><p begin="00:24:43.11" data-timestamp="1483.11">Maybe I shouldn't say this and maybe it's unique in my situation, but you think, gee, if she had an accident or something-- yes, I knew-- it sounds bizarre. But you're almost ready to plot to kill somebody. And I've told her this. And it's something that we-- here's a very mild mannered person, almost plotting somebody's demise, because they're stopping you. And they don't even know what's going on at this point.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:13.51" data-timestamp="1513.51">Do you think that at that time, before you told your wife, do think that in a day-to-day way, you had a lot of resentment that you would act out on, you would snap at her, that you would just be short with her? Because what you are describing is being so resentful.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerry Walters</h4><p begin="00:25:27.18" data-timestamp="1527.18">No, I didn't. I held it inside. You see, this was your wife. You can't do this. I'm one of these people that holds the door open for women and very courteous with people. So I held it inside. And you think the top of your head is going to blow off instead.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:42.11" data-timestamp="1542.11">Finally, after two years of marriage, he got up the courage to tell his wife he wanted to have sex with men.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerry Walters</h4><p begin="00:25:47.87" data-timestamp="1547.87">She says, &quot;Oh, is that all?&quot; And I said, &quot;You don't understand. I've got these feelings for men and I don't know how to deal with them.&quot; And she says, &quot;Well, I married all of you. I didn't marry part of you. We'll just figure out how to deal with it.&quot; And so from there, we just set the guidelines that would work for us. I asked her what she needed to be comfortable? She wanted, number one, to know where I would be. And that's fine. I would sooner leave a phone number underneath the telephone, that if I don't show up by 10 o'clock or 12 o'clock, she calls.</p><p begin="00:26:25.45" data-timestamp="1585.45">She wanted me to be home when the kids got home, or when the kids woke up in the morning, which is fine. The term, &quot;are you sleeping with somebody,&quot; I think, is kind of stupid. If I'm going someplace to sleep, I'll sleep at home. I'm going out for sex, not for sleeping. So that was never a problem. That's really the only things. And she said, &quot;I want to be the most important person in your life.&quot; And she always has been and she always will be.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:26:49.73" data-timestamp="1609.73">He says, of course, he uses condoms.

And we're probably the best thing that happened to each other, ever. See, I don't like-- there's a difference between gay feelings and living the gay lifestyle, a dramatic difference. And I know a lot of people will disagree with this and maybe take offense at this. There is an arrested adolescence in the gay community. There is an acceptance of lying because it was needed to survive. And honesty is something that I really put a high price on and I really value it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:27:45.63" data-timestamp="1665.63">I suggest to him that he's the one who lies, by staying in a straight marriage, and not telling his own children he's gay. He says he's not really lying to his children. As he explains it, there's no easy time to sit your kids down and tell them that you're gay. When they're 5 or 10, it'll make no sense. When they hit adolescence, it could be confusing, a kind of burden, as they sort through their own sexual identities.</p><p begin="00:28:07.05" data-timestamp="1687.05">If his children ask him directly he says, then he'll tell the truth.

  <h3>Act Four: Sins Of The Fathers</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:41.90" data-timestamp="2921.9">Act Four, Sins of the Fathers. What does it do to children if parents tell a big lie for years? Part of Susan Bergman's book, <i>Anonymity,</i> is her trying to understand the two parts of her father, strict, religious, family man; promiscuous, gay, night clubber. His personality was split in half, she writes, into two irreconcilable halves.</p><p begin="00:49:05.60" data-timestamp="2945.6">But part of her book is about her discovery that growing up in his home, she became somebody who was also split in half, somebody able to carry on a life with two irreconcilable parts. She found herself as an adult, leading a double life. To end our program, we asked her to read from her book.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Bergman</h4><p begin="00:49:27.42" data-timestamp="2967.42">I pretend I am a faithful wife. My husband is married to that faithful woman. The woman looks like me. She moves around in my body. This is what I mean. You can't tell by looking. He makes love to her. He has asked her a question once or twice, and she has heard herself reply with an avoidance, &quot;Is there anything you haven't told me? I want to know more of you, Susan.&quot;</p><p begin="00:49:56.45" data-timestamp="2996.45">They spent last evening on opposite ends of the house, keeping things going, changing the music, refreshing people's drinks and trays of food. &quot;What makes you ask that tonight after such a great party? All our friends here, scrumptious food. Didn't you enjoy yourself?&quot; She unfastens her gold-beaded bracelet and folds it carefully into its silk-lined box, replacing the lid. &quot;I saw the way Tom looked at you.&quot; &quot;There's absolutely nothing for you to worry about between me and anyone here tonight. Most definitely nothing's up with Tom.&quot;</p><p begin="00:50:33.60" data-timestamp="3033.6">She concentrates on slowing down, as she hangs up her belt and tosses her stockings in a basket of hand washing. &quot;You're doing this jealous thing again. What kind of look?&quot; &quot;Do you have any secrets from me?&quot; &quot;A few.&quot; She'll keep it light. &quot;This is not my natural hair color, quite. But the rest is real.&quot;</p><p begin="00:51:05.52" data-timestamp="3065.52">You must understand that lying is a temporal invisibility. It's the leaves you wrap yourself in when the voice in the garden calls. I was learning to deflect any doubt or question about my faithfulness, back onto the questioner, so that I didn't have to perpetuate the lie. I had for years, part lied, but mostly told the truth. Two and more irreconcilable parts, which let me understand my father, or made me into him. Here was my father's ailment again, his dread of being known.</p><p begin="00:51:45.46" data-timestamp="3105.46">There's a family with children on the line. I force my family to serve as the same kind of false front I was raised to be from my father. Our presence testified to his normality. We failed, no matter how we strove for blessing, to discover the root of our calamity. I can't shake his choice alone, I tell myself. So we slipped and fell, which is human. And he died, stuck. And this gluey lie I keep perpetuating, sticks to me like a curse, revisited on the next generation. My father is in the window when I glance up, and in the hurried tone of my voice, in the shape of my ribs. What if, lights on, as is, he had asked us to love him?</p><p begin="00:52:41.57" data-timestamp="3161.57">I opened the book I had slipped into my jacket pocket and read, &quot;Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell on thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? Or who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity; nor sworn deceitfully.&quot; If her hands are clean and her heart pure, I had been forgiven. But I had yet to go to the man I had wronged, and whom I desperately wanted to love me, to cancel my ongoing lie, my maintaining the family pattern of dishonesty.</p><p begin="00:53:28.70" data-timestamp="3208.7">My husband couldn't bear ever to look at me again. Hadn't my family put him through enough already? Wasn't I a hard pill he had to swallow and swallow? He would remarry within the year, a woman of fidelity and beauty and a way with children, my children. What kinds of stories would they be told about me? All that we had made together-- I took inventory-- did not add up to the ultimate banishment of the untruthful from the presence of God.</p><p begin="00:54:03.53" data-timestamp="3243.53">If you give me the opportunity Lord, one more time, whatever the consequence, I prayed, I will tell the truth. Judson put the question simply, the same one as before. That morning, I had sat in the sun, and read, and drunk my coffee, uninterrupted. Maybe it was a morning unlike any my father had ever been given. When Judson came home later that morning, is when he asked, &quot;Is there something you'd like to tell me?&quot; There was a reason my husband was unable to retire his doubts. I had made an offer of honesty, yes, but hadn't thought the test would come so soon.</p><p begin="00:54:48.40" data-timestamp="3288.4">Walking out on the plank of my own promise, I peered down at the water. First, you leave your father's house, and then your own. There was a deep gulf below me I could not see into. This was the last of my life, as I knew it. &quot;Whatever the consequence,&quot; I said inside my head to remind myself, breathing once. He could tell in the stillness of the pause between his question and my looking back up at him, that his life was changing too.</p></div>  </div>
