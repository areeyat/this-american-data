    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:11.42" data-timestamp="11.42"> The state of Iowa has a little more than three million people. One million come to the State Fair. I'm strolling past the swine barn, and the kids' talent show stage, and the lemonade shake up stands, and the many, many corn dog stands, and the Central Iowa Railroad Club Exhibit building, and the chainsaw art, and the live snakes, and the vast, slowly moving rivers of people.</p><p begin="00:00:33.00" data-timestamp="33">Every one of those million is here on their own personal quest for what they want out of the fair. Stuff they want to do, stuff they want to see, everybody has their own mission. Declan and Killian, for instance, seven and nine years old, brothers from a suburb of Des Moines. They want to see the giant bull. Killian, the big brother, talked to my co-worker, Diane Wu.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:00:57.60" data-timestamp="57.6"> Why are you so excited to see the bull?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Killian</h4><p begin="00:00:59.31" data-timestamp="59.31"> It's one of my favorite animals.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:01:01.38" data-timestamp="61.38"> How come?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Killian</h4><p begin="00:01:02.90" data-timestamp="62.9"> They can see red, and red is my favorite color.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Declan</h4><p begin="00:01:05.97" data-timestamp="65.97"> What?

And they ride a course, shooting burning embers from their guns. They try to pop five balloons with one pistol. Then they change guns, shoot five more balloons with the other pistol, then gallop to the finish line, all without stopping.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adam Ross</h4><p begin="00:02:30.42" data-timestamp="150.42"> Some of these runs we're going to be doing today are going to be nine seconds, because that's less than a second per shot with a gun change. It's a lot happening all at once.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:38.31" data-timestamp="158.31"> Adam Ross is actually ranked sixth in the world at this sport, but somehow, he has never won first place here in his home state of Iowa.

I know that I'm the fastest one here. I have the horse that's the most proven here this year. So as long as I don't beat myself when I go out there and run my match, I know that there's nobody that will compete with me.</p><p begin="00:03:16.01" data-timestamp="196.01">[CHATTER]</p><p begin="00:03:16.95" data-timestamp="196.95"></p><p begin="00:03:17.42" data-timestamp="197.42">[CHOIR MUSIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Group</h4><p begin="00:03:17.89" data-timestamp="197.89"> (SINGING) God will be with you until we meet again</p><p begin="00:03:23.35" data-timestamp="203.35">He blows better floating o'er you</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:28.64" data-timestamp="208.64"> A slightly slower pace over at the replica of Iowa's first church. The original was built in 1834. It's a cozy log cabin, where the goal is to reflect on God's goodness right in the middle of a gigantic, noisy carnival. They hold services twice a day during the fair, where Iowans are not officially permitted to pray, but they are, the guy leading the service says, allowed have to sing prayers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Group</h4><p begin="00:03:51.40" data-timestamp="231.4"> [VOCALIZING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:03:54.65" data-timestamp="234.65"> Thank you.</p><p begin="00:03:55.07" data-timestamp="235.07">[APPLAUSE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:58.98" data-timestamp="238.98"> High above nearly everything at this fair, looking down on everyone, stands Byaunda, age 11, on the giant slide for her very first time.

And she has a simple goal of her own.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Byaunda</h4><p begin="00:04:12.81" data-timestamp="252.81"> So we're going to go on the slide. And I'm very terrified right now because one wrong move, and I'm done.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:18.42" data-timestamp="258.42"> And then she and her sister, Asele, grab their mats and push off.</p><p begin="00:04:23.97" data-timestamp="263.97">[SCREAMING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Byaunda</h4><p begin="00:04:26.91" data-timestamp="266.91"> Oh my god.</p><p begin="00:04:28.38" data-timestamp="268.38">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:04:31.81" data-timestamp="271.81"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:39.17" data-timestamp="279.17"> The Varied Industries building is an enjoyable mishmash of t-shirts and household stuff for sale, but also expensive devices to help your blood circulation or your horse's blood circulation, plus, a guy in one of the more surprising missions at the fair, I thought.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marty Golden</h4><p begin="00:04:53.73" data-timestamp="293.73"> Now, this is--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:54.20" data-timestamp="294.2"> Marty Golden, in a neatly pressed blue uniform and Navy hat, was standing in front of a booth promoting the <i>USS</i> <i>Iowa</i> battleship, a World War II-era ship that's now a floating museum, its restoration paid for in part by grants from the state of Iowa.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marty Golden</h4><p begin="00:05:09.09" data-timestamp="309.09"> We want to make the citizens of Iowa more aware of the battleship <i>Iowa</i> and let them know that anybody that's a resident of the state of Iowa gets on board the <i>Iowa</i> battleship for free. And if they let us know they're from Iowa, we'll take them behind the scenes to places that are not opened up to the general public.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:29.03" data-timestamp="329.03"> But there's a catch. Iowa happens to be landlocked. The ship is docked in Los Angeles, hence Marty's mission to get Iowans out there. Marty did two years in the Navy, 30 years in the Reserves. He served on a ship right off the coast of Havana during the Cuban Missile Crisis. He's also a marine biologist who studied ocean life, retired now. But he loved the Navy enough that now, he's a tour guide on the <i>Iowa,</i> which, again, is in the Port of Los Angeles. Marty is not an Iowan. He lives out there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marty Golden</h4><p begin="00:06:03.52" data-timestamp="363.52"> I miss the Navy so much that I volunteer now about once a week down on the battleship <i>Iowa.</i></p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:09.03" data-timestamp="369.03"> And they flew you out here?</p><p begin="00:06:10.31" data-timestamp="370.31">[CHATTER]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marty Golden</h4><p begin="00:06:12.25" data-timestamp="372.25"> More or less.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:13.28" data-timestamp="373.28"> Oh, you flew yourself out here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marty Golden</h4><p begin="00:06:16.43" data-timestamp="376.43"> I contributed a substantial amount of the effort to get out here.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:22.91" data-timestamp="382.91"> So basically, you said, let me go and do this. It'll be fun. And they're like, great.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marty Golden</h4><p begin="00:06:27.65" data-timestamp="387.65"> Yeah, they probably would have covered all of my expenses, but I believe in the ship. And the ship is always struggling to bring money in to keep operating.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:41.02" data-timestamp="401.02"> So you didn't want to take any money away that could have gone to the battleship?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marty Golden</h4><p begin="00:06:44.86" data-timestamp="404.86"> Correct.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:52.69" data-timestamp="412.69"> The Iowa State Fair began in 1854, just eight years after Iowa became a state. They hadn't even picked a location to build their State Capitol building yet, but they wanted to come together for a fair, for reasons that aren't that different from why we do it today. And what are they?</p><p begin="00:07:08.61" data-timestamp="428.61">I think at a state fair, so much of what's on exhibit is us. We come, with the animals we raised, and our pies and sewing projects, our spelling bee skills, and our expertise at shooting balloons from horseback, and our love for a Navy museum battleship that we think others would love also if we could just tell them about it in person.</p><p begin="00:07:27.96" data-timestamp="447.96">We take in the exhibits and we are the exhibits at a state fair. That's what's so different about a state fair from everything else. Today, we hang out with some of the one million people at the fair and see if they get what they wanted and dreamed of from the fair this year.

So Bailey Leavitt has a different relationship to state fairs and carnivals from most of us.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bailey Leavitt</h4><p begin="00:08:10.75" data-timestamp="490.75"> It always feels good to be back on a midway. When I come out here, I smell it. It just feels like home to me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:16.84" data-timestamp="496.84"> Bailey grew up in carnivals, comes from a family of carnies.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:20.05" data-timestamp="500.05"> Wait, I'm smelling. What is the smell you're talking about?</p><p begin="00:08:22.04" data-timestamp="502.04">[CHATTER]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bailey Leavitt</h4><p begin="00:08:23.31" data-timestamp="503.31"> So I smell turkey legs, for sure. I could smell the cotton candy, that burnt sugar smell. And there's always an underlying kind of grease smell, the diesel smell from the rides and from the generator, which is giving power to all the rides. It's so comforting to me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:40.63" data-timestamp="520.63"> Bailey read on Instagram that we were going to be doing this show about state fairs and she wrote in, talking about her family's life on the road as carnies, mostly out west. I thought it would be fun to walk through the midway with her and see it through her eyes, because she notices all kinds of stuff, big and little, that you and I don't know enough to notice. She grew up with a different vocabulary for everything around us here. She calls all the games joints.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bailey Leavitt</h4><p begin="00:09:03.12" data-timestamp="543.12"> Well, it's a four-sided joint, but then three sides--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:04.99" data-timestamp="544.99"> Cotton candy stands are poppers. Food stands are grabs. Prizes are flash. Carnivals themselves are shows, as in--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bailey Leavitt</h4><p begin="00:09:13.25" data-timestamp="553.25"> He's actually still on that show. And I think he's managing rides now.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:15.67" data-timestamp="555.67"> --a bunch of different shows. 13 independent companies provide the games and rides for the Iowa State Fair. We walk up to a balloon game that must be, I don't know, 20, 25 feet tall, a structure made from aluminum scaffolding with flags and prizes hanging everywhere, and two giant banners saying, bust one wins. Bailey gives it a once over. She's impressed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bailey Leavitt</h4><p begin="00:09:35.58" data-timestamp="575.58"> You can tell that they take good care of the joint because you see how clean all this stuff is, where all those connection points are?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:41.13" data-timestamp="581.13"> You're pointing to the frame of the stand itself.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bailey Leavitt</h4><p begin="00:09:44.08" data-timestamp="584.08"> Yeah, the joints where different pieces link up for this game. All that stuff is really well maintained.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:50.48" data-timestamp="590.48"> Bailey tries to spot who's green help and who's a 40 miler-- that means just there for a bit-- and who's a genuine carny. Before I met Bailey, I honestly wasn't so sure if people still use the word carny or if it has some sort of derogatory, old-timey feeling to it. She told me some carnies hate the word, but she and her family embrace it with pride. These days, Bailey works for a little software company that her mom started.</p><p begin="00:10:11.69" data-timestamp="611.69">Two of Bailey's brothers and her sister are still on the show, and her dad and stepmother were in a show in Alaska that her dad tries to pull her back into now and then. Bailey has happy memories growing up, running around carnivals and state fairs. She could ride any ride or play any game for free, surrounded by adults, her parents' employees, who kept their eyes on her. There were incredibly special days, like stock day, when the stuffed animals for the fair, the stock, would arrive on a giant semi-trailer truck.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bailey Leavitt</h4><p begin="00:10:38.12" data-timestamp="638.12"> And it was a giant pile of toys that I could literally jump in and swim in like a ball pit, but with stuffed animals. That was my favorite.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:48.71" data-timestamp="648.71"> Bailey started to work in the fair for real when she was 10, working a goldfish game.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bailey Leavitt</h4><p begin="00:10:53.28" data-timestamp="653.28"> A four-sided center joint.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:54.96" data-timestamp="654.96"> Bailey's mom, Tyna, joined us for a while in the midway. She was watching Bailey's baby while Bailey and I walked around. Tyna co-managed the family carnival for years and jokes that her kids learned to count by counting money. Says Bailey was great at drawing a crowd, loved the attention, loved performing. When she was little, her flaw as an employee? She did not care about convincing people to spend more money on the game.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tyna</h4><p begin="00:11:17.02" data-timestamp="677.02"> She would sit there and talk to people. And sometimes, she would get in trouble because, if she's talking to people, she's not actually making money. She's just talking to people. But then as she got older, she focused a little bit better, but--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bailey Leavitt</h4><p begin="00:11:31.52" data-timestamp="691.52"> Weird that your child labor didn't pay off like you thought it would.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tyna</h4><p begin="00:11:35.35" data-timestamp="695.35"> Child labor laws do not apply to family, and they learn that very young.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bailey Leavitt</h4><p begin="00:11:39.70" data-timestamp="699.7"> Yes. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:41.24" data-timestamp="701.24"> Is that true?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tyna</h4><p begin="00:11:42.31" data-timestamp="702.31"> It is true. At least, that's what I told them. And they believed me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:47.42" data-timestamp="707.42"> Mom was actually right about that one. Something you don't think about too deeply as a civilian fairgoer, looking for fun, is that for the people working the fair, it really is all about money, how much you can make and how quickly and efficiently you can bring it in. Among other things, a state fair is a collection of small businesses attracted by the massive crowds. And among the people like Bailey, who work games and rides, the workers who make the most money are called agents.</p><p begin="00:12:13.94" data-timestamp="733.94">The word "agent" means different things in different regions of the country among carnies. But where Bailey was a carny, agents were just the best there was, so good at getting families and guys trying to impress their girlfriends to throw money at games that carnival owners would pay them more than anybody else, and they would jump from show to show. They're agents, as in free agents. As we walk through the fairgrounds, the thing that Bailey wanted to show me more than anything was an agent.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bailey Leavitt</h4><p begin="00:12:39.47" data-timestamp="759.47"> Yeah, so an agent is someone who can do what we call putting a mark to sleep, where they're going to be able to kind of put you in this state where alls you want to do is continue playing their game. You want to work towards whatever prize they have you working towards, whether it's popping balloons, or knocking over milk bottles, or whatever. You're going to spend way more money than you planned on at that game. And whenever you get somebody in that state, if you're able to do it really well, it's called putting a mark to sleep.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:08.92" data-timestamp="788.92"> Bailey and her stepdad once watched an agent who put a mark to sleep so well that he spent all of his money, left the game, and then came back with more money.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bailey Leavitt</h4><p begin="00:13:18.06" data-timestamp="798.06"> I'm getting chills as I talk about it. I've never seen anybody do that. Once a mark leaves your game, usually, they're awake and it's done.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:26.01" data-timestamp="806.01"> I wanted to see this. I wanted to see an operator who put somebody to sleep. So we headed out in search of an agent.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bailey Leavitt</h4><p begin="00:13:35.50" data-timestamp="815.5"> There's going to be a lot of agents here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barker 1</h4><p begin="00:13:42.50" data-timestamp="822.5"> Come on up and come on in, guys. Who else wants to have some water gun fun today?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:46.71" data-timestamp="826.71"> We head over to a game where there's a row of 14 chairs in front of 14 targets. The way this game works is you sit and fire a water pistol at the target. When you hit the bullseye, the water goes into a tube, filling it up.

You heard him talking about how he floats around and he just goes to different shows, he doesn't travel with any particular show-- that's all agent stuff. Staying in hotels-- agent. Agent all the way. Not talking about money-- agent. That's all agent moves.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:18:36.83" data-timestamp="1116.83"> So we saw an agent. But the truth is, we never got to see him really do his thing full force, because it was after 8:00 PM. This section of the fair, kiddieland, was dying down. So he never filled more than half the seats in his game. We didn't see him put anybody to sleep and keep them playing and spending money.</p><p begin="00:18:55.92" data-timestamp="1135.92">But there was one more person Bailey and I watched. He was not, strictly speaking, a fellow carny. He was a salesman, a traveling salesman. But Bailey and I both watched him, mesmerized. And he was in one of the prime spots that anybody could possibly get at this state fair for selling anything.</p><p begin="00:19:13.80" data-timestamp="1153.8">This was outside the Varied Industries building, next to the door, and also the corner of the building. So you saw him approaching from two different directions. The Iowa State Fair charges a bunch of extra money for that spot, of course. This guy was calmly making bank-- Kenny Burnell. He sells nozzles for garden hoses.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kenny Burnell</h4><p begin="00:19:34.01" data-timestamp="1174.01"> Well, I have them in any color you want as long as it's green.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:19:37.38" data-timestamp="1177.38"> Some agents, Bailey says, are high-energy, but some are the opposite. They win through calm. That's Kenny. And OK, just to describe his setup, he's standing next to a clear glass box that's maybe two feet by two feet by two feet, spraying water into it with a garden hose, whose nozzle Kenny twists clockwise or counterclockwise to make the spray bigger or smaller.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kenny Burnell</h4><p begin="00:20:04.36" data-timestamp="1204.36"> Going from left to right, you're going to have a little soft soak for potted plants. You've got a heavy rinse. You can get the house, the car, the windows. You got a wide fan. As you turn it, we'll go down to a pinpoint jet spray that'll clean the windows, the siding, and the gutters. And last but not least, you get a fine mist for delicate plants. That way--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bailey Leavitt</h4><p begin="00:20:24.70" data-timestamp="1224.7"> This guy, he puts people to sleep. He's putting marks to sleep.

So yeah, of course he's going to make the sale.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:21:03.31" data-timestamp="1263.31"> With every new group of customers, Kenny hits the product against the ground to show how durable it is. He makes the same jokes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kenny Burnell</h4><p begin="00:21:09.44" data-timestamp="1269.44"> And I have them in any color you want as long as it's green.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Customer 2</h4><p begin="00:21:11.98" data-timestamp="1271.98"> No purple?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kenny Burnell</h4><p begin="00:21:13.06" data-timestamp="1273.06"> No purple yet.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:21:14.26" data-timestamp="1274.26"> When he gets a minute between customers to talk, Kenny Burnell tells me that his grandfather sold at state fairs, and his father. His own first memory of selling is doing a salsa maker demo at the Colorado State Fair one time with his dad when he was five and a half. He enjoyed it. When he was 10, he toured with his parents to state fairs and had his own booth, selling radio-controlled cars. As he got older, he learned to demo kitchen products.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kenny Burnell</h4><p begin="00:21:39.26" data-timestamp="1299.26"> --and was pretty decent at it. But in my early teens, I was like, my heart's really not into kitchen gadgets, just not something I felt. And then I took a liking to this product. And I was like, I want to sell that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:21:55.33" data-timestamp="1315.33"> He wanted to sell that because it has a great visual pitch. It's a quick pitch. Also, the water is loud. It's attention-getting. There's a wow moment when you hit the jet spray. And there's another wow moment when you go to the mist. And another advantage of these things? They're tiny.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kenny Burnell</h4><p begin="00:22:10.77" data-timestamp="1330.77"> You can fit a whole fair's worth of inventory on one pallet.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:22:14.84" data-timestamp="1334.84"> A quick trade show-- he can check all the nozzles he needs into a carry on bag. Way better, he says, than when he sold pillows. It was 24 years ago when he started selling these. Some of his moves today, of course, he doesn't stop talking. Of course, he puts the product in the customer's hand. That's something he saw his dad do.</p><p begin="00:22:32.53" data-timestamp="1352.53">He's learned that to talk for 12 hours straight for a week and a half for a state fair, to preserve his voice, he'll consciously pitch it a little higher or a little lower for stretches at a time. Here in the Midwest, and also in certain cities like Seattle, he said, he mostly does not make direct eye contact during the pitch. I noticed that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kenny Burnell</h4><p begin="00:22:53.14" data-timestamp="1373.14"> I was taught and raised to always make direct eye contact. What I found nowadays is I'll make eye contact roughly three times a demo. That's what I aim for-- one in the beginning, one in the middle, one right at the end when you're explaining the warranty and how much they are, but not too much, because I've done that a few times at this fair, where I'm making-- I'm demoing and doing it East Coast style. I'm making direct eye contact, and you can see them kind of looking off down the aisle. And they're just intimidated. And I don't want that. It's--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:23:27.64" data-timestamp="1407.64"> It's too aggressive to do the eye contact.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kenny Burnell</h4><p begin="00:23:29.26" data-timestamp="1409.26"> It's too aggressive, yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:23:31.90" data-timestamp="1411.9"> Kenny, this is Bailey, who's worked a ton of fairs, a ton of carnivals.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bailey Leavitt</h4><p begin="00:23:36.56" data-timestamp="1416.56"> I grew up in the carnivals.

Bailey wanted to know why he didn't use one. Kenny was like, I usually do, but I had a problem with my mic and then a problem with my backup mic. Bailey was sympathetic. They liked each other. Game recognizes game. In my line of work, I have to say, putting somebody to sleep means you are not doing your job right. It's one of the worst things you can say to somebody.</p><p begin="00:24:07.18" data-timestamp="1447.18">When I told Kenny that's what Bailey said about him, he laughed and decided to take it as the compliment it was. He ended up selling $33,000 worth of nozzles over the course of the fair. That's 877 nozzles in 11 days, or put another way, for 12 hours a day, every single day, Kenny sold an average of one hose nozzle every 10 minutes.</p><p begin="00:24:39.92" data-timestamp="1479.92">Coming up, we go on a roller coaster of sorts, one filled with bunnies. That's in a minute from Chicago Public Radio when our program continues.</p><p begin="00:24:52.52" data-timestamp="1492.52"><i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Today's show, "Meet Me at the Fair," we hang out with some of the 1.2 million people who came to the Iowa State Fair this year to see if they got what they hoped for. And we'll get back to that in a second. But first, let me tell you a story. Back in 2013, the band Motley Crue was getting older. One of its founding members had gotten a degenerative disease. The drummer, Tommy Lee, was going around saying they wanted to stop doing shows before they had to start replacing bandmates.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tommy Lee</h4><p begin="00:25:22.14" data-timestamp="1522.14"> That's such a bad look, when bands are still playing the [BLEEP] fairgrounds.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:28.79" data-timestamp="1528.79"> A year later, Tommy Lee said, we are not playing county fairs.

The band said yes. And then a day later, we were told they would still love to talk to us, with one condition. They would not discuss playing state fairs.</p><p begin="00:26:16.02" data-timestamp="1576.02">In other words, Motley Crue is chicken. So I just want to say to the band right now, our offer is still good. We actually do want to hear what this is like for you to do this. Reach out if you change your minds.

What's your name?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Molly Fox</h4><p begin="00:27:30.35" data-timestamp="1650.35"> I'm Molly Fox.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:27:32.24" data-timestamp="1652.24"> Molly has shown rabbits at the county fair before, but this is her first year at the state fair, the big time. She's waiting in line to present the incredibly fuzzy black rabbit in her arms, a breed called Lionhead, named for the poof of mane it's supposed to have around its head. This competition is about presentation skills, demonstrating your knowledge about your animal's breed to a panel of three judges. Molly tells me she's not nervous. She carries her bunny to the judges' table.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Judge</h4><p begin="00:27:59.74" data-timestamp="1679.74"> All right, you may start whenever you are ready.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Molly Fox</h4><p begin="00:28:03.06" data-timestamp="1683.06"> Hi. My name is Molly Fox, I'm 12 years old, and I'm from Hamilton County. This is Onyx. He is a junior buck Lionhead, and his color is black. First, I'm going to check the ears. Let me find the ear tattoo. There's so much fluff.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:28:24.60" data-timestamp="1704.6"> Molly flips Onyx onto his back and opens his little rabbit mouth so his teeth show. So she's checking for buck teeth, pegged teeth.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Molly Fox</h4><p begin="00:28:32.29" data-timestamp="1712.29"> Malocclusion, wolf teeth, and broken or chipped teeth.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:28:36.93" data-timestamp="1716.93"> The goal here is for the kids to look for the things a veteran judge would look for if they were evaluating this rabbit. Molly runs through the checklist she memorized with her dad, ears, nose, teeth, and then wraps it up with this professional assessment.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Molly Fox</h4><p begin="00:28:54.42" data-timestamp="1734.42"> I would like to see more of the wool type of fur on his hind legs. But overall, he is a very-- he is an excellent rabbit.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:29:07.50" data-timestamp="1747.5"> Molly has learned her 4H lessons well. The judges have no questions. She gets 94 points out of 100. Most of the kids I meet are proud of their rabbits. They talk about how soft they are, how nice their markings are, except for Jillian King, who is 11 and who has absolutely had it with her rabbit.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jillian King</h4><p begin="00:29:30.54" data-timestamp="1770.54"> Because he's molting and he's really ugly right now.

And holy hell, I am telling you, these bunnies are some good-ass-looking bunnies, with that kind of calm demeanor that comes with effortless beauty. One is brownish-gray with dark brown ears that stick up in a regal way and hair that seems feline. The other one has a classically pretty bunny face, light brown, chubby cheeks, button nose. He's sitting up like a dog-- or like a bunny, I guess-- his eyes locked on the back of Chacho's fuzzy head.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:30:44.47" data-timestamp="1844.47"> Wow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jillian King</h4><p begin="00:30:45.03" data-timestamp="1845.03"> These two are very up to breed standards.

His hair didn't grow out as well, but he's also molting. So he's losing a lot of it right now, but it'll grow back.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:31:14.28" data-timestamp="1874.28"> He's going through an awkward phase right now, though. Poor guy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jillian King</h4><p begin="00:31:16.66" data-timestamp="1876.66"> But he's still not as good as these guys. These guys would beat him in a regular show.

And then the judge awards the rabbit handler a ribbon. Confoundingly, purple is the best, followed by blue. A blue ribbon says your rabbit is up to breed standards, but isn't exceptional enough to get a purple. Next is red, which means your rabbit is a delinquent, and then white, which means you are a delinquent.</p><p begin="00:31:49.59" data-timestamp="1909.59">Jillian and her older sister Jenna are both having a bad "hare" day.

Jenna says Martini and her sister, Tequila, don't really like people. She bred them herself, choosing to pair a rabbit named Whiskey with good coloring to a lady rabbit named Fawn, who has a great face split. Out of that blessed union, Martini was born.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jenna</h4><p begin="00:33:09.40" data-timestamp="1989.4"> It was the week that things got really cold in January, like, negative 40.

It was my first litter, too. So that was a little bit rough, but you can't let it hold you back. You only get better the farther along you go. You can't really quit in the beginning.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:33:39.16" data-timestamp="2019.16"> Well, I guess you could if you wanted, but--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jenna</h4><p begin="00:33:41.21" data-timestamp="2021.21"> Yeah, but--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:33:43.03" data-timestamp="2023.03"> Jenna and I have a difference of opinion here.

She does not have snuffles, which is rabbit sniffles. She's just allergic to the sawdust they put in all the rabbit cages at the fair.

But I could see another lesson appearing on the horizon, one about the inevitability of disappointment, how disappointment leads to growth, how you don't need some technocrat from the bunny industrial complex to hand you a ribbon to know in your heart that you've got an outstanding rabbit.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:34:42.19" data-timestamp="2082.19"> How does that make you feel?

  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:37:20.49" data-timestamp="2240.49"> Act Three, Limp Biscuit. So every Iowan that I talked to outside the fair this year, when I mentioned that I was going to the fair, what we would end up talking about was food and what to eat. Food is a big thing at so many state fairs. News coverage of Iowa's fair always includes the latest stuff, like this year's bacon cheeseburger egg roll.</p><p begin="00:37:40.15" data-timestamp="2260.15">There are nearly 200 food stands at the fair, and they rarely become available for people who want to try to create the next hit themselves. Those spots are highly coveted because there's so much money to be made. Fair's management says that some vendors earn their entire annual income for the year at those 11 days at the fair. Chris Benderev had followed one family that tried to jump into the game this year.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:38:02.12" data-timestamp="2282.12"> Of the handful of new food stands at the fair this year, it was obvious which one would be the most interesting to watch. It's run by a couple, Jamie and Jennifer Adkins. And as best as I can tell, they're different from the other food stand managers at the fair in one important way.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:38:17.28" data-timestamp="2297.28"> So you guys have not run a restaurant before?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jennifer Adkins</h4><p begin="00:38:20.98" data-timestamp="2300.98"> That's correct.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:38:21.93" data-timestamp="2301.93"> And you guys haven't run your own stand at another state fair before.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jennifer Adkins</h4><p begin="00:38:27.25" data-timestamp="2307.25"> Correct. This is our first big gig.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:38:30.09" data-timestamp="2310.09"> All the other new food stands in Iowa this year are owned and run by people in the restaurant business, or they've done other big fairs. So how did Jamie and Jennifer end up doing this? Well, for a long time, Jennifer had dreamt of opening her own coffee shop. Then her husband saw this opportunity, not to launch a coffee shop exactly, but to launch an 11-day-long state fair version of it.</p><p begin="00:38:52.35" data-timestamp="2332.35">He heard about a food stand that was withdrawing from the state fair. They could save money by buying its used trailer and equipment. Jennifer could sell coffee drinks, and they'd do some food on the side-- biscuit sandwiches, they decided, because there aren't many vendors selling breakfast at the fair. And so they jumped in and prepared to launch Biscuit Bar. But when I talked to them in July, before the fair opened, they each had very different expectations for how much money they'd make.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jennifer Adkins</h4><p begin="00:39:18.13" data-timestamp="2358.13"> I tend to be more frugal and conservative about finances, so I'm really just hoping to be able to help pay for some of the expenses that we've had. That's really what I'm hoping for.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:39:35.05" data-timestamp="2375.05"> Jennifer just wants to break even, cover all their costs, but she told me she didn't think they'd do that. The costs were too big. They'd spent $300,000 for the trailer and all the equipment. And that's before you get to salaries and food costs. Plus, the State Fair takes 19.5% of every dollar every food vendor brings in. Jamie, her husband, owns a successful trucking business. And when I reached him by phone, he was confident they'd make everything back this first year.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jamie Adkins</h4><p begin="00:40:04.31" data-timestamp="2404.31"> It'll work. I guarantee that it'll work. No doubt about it. It'll work. It's just how much the profit is. My personal thought for this year was, I'd like to do about gross sales of $300,000, $350,000 on the minimum side. It's kind of like going to the casino. [LAUGHS] You go there to win. You just hope you win more than you lose.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:40:29.97" data-timestamp="2429.97"> This kind of confidence, of course, is exactly what you'd need if you're an amateur and you decided you're going to get into any part of the restaurant business, a notoriously difficult business to make money in. But Jamie has a cousin, Joni, who runs two popular, very successful food stands at the fair. Jamie's helped her out a little in the past. And seeing his cousin's operation made the idea of raking in lots of cash seem way more possible, at least for him. Again, here's his wife, Jennifer.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jennifer Adkins</h4><p begin="00:40:59.03" data-timestamp="2459.03"> Probably for him, because it really looks effortless for her. She's just so good. And there's no way I'd ever be able to get up to her level. And I think for him, she really is inspiring, for sure. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:41:18.68" data-timestamp="2478.68"> Could that be almost a tricky thing because she makes it look deceptively simple?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jennifer Adkins</h4><p begin="00:41:23.42" data-timestamp="2483.42"> Possibly, yes.</p><p begin="00:41:32.00" data-timestamp="2492">[CLATTER]</p><p begin="00:41:33.49" data-timestamp="2493.49">6:30 AM, August 8, the first day of the fair. And this, employees scraping cooked food out of pots into storage containers, is the sound of a food stand about to debut itself to Iowa. The gates of the fair don't open until 8:00 AM, so let me give you a sense of the place. Right now, I'm in the open-air kitchen that's behind Biscuit Bar. This is where all the raw materials, meats and eggs and biscuits, are cooked, and then get passed into the trailer, where they're assembled into sandwiches. Everyone's calm. They're ready.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:42:04.12" data-timestamp="2524.12"> Can I ask what you guys are doing at this point?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeff</h4><p begin="00:42:06.76" data-timestamp="2526.76"> Cleaning tubs.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:42:07.87" data-timestamp="2527.87"> Cleaning tubs.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeff</h4><p begin="00:42:08.57" data-timestamp="2528.57"> All our-- we got all our stuff made.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:42:10.78" data-timestamp="2530.78"> The trailer Jamie and Jennifer paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for is gleaming, with a green and pink facade, emblazoned with real pictures of biscuit sandwiches, but also cartoons of friendly anthropomorphized biscuit sandwiches. The word "espresso" appears in four places. And then at the top, outlined with dots of neon lights in big letters, Biscuit Bar. There are three registers out front, each with a teenager behind it.

It's a lot of work, but it's worth it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:55:06.50" data-timestamp="3306.5"> Jamie told me he was completely unfazed when he saw the numbers come in.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:55:10.39" data-timestamp="3310.39"> You didn't feel anything about, well, I guess we're going to be a little short of kind of half of what I wanted?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jamie Adkins</h4><p begin="00:55:17.07" data-timestamp="3317.07"> No. No.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:55:19.83" data-timestamp="3319.83"> I think a lot of people would have a hard time adjusting to that reality, or less.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jamie Adkins</h4><p begin="00:55:25.07" data-timestamp="3325.07"> I wouldn't.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:55:26.07" data-timestamp="3326.07"> Wait, really? I mean, you're a really blunt guy, Jamie. But on this one thing, I got to say, I don't know if I believe you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jamie Adkins</h4><p begin="00:55:34.26" data-timestamp="3334.26"> Yeah, no, you can believe me. I deal with it all the time. My trucking business, a couple of years ago, done right at $12 million in sales, gross sales. And we won't even be $8 million, probably, this year. I've been in business long enough that I know that just because you made that much money yesterday don't mean you're going to make it today.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:56:01.98" data-timestamp="3361.98"> I didn't appreciate at first just how much Jamie sees opening a business at the fair as being like a trip to the casino. When he predicted that they'd make $300,000 to $350,000 their first summer, that wasn't because he'd done some careful calculations, counting the number of biscuits you could sell each day.</p><p begin="00:56:19.51" data-timestamp="3379.51">It was just a wish. He was going to put his money down on the table, roll the dice, and hope for the best. And even though it'll take years before they pay off Biscuit Bar's debts, Jamie is already encouraging Jennifer to open up her coffee shop this upcoming spring. Jennifer isn't so sure if the finances will work. Jamie, though, he feels lucky.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:49.78" data-timestamp="3409.78"> Chris Benderev, he's one of the producers of today's episode.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act Three: Limp Biscuit</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:54.46" data-timestamp="3414.46"> Act Four, Last Stand. Saturday night, the part of the park with rides for little kids closes down at 10:00 PM I stopped by there a little before that, wondering if I can talk to Jeremy, the agent of the watergun game.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry</h4><p begin="00:57:09.21" data-timestamp="3429.21"> Come up. Look, I got a family special here for you guys. Closing special, guys. If I get four people to play, whoever wins gets a big choice prize.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:16.48" data-timestamp="3436.48"> That hoarse, exhausted-sounding person is Barry, who's doing stock, handling prizes for Jeremy earlier in the day. Now, Jeremy's the one handling prizes, and Barry is on the mic.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry</h4><p begin="00:57:25.97" data-timestamp="3445.97"> Right here, are you ready? Have a seat. That's one. I need at least two to start.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:30.98" data-timestamp="3450.98"> There are a few straggler families left, and they are keeping themselves as far as they can from Barry, holding a distance of maybe 35, 40 feet. They look beat, and they are not interested in Barry's shenanigans on the mic. Finally, one woman sits down at the game.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry</h4><p begin="00:57:45.20" data-timestamp="3465.2"> I got one in the door. I need at least one more person to start. I see you peeking out there. You can't win it by looking at it, girl. Come on, give it a shot. Show them how it's done.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:52.13" data-timestamp="3472.13"> Second woman pulls up in a motorized wheelchair. Barry pleads with people to sit. And when I ask him what this is about--</p><p begin="00:57:58.50" data-timestamp="3478.5">[CHATTER]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry</h4><p begin="00:57:59.48" data-timestamp="3479.48"> We're $100 short from our goal tonight.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:58:02.27" data-timestamp="3482.27"> Jeremy tells me that they have a goal to bring in $10,000 that day for the game.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry</h4><p begin="00:58:06.24" data-timestamp="3486.24"> Give it a shot. Look.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:58:07.16" data-timestamp="3487.16"> And I want to be clear, this was not management that set this goal. Jeremy did, he said. That's the number he wanted to hit. He and Barry each got a percentage of that $10,000. And they decided on how much they wanted to make for the day. And then they were going to use everything they had to make that number, begging people to sit down.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry</h4><p begin="00:58:25.35" data-timestamp="3505.35"> There you go. I got two in the door. I'm looking for two more. What? I need more than two.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:58:30.95" data-timestamp="3510.95"> Barry ends up running a modified two-person version of the game for a smaller prize and keeps going with more rounds.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry</h4><p begin="00:58:37.69" data-timestamp="3517.69"> Who's ready? Who's next?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:58:38.60" data-timestamp="3518.6"> 10:00 comes. The rides around us starts shutting down. Ferris wheel lights go off. That feels weird. This gigantic, multi-colored bright thing, suddenly pitch dark. Very tired clumps of people wander past it towards parking lots. But the water gun race is an island of light and noise.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry</h4><p begin="00:58:57.50" data-timestamp="3537.5"> Come on. Come on. Last race. Last race of the night. Have a seat, guys. Come on. One more time. We're going to give another big one away, guys. Last race of the night. Last race of the night, guys. Come on up. Give it a shot. One more person.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:59:06.54" data-timestamp="3546.54"> They finally run their last race four minutes after 10:00.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry</h4><p begin="00:59:09.11" data-timestamp="3549.11"> 3, 2, 1.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:59:10.12" data-timestamp="3550.12"> Four minutes after this part of the park officially closed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry</h4><p begin="00:59:12.34" data-timestamp="3552.34"> Don't spill. It's neck and neck. It's toe to toe. Go, go, go, go, go. Who's it going to be? Stop, watch, and see. Number!</p><p begin="00:59:18.47" data-timestamp="3558.47">[BELL RINGING]</p><p begin="00:59:19.56" data-timestamp="3559.56">Winner, winner, winner. 22, any prize, any size. All right, guys, have a great rest of your night. Thank you all. Appreciate you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Customer 4</h4><p begin="00:59:27.73" data-timestamp="3567.73"> Whatever.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Customer 5</h4><p begin="00:59:28.44" data-timestamp="3568.44"> I didn't win.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:59:29.31" data-timestamp="3569.31"> They're done. Sound system is off. They made their goal, they told me. Jeremy said, when 10:00 hit, of course, they had to keep going.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeremy Buvier</h4><p begin="00:59:38.82" data-timestamp="3578.82"> We had a goal. We needed $5 more. All right, we got to flash.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry</h4><p begin="00:59:44.80" data-timestamp="3584.8"> Yeah, we got to do stuff.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:59:47.19" data-timestamp="3587.19"> Got to flash means they're not done for the night. They have to head over to where the prizes are stored, get some prizes, come back to the game, and put them in place for tomorrow. He said they started to work around 9:00 that morning. It was 10:00 at night. They had another hour's work to go. We kept going, Jeremy said, because we like money.</p></div>  </div>
