  <h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.28" data-timestamp="0.28"> A man walks into the main branch of the San Francisco Public Library one Monday earlier this month. He's a balding gentleman named John Peters, and he's looking for books by the Marxist political theorist, Antonio Gramsci.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Peters</h4><p begin="00:00:11.79" data-timestamp="11.79"> He's an Italian radical. And what I'm seeing is everything has been taken out several years ago. I'm wondering, are these stolen? Or has somebody-- and I know of one case of this-- deliberately not wanted people to see these books?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:37.33" data-timestamp="37.33"> If this is a conspiracy to suppress the 20th century's greatest theorist of cultural hegemony, it is not a very effective conspiracy. It takes the helpful librarian less than two minutes to find, on the shelves of the fourth floor, a book of Gramsci's selected political writings.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Librarian 1</h4><p begin="00:00:50.29" data-timestamp="50.29"> So here's the call number. So that's how you find it on the shelf, OK?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Peters</h4><p begin="00:00:53.36" data-timestamp="53.36"> OK.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:53.62" data-timestamp="53.62"> Five of us went to libraries around the country that day, according to the reference desk. And one of the things that we found everywhere were even-tempered, unflappable librarians. Like at the Palo Verde Public Library in Phoenix, a library user named Cindy, in a maroon sweatshirt and fanny pack, broke into song to get the librarian to understand exactly which Amy Grant Christmas album she wanted.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Librarian 2</h4><p begin="00:01:14.27" data-timestamp="74.27"> No.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cindy</h4><p begin="00:01:15.24" data-timestamp="75.24"> (SINGING) Mary, did you know that your baby boy--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Librarian 2</h4><p begin="00:01:18.89" data-timestamp="78.89"> Oh, I've heard the song.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:20.56" data-timestamp="80.56"> That same day on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in Montana, at the Medicine Spring Library, a woman asked the librarian, Aaron Lafromboise, if they have anything on the Motokiks, the traditional women's society in the tribe.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aaron Lafromboise</h4><p begin="00:01:32.03" data-timestamp="92.03"> You know, I don't know if there's anything actually written about Motokik.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:01:35.54" data-timestamp="95.54"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aaron Lafromboise</h4><p begin="00:01:38.22" data-timestamp="98.22"> Yeah, one of my aunties is in there. And so when I got my Indian name, she sang me an honor song from the Motokiks. So it was really amazing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:01:48.16" data-timestamp="108.16"> Really?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aaron Lafromboise</h4><p begin="00:01:49.19" data-timestamp="109.19"> So I'm thinking you might have to search a little more.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:54.83" data-timestamp="114.83"> They look for books together and don't find much. The books are written mostly by non-natives and men, which can I say? Good example of cultural hegemony.</p><p begin="00:02:07.61" data-timestamp="127.61">Same afternoon, on the other side of the country in the Jackson Heights branch of the Queens Public Library in New York City, upstairs in the children's section, high school kids hide out on the floors of the stacks. A teenager by the computers downloads an immigration form, I suppose, for her parents. This is, everybody says, the most ethnically-mixed neighborhood in Queens, with books in English, Spanish, Chinese, Korean Urdu, Hindi, and more. Two happily confident third graders, named Katherine and Adam, friends from the libraries after school program, Stacks, walk up to the librarian with a request.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adam</h4><p begin="00:02:38.72" data-timestamp="158.72"> I want to know that any books have words but no pictures.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Librarian 3</h4><p begin="00:02:44.96" data-timestamp="164.96"> Yes. Words but no pictures?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adam</h4><p begin="00:02:48.04" data-timestamp="168.04"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Librarian 3</h4><p begin="00:02:49.67" data-timestamp="169.67"> Most of our books have at least a little picture.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:54.24" data-timestamp="174.24"> Even the chapter books have drawings at the start of each chapter, the librarian explains. The kids let her know that this is acceptable. Not ideal, but acceptable.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adam</h4><p begin="00:03:03.35" data-timestamp="183.35"> I want to have a book with a challenge reading because-- do you know I'm almost fifth grade?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katherine</h4><p begin="00:03:10.55" data-timestamp="190.55"> No, you're third grade. How can you be almost fifth grade?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Librarian 3</h4><p begin="00:03:12.91" data-timestamp="192.91"> OK, here, this book might be--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adam</h4><p begin="00:03:13.99" data-timestamp="193.99"> But I want a really challenge. I want a challenging one. And I think I know there's a one here. Can you go to the front over there?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:23.38" data-timestamp="203.38"> He marches the librarian towards the books for older kids. Best as I can figure out, Adam somehow got it into his head that day that he had just had it with picture books. And as soon as he said this, Katherine was like, oh, me too. Though once Adam walked away, she told me it was her own independent decision.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katherine</h4><p begin="00:03:39.79" data-timestamp="219.79"> It's that now that I'm bigger, I don't want to really have more pictures. I want to mostly just use my imaginations for reading.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:53.81" data-timestamp="233.81"> People use the library for so much more than books, though. In just that one Monday, the five of us who went out to record, we witnessed a woman printing out fliers to find her lost dog. We witnessed old people getting help with their email. One librarian told me that in her job, you really get in touch with just how many people really do not know how to use computers at all.</p><p begin="00:04:11.62" data-timestamp="251.62">We saw a homeless guy research apartments he might be able to afford. We heard about power tools you could check out to do your home improvements when you have a place and lights for seasonal affective disorder you can check out. A library got on the phone and then arranged for a patron to get a new walker and get it delivered to him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Librarian 4</h4><p begin="00:04:26.91" data-timestamp="266.91"> Will you be there between 5:00 and 7:00 tonight?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:04:30.54" data-timestamp="270.54"> Yes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Librarian 4</h4><p begin="00:04:31.15" data-timestamp="271.15"> Yes. 5:00 and 7:00 tonight works.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:33.44" data-timestamp="273.44"> The librarian from suburban Detroit that I spoke with, Annie Spence, described libraries the best, I thought.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Annie Spence</h4><p begin="00:04:38.93" data-timestamp="278.93"> I always say that it's the only place-- well, it's one of the last places you can go that you don't have to buy or believe in anything to come in. You can just come, and we'll help you, no matter what your question is. We'll try to figure it out with you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:57.19" data-timestamp="297.19"> In the <i>Harry</i> <i>Potter</i> books, there's this place called the Room of Requirement. The way it works is you walk three times in front of this certain patch of wall at Hogwarts, thinking, like, I really need a coffee. And then suddenly in that room a coffee shop will appear. Or, I need a place to make my magic potion in secret, and then a room with all the ingredients for your magic potion will appear.</p><p begin="00:05:17.04" data-timestamp="317.04">Libraries are like that. But in real life. That's what they do. And today on our program, we have stories of very unlikely uses for these Rooms of Requirement, all driven by people who want something very, very specialized. Something which, in every single story in today's show, the library is able to deliver. From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One: In Praise of Limbo</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:46.17" data-timestamp="346.17"> Act One, In Praise of Limbo. So we start our show today with a library in a very unusual place, and with people who want something very unusual from that library. Zoe Chace explains.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:05:58.18" data-timestamp="358.18"> The library sits on the border between Canada and the US. I mean, literally on the border. Like there's a faded black line running along the floor to show you which country you're in. The books are mostly in Canada. The front door is in America. So entering from the US is easy.</p><p begin="00:06:12.68" data-timestamp="372.68">But if you're coming from the Canadian side, to get to the door, you have to venture for about 20 yards into American territory on an American sidewalk. How can you tell you've crossed over? Flower pots. A row of flower pots. Yeganeh Torbati is a Reuters reporter who was there recently.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yeganeh Torbati</h4><p begin="00:06:29.50" data-timestamp="389.5"> So the flower pots are there to demarcate the border between the United States and Canada.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:06:35.18" data-timestamp="395.18"> It's just-- it's like, sorry, we just have to show you that this little line exists, but we're trying to make it as sweet as possible.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yeganeh Torbati</h4><p begin="00:06:44.75" data-timestamp="404.75"> And in the spring, those flower pots are blooming, and it's quite beautiful. Of course, when I was there, it was quite dead. So it's really just a line of flower pots with dirt in them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:07:02.24" data-timestamp="422.24"> The place is kind of famous, gets tourists. When Barack Obama was speaking during a state visit from the Canadian Prime Minister, he mentioned the library as this harmonious symbol of Canadian-US ties. A library is an inherently welcoming place. Its whole ethos is this is for everybody. That's the spirit of this library in two countries at once.</p><p begin="00:07:22.64" data-timestamp="442.64">That's not why we're talking about it, though. We're talking about something happening inside the library that's making things kind of tense. That's why Yeganeh was there. She covers immigration. She's been writing about the travel ban since January 2017. And the list of countries has changed as the ban has changed. But Iran? Iran has always been on the list of banned countries.</p><p begin="00:07:45.42" data-timestamp="465.42">There are a lot of Iranian students in the US here on single-entry visas. Single-entry means if they leave, they can't just turn around and re-enter. They can't go home to see their families. And because of the travel ban, their families can't visit them here, so there's no way for them to see each other. But Iranians can get to Canada, and this library is in Canada. And Iranian students in America can get to this library because this library is also in America.</p><p begin="00:08:12.86" data-timestamp="492.86">So that's what they've been doing, meeting at this library in two countries at once. Yeganeh went up there and waited outside the library on a Saturday morning.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yeganeh Torbati</h4><p begin="00:08:21.86" data-timestamp="501.86"> Almost immediately, this woman walked in, who herself was an Iranian student. And she was dressed for the winter weather and in a winter coat. And she looked kind of anxious, and I could kind of tell that she's Iranian. And so I started talking to her, and she said that yes, indeed, she was trying to meet her parents.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:08:41.42" data-timestamp="521.42"> They spoke in Persian. Yeganeh is Iranian-American, actually. Her parents came here as students.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yeganeh Torbati</h4><p begin="00:08:47.06" data-timestamp="527.06"> And I had earlier saw her being questioned by US border patrol agents. And so I asked her what had happened in those interactions because I had heard that border patrol agents were objecting to these reunions and were at times trying to stop people from carrying them out. But she said that they questioned her, they examined her documents, and they asked her if she was here to see her family. And she said yes, and they said great, that's very normal. A lot of people do it. And they let her into the library.</p><p begin="00:09:20.59" data-timestamp="560.59">And then maybe about 10, 15 minutes after she first arrived, I kind of hear this bit of commotion. The door of the library is like pretty creaky, and old, and kind of noisy. And these three or four people come in. We were in the second reading room, furthest from the door. And you just see this woman in a headscarf and a winter coat, and she just starts rushing in.</p><p begin="00:09:48.85" data-timestamp="588.85">And her daughter gets up from the table where I was sitting with her and walks over to her really quickly, and they just embrace. And immediately, tears are flowing. And it's just this really intense and very intimate and private moment. But there was no loud crying. There was no sobbing. There was no loud talking</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:10:13.69" data-timestamp="613.69"> Yeah because it's in the library.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yeganeh Torbati</h4><p begin="00:10:15.22" data-timestamp="615.22"> [LAUGHS] Yeah. It's just this subdued environment, and they're trying to-- they're both expressing all their emotions, but also trying to fit them into the space.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:10:28.21" data-timestamp="628.21"> Around this family are kids with headphones on, on computers, parents with kids in the children's reading room. All the library stuff is happening. The librarians stay out of the way, which seems like an acquiescence to these meetings, but there are these new signs up around lately. No eating, no packages, and no family meetings.</p><p begin="00:10:48.20" data-timestamp="648.2">Yeganeh heard that the US and Canadian authorities had threatened to shut the library down, and she asked them about it. The Canadians denied it. The US had no comment.</p><p begin="00:10:57.76" data-timestamp="657.76">In the library, Yeganeh sees families ignore the signs. This student flew from Michigan. Her family came from Iran for only a few hours together. It seems crazy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yeganeh Torbati</h4><p begin="00:11:07.90" data-timestamp="667.9"> And then around, I want to say 11:00, another Iranian family entered.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:11:14.95" data-timestamp="674.95"> It's been three years since this mother has seen her son. She and her husband come in with their other son, who lives in Canada now. He and his brother look like twins.</p><p begin="00:11:23.71" data-timestamp="683.71">These parents have been visiting their son in Canada for weeks. And all this time, they've been trying to figure out, is there any way we can see our other son who lives in Ohio? They couldn't solve it, but just before the parents were scheduled to fly back to Iran, they heard about the library, and everyone rushed there for a few hours.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yeganeh Torbati</h4><p begin="00:11:41.14" data-timestamp="701.14"> That was also really emotional. I didn't see the exact moment of their embrace, but I saw their goodbye. And that was very difficult to watch.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:11:48.57" data-timestamp="708.57"> What happened?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yeganeh Torbati</h4><p begin="00:11:51.42" data-timestamp="711.42"> So the brother who's living in the United States, he hugged his mother, and you can just see him sobbing into her shoulder. Then they separate, and she has this very tear-stained face and is putting her coat and scarf back on. And then he hugs his father and, again, buries his face in his shoulder. And the father, I heard him say to his son, take care of yourself. Please take care of yourself.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:12:24.93" data-timestamp="744.93"> A lot of these families talk every day, multiple times a day. Like they know exactly how the other person is doing, what's going on in their life. But still, they fly, rent a car, drive to the border. Shirin Estahbanati, another student, drove up from New York to see her parents who'd flown from Iran. Reuters put up a video of her interview about the visit.</p><p begin="00:12:45.99" data-timestamp="765.99">Shirin is this glowing, young face. Her emotions are just written right across it. Her dad had had a heart attack recently. She was so anxious to see him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Shirin Estahbanati</h4><p begin="00:12:55.65" data-timestamp="775.65"> I don't know. The time I was just hugging my parents, I was thinking, I wish I could stop all clocks all over the world. I can't explain how tough it was, especially about my dad. I thought even he is shorter than the time I left. I don't know. The time he met me, he started smelling me, and he was like, I miss your smell. So-- [SNIFFLES]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:13:39.74" data-timestamp="819.74"> I'd been thinking of the idea of this show, of libraries as the magical Room of Requirement from <i>Harry</i> <i>Potter.</i> I think this is exactly that. Like imagine these Iranian students in America, thinking, I need a magical place that is somehow in America but also outside it. It seems like an impossible one. It's like a very particular only at this time in America would this exact requirement exist. And a room appeared, a reading room.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:14:16.23" data-timestamp="856.23"> Zoe Chace, who's one of the producers of our show.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act Two: Book Fishing In America</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:14:19.52" data-timestamp="859.52"> Act Two, Book Fishing in America. OK, so our program today, of course, is about people who want libraries to satisfy some very deep, and sometimes, very idiosyncratic desires. And the people in this act, they wish for a library that can give them something that only ever existed inside the pages of a book. Sean Cole, tell us what happened.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:14:40.67" data-timestamp="880.67"> There's this book I've always really loved, a novel by Richard Brautigan. If you haven't heard of him, he was a really funny, almost surreal, hippyish writer in the '60s and '70s, probably best known for the book, <i>Trout</i> <i>Fishing</i> <i>in</i> <i>America,</i> a very short and deeply experimental piece of fiction, part travelogue, part fever dream. It's what made people cultish about Brautigan. A kid who went to my college legally changed his name to Trout Fishing In America.</p><p begin="00:15:06.04" data-timestamp="906.04">But the novel I'm talking about is lesser known. It's called <i>The</i> <i>Abortion,</i> subtitle, <i>An</i> <i>Historical</i> <i>Romance</i> <i>1966.</i> And it's not so much the story that gets me. It's the setting. It takes place in a library in San Francisco. But instead of coming to take books out of the library, people come to submit unpublished books they've written to the library, forever.</p><p begin="00:15:29.20" data-timestamp="929.2">The books are there to stay. They can bring a book in anytime. The library never closes. And the librarian-- there is only one-- is always there to greet them. He lives at the library, and he's the narrator of the story.</p><p begin="00:15:44.03" data-timestamp="944.03">This is from the first chapter. The librarian says, "We don't use the Dewey decimal classification or any index system to keep track of our books. We record their entrance into the library in the Library Contents Ledger, and then we give the book back to its author, who is free to place it anywhere he wants in the library, on whatever shelf catches his fancy.</p><p begin="00:16:06.91" data-timestamp="966.91">It doesn't make any difference where a book is placed because nobody ever checks them out and nobody ever comes here to read them. This is not that kind of library. This is another kind of library."</p><p begin="00:16:19.55" data-timestamp="979.55">The librarian is reflexively polite and effusive. He might say to someone, "I don't think we have a book like this in the entire library. This is a first." He puts people at ease. He says, "My clothes are not expensive but they are friendly and neat and my human presence is welcoming."</p><p begin="00:16:36.11" data-timestamp="996.11">Eventually, a woman comes in with a book, and she's very beautiful. They fall in love. She gets pregnant, but they're not ready to have a child. So because this takes place in 1966, the two of them travel to Mexico to get an abortion, which is why the novel is called <i>The</i> <i>Abortion.</i> But just the spectacle of this library, it's hilarious, and heartbreaking, and democratic, and other-dimensional all at the same time.</p><p begin="00:17:00.70" data-timestamp="1020.7">Brautigan imagined a great anonymous wash of humanity marching through, with a lot on its mind. Kind of the Utopian ideal of the public square, except completely silent, all written down on rows and rows of unread books. The librarian says the main purpose of the library is, quote, "to gather pleasantly together the unwanted, the lyrical and haunted volumes of American writing." And when you talk to other people who've read <i>The</i> <i>Abortion,</i> the conversation usually winds its way to this one chapter.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Todd Lockwood</h4><p begin="00:17:30.48" data-timestamp="1050.48"> "The 23?"</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:17:31.46" data-timestamp="1051.46"> "The 23." [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Todd Lockwood</h4><p begin="00:17:33.02" data-timestamp="1053.02"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:17:33.86" data-timestamp="1053.86"> This is Todd Lockwood, a photographer and music producer in Burlington, Vermont. I'll tell you why I got in touch with him in a minute. "The 23" is essentially a list of all 23 books that came into the library this one particular day, by little kids, old people.

In 1991, about a year after the library opened, the Bumbershoot Arts Festival in Seattle asked Todd if he wanted to set up a mini version of the library at the festival, an exhibit. So Todd, his wife, and about 100 of the books they'd amassed up to that point got on a plane, flew out there, and set up shop in this indoor event space.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Todd Lockwood</h4><p begin="00:27:05.92" data-timestamp="1625.92"> And so first day at the exhibit, I'm showing people around.

The part where one twin in a fairy tale figures out why she's been wearing half a locket around her neck the entire time. Todd hadn't known it, but no other writer had as much of an impact on Kinsella's life and career as Richard Brautigan.</p><p begin="00:28:35.13" data-timestamp="1715.13">In 1985, Kinsella published a book of weird, vignettey short stories that he called his Brautigans. He dedicated the collection to Richard Brautigan, including, in the dedication, a fan letter he'd written to Brautigan, in which he said, quote, "I have just written a novel about a man who drives from Iowa to New Hampshire, kidnaps JD Salinger, and takes him to a baseball game at Fenway Park. He was talking about <i>Shoeless</i> <i>Joe.</i> That was part of the plot.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:29:05.96" data-timestamp="1745.96"> And so you're both kind of shocked.

[LAUGHING] I was like, perhaps someway or other, Brautigan himself is playing some sort of role in all this. That we're like marionettes, and he's up there just with a great big smile on his face, just having a blast, messing with the real world.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:29:34.77" data-timestamp="1774.77"> Or haunting it somehow, like he was saying, playfully, better not forget me. I wanted to talk with Bill Kinsella for this story, but he died in 2016 on September 16, the same day Richard Brautigan had died in 1984. Both of them chose that day to end their lives. Kinsella was terminally ill and opted for doctor-assisted suicide, which is legal now in Canada, where he's from. Brautigan shot himself with a revolver.</p><p begin="00:30:10.22" data-timestamp="1810.22">The Brautigan Library chugged along in its original location for about six years. But as Todd once wrote in an issue of the library newsletter, reality can be so clankingly real at times. By 1996, fewer and fewer manuscripts were coming in. Money was tight. Here and there, Todd had to make ends meet with funds from his own bank account.</p><p begin="00:30:29.47" data-timestamp="1829.47">And finally, the entire Brautigan Library was moved to a room in the Fletcher Free Library, the regular public library down the road in Burlington. It stopped accepting new books but people could still come and read the ones that existed. 10 years went by, and then the Fletcher Library decided it needed the space for other things. So all The Brautigan Library books, more than 300 of them, found themselves shrink wrapped on a wooden pallet in Todd Lockwood's basement.</p><p begin="00:30:58.00" data-timestamp="1858">And this is the moment in the library's history when I first heard about it. I've been wanting to tell this story and see the books for myself for about 10 years. But way back when Todd and I started talking about this, he said he needed to wait, that he was in negotiations with a couple of academic libraries that might be interested, couldn't do an interview until something was finalized, et cetera and so on. Certainly the books weren't available to look at. I said I'd keep checking in, but I didn't.</p><p begin="00:31:22.67" data-timestamp="1882.67">And then this past summer, I started thinking about the library again. So I looked it up, and the library had finally found a new home in Vancouver, Washington, about 3,000 miles away from where it was born.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Barber</h4><p begin="00:31:34.42" data-timestamp="1894.42"> Watch your head here, low ceiling.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:31:36.83" data-timestamp="1896.83"> And it had a new librarian, John Barber, a professor at one of the universities in town.

He was a student of Brautigan's and hung out with him.</p><p begin="00:32:09.01" data-timestamp="1929.01">So naturally, he was a big supporter of the library from early on. And when the library shut down, he was sad to think of all the books being mothballed in Todd's basement. Until finally, he just got inspired and organized to have them all moved to this place. And he's taken on the mantle of the librarian.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Barber</h4><p begin="00:32:24.88" data-timestamp="1944.88"> Also, I should say, Richard Brautigan once told me that he would haunt me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:32:31.87" data-timestamp="1951.87"> Wait, he said, I will haunt you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Barber</h4><p begin="00:32:34.39" data-timestamp="1954.39"> Yes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:32:35.86" data-timestamp="1955.86"> This was in 1982, two years before Brautigan killed himself.

And he does.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:33:51.97" data-timestamp="2031.97"> After all, John, for all intents and purposes, now inhabits a physical manifestation of an idea Brautigan had in his head. And what's a little startling when you meet John is that he is the librarian from the novel. Like he's just like him. His clothes are not expensive but friendly and neat, and his human presence welcoming.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Barber</h4><p begin="00:34:11.45" data-timestamp="2051.45"> Yes, we look an awful lot alike.

I alone have the answer. Just like with a lot of the books in Brautigan's novel. For instance, there's the most prolific contributor to The Brautigan Library, Albert E. Helzner.</p><p begin="00:37:30.05" data-timestamp="2250.05">He's got 19 books here, three under an assumed name. And they're mostly comprised of his own personal scientific theories and observations. Titles like <i>A</i> <i>Revolutionary</i> <i>Way</i> <i>of</i> <i>Looking</i> <i>at</i> <i>the</i> <i>Earth</i> <i>as</i> <i>a</i> <i>Planet,</i> or, more to the point, <i>The</i> <i>World</i> <i>is</i> <i>Wrong.</i> The only way I can think to describe it-- and I do so admiringly-- it's like PhD-level stoner thinking. Everything and everyone in the Helzner-verse is interconnected and impactful.</p><p begin="00:37:57.62" data-timestamp="2277.62">In his book, <i>October</i> <i>6,</i> <i>1990,</i> Helzner said that every year on October 6, he'd go to the maternity ward of a hospital, look at a newborn baby through the glass, and ask himself, how did this birth come about? What is the long-range effect? And what is the significance of any birth? Addressing the baby he went to see in 1990, he says he wants to tell her what transpired on the day before she was born.</p><p begin="00:38:22.10" data-timestamp="2302.1">"I spent the whole day thinking about you," he writes. "On that day, the moon was shining on my town of Marblehead, Massachusetts. It was a bright full moon sitting in a clear sky. My wife and I drove to Seaside 5 Corners for a bite to eat.

After their book had been in the collection for a while, we'd hear back from them, hear back from writers who would say, wow, this really is a weight off. I just feel like the project is done finally. Even though it technically was finished, it's the fact that it's sitting on a shelf in a public place, where someone that that person doesn't know will cross paths with that book, and take it off the shelf, and perhaps read it. That sort of completes the circle, and I can get on to the next thing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:41:08.79" data-timestamp="2468.79"> It's funny to think about, but in some ways, The Brautigan Library is more like the library in the novel now than it ever has been. The books are housed in a building that looks more like the Presidio branch. They aren't often read by anyone. And it has one librarian, who actually is available at all hours of the day and night to accept new books, but only digitized ones, PDFs submitted online.</p><p begin="00:41:30.71" data-timestamp="2490.71">But the more I think about it, it's not about how perfectly or imperfectly Todd or John turned a fictional place into a real one. That's not the point. It's that Richard Brautigan in his novel predicted with perfect accuracy what would happen if you did create a library like this. That being there would give you a feeling like you're walking down the street and noticing that everyone has a book they've made tucked under one arm, a jumbled woolly individual transcription of how the world feels to that person.</p><p begin="00:42:00.74" data-timestamp="2520.74">It's the feeling of being able to read everyone's mind for a moment and being startled by their unedited thoughts because they're nothing like yours, but they're just as weird. It's like the librarian says in chapter two of the novel, "There just simply had to be a library like this."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:22.45" data-timestamp="2542.45"> Sean Cole, who's one of the producers of our program.

We have arrived at the third act of our program. Act Three, Growing Shelf Awareness.</p><p begin="00:43:10.95" data-timestamp="2590.95">This act is about somebody returning to the library that she went to as a kid, wanting something very specific and very personal out of that experience.

It's this huge stone building with Roman columns, built over 100 years ago. And as soon as we pass the front door, Lydia stops dead in her tracks, looks up at the large, echoey rotunda above us, and gets quiet.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:43:39.43" data-timestamp="2619.43"> Do you remember how you felt walking into the library when you were a kid?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lydia Sigwarth</h4><p begin="00:43:44.25" data-timestamp="2624.25"> It was my favorite part of each day, and I always had a plan. I always came with a plan of what I wanted to do.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:43:52.84" data-timestamp="2632.84"> This was her favorite place growing up. She only lives half an hour away now, but she hasn't been a patron here in nearly two decades. Back when she was six, Lydia, her mom, and her six siblings used to spend a lot of time here. Like a lot of time. They spent all day, almost everyday here for about half a year, while they were homeless.</p><p begin="00:44:18.09" data-timestamp="2658.09">We walk past a World War I exhibit into an airy space filled with nonfiction books and people working on computers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lydia Sigwarth</h4><p begin="00:44:24.54" data-timestamp="2664.54"> This was where the children's department used to be, I'm pretty sure.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:44:29.16" data-timestamp="2669.16"> We go around the crafting zone into a quiet area by a big floor-to-ceiling window that looks out on the street.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:44:35.04" data-timestamp="2675.04"> This was a very warm spot because of the window. I remember it being very cozy and warm.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:44:41.46" data-timestamp="2681.46"> There's some cushion chairs here. Those are new. Back then, they'd sit on the floor.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lydia Sigwarth</h4><p begin="00:44:46.50" data-timestamp="2686.5"> My little brother would take his nap here. This was a quieter spot, where we're sitting right now. And I remember my eldest sister holding my little brother who's two at the time. And he was sleeping, and she would quietly read a book out loud to me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:45:04.50" data-timestamp="2704.5"> This used to be next to a big shelf, where they kept all <i>The</i> <i>Boxcar</i> <i>Children</i> books. They were free to run around unassisted, without parents hovering over them, to do whatever they wanted. If you think about it, libraries are kind of one of the only public spaces where kids have freedom like that. And so Lydia ran through the stacks, and crawled around on the play rug, or just stared out of this big window, her favorite, near where her baby brother used to sleep.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lydia Sigwarth</h4><p begin="00:45:29.16" data-timestamp="2729.16"> I forgot about this. So the entrance is below us right now. And I would watch people come in and out because we'd be here for hours at a time. And I would watch people come in and then wait for them to come back out and see how many books they had.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:45:50.67" data-timestamp="2750.67"> Lydia came from a stable family, but when they moved from Denver to Dubuque, they had a tough time finding a place they could afford. So they crashed with friends and family, moving every month or two. Lydia remembers all nine of them, crammed together in someone's basement. She and her five sisters all slept together on a big L-shaped couch, with blow-up mattresses in the middle. And every morning, Lydia's mom would pack up all the kids and take them to the library.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lydia Sigwarth</h4><p begin="00:46:15.63" data-timestamp="2775.63"> I think that's why they took us here, is to give the family we were staying with privacy, but also to give us our own measures of privacy.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:46:23.64" data-timestamp="2783.64"> Because it's so big. You could--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lydia Sigwarth</h4><p begin="00:46:25.59" data-timestamp="2785.59"> We could spread out and have our own spots. So I had spots here, and you can't have a spot in a furnished basement shared with eight other people.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:46:38.61" data-timestamp="2798.61"> Her parents did such a good job pretending that they were just on a fun adventure, that Lydia didn't register any of this as painful or difficult. She didn't even really understand that their family was going through anything, until she was having a conversation at work about a year ago, talking about homeless people coming to the library.</p><p begin="00:46:56.10" data-timestamp="2816.1">It came rushing back to her. Wait a minute, that was me. She honestly had never thought about it for almost two decades.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lydia Sigwarth</h4><p begin="00:47:04.33" data-timestamp="2824.33"> And I'm sitting in this meeting, like almost crying, like I teared up. I was like, how did I never realize this before? And how did we never talk about this? And then I was like, it's because it wasn't traumatic. We were fine. We were happy. We were fed, and clothed, and taken care of. So there was nothing wrong. Because I remembered that time so fondly, that I was like, oh, that was the year we lived in the library. It was the best time ever.</p><p begin="00:47:48.46" data-timestamp="2868.46">I just remember the feeling that it gave me, of belonging. I get really emotional thinking about it because I credit Mrs. S for most of it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:48:05.97" data-timestamp="2885.97"> Mrs. S was the children's librarian. Lydia's favorite spot in the library was by her desk.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lydia Sigwarth</h4><p begin="00:48:11.22" data-timestamp="2891.22"> It was a round desk, like a half moon round desk. So I would make a beeline over here and make my demands known. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:48:21.98" data-timestamp="2901.98"> Every morning, all seven kids would run in and spread out over her library. But every day, Mrs. S would greet them warmly. She'd stroll the stacks with Lydia, helping her find something to read. They had conversations about books and about life. Lydia remembers this one day in particular, when Mrs. S came up to her with a recommendation.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lydia Sigwarth</h4><p begin="00:48:41.36" data-timestamp="2921.36"> I remember her putting aside the book, <i>The</i> <i>Twelve</i> <i>Dancing</i> <i>Princesses,</i> for me. I remember her bringing it to me and saying that this came back, and I thought of you right away when I saw it because you have sisters. So I got this for you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:48:58.43" data-timestamp="2938.43"> It was the first book that felt perfect for her. The youngest princess in the book was the heroine, and she was also the youngest sister in her family. She was sure Mrs. S was telling her that she was special.</p><p begin="00:49:15.17" data-timestamp="2955.17">Lydia wanted to find Mrs. S for a few years because she had such great memories of her, but who exactly was she? Lydia had no idea what the S stood for, like what her real last name was. She visited the library once to ask, and they said they weren't sure. It had been decades. But there was a Mrs. Stephenson who had worked here a long time. Only problem was she couldn't talk to her that day because she was on vacation. So Lydia just went home.</p><p begin="00:49:42.55" data-timestamp="2982.55">Then about a year ago, when all of the memories of her being homeless came flooding back, she wrote a long email to say thank you and sent it to Mrs. Stephenson. But she never got a response. Lydia thought, it's probably not the right Mrs. S, or maybe she doesn't remember me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lydia Sigwarth</h4><p begin="00:49:57.75" data-timestamp="2997.75"> We get to go to the staff only. Very exciting.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:50:02.34" data-timestamp="3002.34"> So I'll just tell you. I called ahead, and yep, Mrs. Stephenson was Mrs. S. And yes, she totally remembered Lydia. So we went to see her in the staff only area. It was the first time Lydia had seen her since she was a little kid. Mrs. S was sitting in a big, warm office, decorated with paintings of cows and pink monsters. And when she saw Lydia, she rushed out with her arms wide open and grabbed her into a huge hug.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mrs. Stephenson</h4><p begin="00:50:27.18" data-timestamp="3027.18"> [LAUGHS] Hi, sweetheart.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lydia Sigwarth</h4><p begin="00:50:30.01" data-timestamp="3030.01"> Hi.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mrs. Stephenson</h4><p begin="00:50:30.78" data-timestamp="3030.78"> Aww, you look the same.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lydia Sigwarth</h4><p begin="00:50:33.86" data-timestamp="3033.86"> Do I?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mrs. Stephenson</h4><p begin="00:50:34.60" data-timestamp="3034.6"> Yes, just taller.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lydia Sigwarth</h4><p begin="00:50:36.00" data-timestamp="3036"> Do you remember me?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mrs. Stephenson</h4><p begin="00:50:37.38" data-timestamp="3037.38"> I remember your family.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lydia Sigwarth</h4><p begin="00:50:38.94" data-timestamp="3038.94"> Aww because we were here all the time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mrs. Stephenson</h4><p begin="00:50:41.23" data-timestamp="3041.23"> Mm-hmm.
