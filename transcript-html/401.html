  <h3>Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.49" data-timestamp="0.49">Dave was in his late 20s, and it would not be accurate to say that he was living at home with his parents, but only because half the time he was staying at his sister's house. He was playing in a band, doing some writing, not making much money, and his parents were worried. And one day he was hanging out with his mom.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Hill</h4><p begin="00:00:15.74" data-timestamp="15.74">We were coming home from going ice skating together, which right there you can see that out. To be fair, I like ice skating. I'm a quarter Canadian.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:23.64" data-timestamp="23.64">Wait, wait, wait. You can see what? What does that show that you went ice skating with your mom?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Hill</h4><p begin="00:00:27.33" data-timestamp="27.33">Well, most guys, after a certain age, wouldn't go regularly ice skating with their mom to like [? organ ?] sessions where you're skating arm in arm around. I mean this is the sort of stuff I would do with my mom, like pretty regularly.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:42.63" data-timestamp="42.63">So they pull into the driveway. Dave's mom tells him there's going to be a benefit for this retirement home for nuns and priests. His mom's an old school Catholic who goes to mass every day. And she says it's going to be at a hotel in downtown Cleveland. They live in Cleveland. And Maureen McGovern, who sang the theme to <i>The Poseidon</i> <i>Adventure</i> back in the '70s was going to be the entertainment.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Hill</h4><p begin="00:01:00.01" data-timestamp="60.01">And she's like, so I'm getting tickets. So let me know if you want to go. And I said, no, I don't want to go. And then, so she just said, OK, well just let me know then. She's like, because I have to get the tickets in the next couple of weeks. And I figured, I didn't give it any thought, but then it kept coming up over and over. Like, let me know, the benefit's coming up and I need to buy tickets. So are you going to go? And I said, no. And she said, all right, well I need to know by next week if you're going to go. And this just went on and on for a couple of weeks.</p><p begin="00:01:35.74" data-timestamp="95.74">This was a big thing. My mom kept saying like, and there will be nuns and priests there. Like they're going to get some of the old nuns and priests from the retirement place out. You can walk up and touch them and stuff. I don't know why she made that a selling point.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:50.91" data-timestamp="110.91">Maybe that was a selling point for her. Maybe she likes nuns and priests.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Hill</h4><p begin="00:01:54.07" data-timestamp="114.07">She does.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:54.61" data-timestamp="114.61">And she knows some of the old ones from back in the day.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Hill</h4><p begin="00:01:57.55" data-timestamp="117.55">Oh yeah, she's super into nuns and priests.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:59.98" data-timestamp="119.98">And these weren't just the regular nuns and priests that she see's everyday on the ball field. These are some of the older players. You have the cards, you know, but you never see out of the stadium anymore.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Hill</h4><p begin="00:02:09.30" data-timestamp="129.3">Yeah, exactly. It was like the fantasy league. Like Father Mackey from St. Anne's in 1952.</p><p begin="00:02:28.05" data-timestamp="148.05">So there's a lot of that going on. And then, somewhere along the line, my mom brings up the fact that a priest that used to teach at my high school when I was there, Father Dennis, was recovering from two heart attacks. And so she's like, you know, I ran into Father Dennis up at church. And I was telling him about the benefit. And he was really into it. Yeah, I bet he would like to come to this benefit also. Why don't you bring him? And I was like, I'm not going. And she's like, well, I already told him you were going to call.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:05.46" data-timestamp="185.46">So Dave realizes he's trapped. Checkmate. He's going to have to at least call Father Dennis.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:11.62" data-timestamp="191.62">And Father Dennis, was he just like another teacher at the school or was he somebody who you especially liked?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Hill</h4><p begin="00:03:17.22" data-timestamp="197.22">I liked him. Yeah, I mean I knew him. He ran the choir. Yeah, I thought he was a great guy. He loaned me his guitar. He played guitar. So it wasn't like we had kept in touch or anything. You know, I had fond memories of him. But I hadn't seen him in years.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:31.24" data-timestamp="211.24">So he gets Father Dennis on the phone and they agree that Dave is going to pick him up and they'll attend the event together.</p><p begin="00:03:36.76" data-timestamp="216.76">Comes the big day, it goes exactly as you might imagine a lunchtime fundraiser for retired nuns and priests in a hotel in downtown Cleveland with Maureen McGovern singing usually goes. Now there were a couple of wild card moments to the day that I'll run through quickly for you.</p><p begin="00:03:48.22" data-timestamp="228.22">First, Dave runs into a friend at the event from grade school-- now gay-- whose Dave mom is convinced that they should set up with one of Dave's sisters, even though Dave tries to keep explaining to her that Guy is gay.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Hill</h4><p begin="00:03:59.01" data-timestamp="239.01">And she thinks that I'm being mean, insulting him by calling him gay. I'm like, no, he's a gay man. That's fine. And just explain to me why it's not going to work out?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:12.34" data-timestamp="252.34">Second, the luncheon buffet turns out to be mostly fried foods. None of which can be eaten by Father Dennis, who's still recovering from his two heart attacks and requested a special low fat meal. Though Dave's mom has come prepared for this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Hill</h4><p begin="00:04:25.07" data-timestamp="265.07">She sort of like, looks around real quickly and then reaches under the table. And she snuck in a bag of bread and like sandwich meats thinking that we could just make some sandwiches for him at the table. And I'm just horrified.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:44.33" data-timestamp="284.33">Father Dennis tells her very politely, thanks, but no. He doesn't want a sandwich. And eventually the waiters do arrange for him to get some sort of meal. At their table are some very old people, Dave's parents, Dave, and Father Dennis.</p><p begin="00:04:56.86" data-timestamp="296.86">There's no drinking, which Dave says might have really helped things. And after a while, Dave and Father Dennis have run out of small talk.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Hill</h4><p begin="00:05:03.64" data-timestamp="303.64">So it's getting quiet and we're sitting next to each other. At some point, Father Dennis turns to me and he's sort of like, you know, I don't know. Normally I understand why I'm somewhere. If I'm invited somewhere I know why. But I guess I don't know. I don't know why I'm here. I'm really confused. I don't feel any connection to this. And I was just like, what? What do you mean? I thought you wanted to be here. I thought that was the whole thing. That's why I'm here. I thought you wanted to be here.</p><p begin="00:05:41.46" data-timestamp="341.46">And he says, no. Your mother told me that you wanted to be here and that you really wanted me to go. So I thought that I should do it for you and your mom. And we're just sitting there, like oh gosh. We've been just duped by what I thought was a really nice lady.</p><p begin="00:06:04.28" data-timestamp="364.28">My mother just tricked us into this.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:21.05" data-timestamp="381.05">Did you ask your mom afterwards about the whole thing?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Hill</h4><p begin="00:06:24.13" data-timestamp="384.13">Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:24.81" data-timestamp="384.81">And did she explain what she was hoping was going to happen once she got you and Father Dennis together?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Hill</h4><p begin="00:06:30.69" data-timestamp="390.69">No, she just kept saying like, oh, I just thought it would be a really nice time for you. For both of you. She was very invasive about it. And I confronted her saying, do you think like that I'm going to hang out with his priest and then I'm going to want to become a priest? And she's like, no.</p><p begin="00:06:52.35" data-timestamp="412.35">She wouldn't admit to that, and that's maybe--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:54.46" data-timestamp="414.46">But you think that's what it might be? Like in the back of her mind she's just like, maybe you're single, you're in your late 20s. Maybe you should be a priest?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Hill</h4><p begin="00:07:02.91" data-timestamp="422.91">Maybe. Or at least have some sort of like priestly influence. I think there was like a bigger thing, but she'll never tell me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:20.26" data-timestamp="440.26">Dave says this was par for the course. His mom often mystified him. And a certain amount of her parenting, of any parenting really, is putting your kids into situations you know are going to be good for them whether they like it or not. Or even, whether they understand it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Hill</h4><p begin="00:07:34.02" data-timestamp="454.02">There's been a number of things over the years that I just could not wrap my head around why she was making me do it. And I really thought she was torturing me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:44.18" data-timestamp="464.18">Like what?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Hill</h4><p begin="00:07:46.36" data-timestamp="466.36">She made me take typing lessons that I could not fathom why. I was like 13-years-old, 14-years-old. It just seemed just random, like here's something that I'll hate. I'll just make him do it. And like, now, literally like it didn't even hit me until like the last few years when I realized that a huge part of everyday for me, I'm typing all the time. I remember seeing that one day and be like, oh my God. That's why she made me endure that horrible summer of typing lessons. Literally, 20 years later I figured it out why she did that to me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:33.61" data-timestamp="513.61">From WBEZ Chicago it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i> distributed by Public Radio International.

  <h3>Act One: Letter Day Saint</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:25.12" data-timestamp="565.12">Act 1, Letter Day Saint.</p><p begin="00:09:28.03" data-timestamp="568.03">Sometimes a parent can do something kind of extraordinary, really above and beyond what most people do with the best of intentions, just looking out for their kid. And do I even need to say that they can have all kinds of unintended consequences. David Segal has this example.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:09:44.24" data-timestamp="584.24">In 1991, Elizabeth Gee was dying of cancer. And as she thought about the time she had left to live, she worried about her only child, Rebecca. Then 16 years old. And she discussed her worries with her husband.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gordon Gee</h4><p begin="00:09:56.71" data-timestamp="596.71">She just looked at me one night. I mean, she was hooked up with all of this stuff.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:10:01.37" data-timestamp="601.37">This is Gordon Gee.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gordon Gee</h4><p begin="00:10:02.68" data-timestamp="602.68">And she just looked at me. She said, you know, I really feel that I need to continue to be an influence on Rebecca's life and continue to be part of her life. She knew she was terminal. She knew that she only had about a month to live. And she made this discrimination that she was going to write letters to her daughter.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:10:23.09" data-timestamp="623.09">Specifically, birthday letters. The plan she told Gordon was this. She would write letters that he would send to Rebecca, one per year, every year, on December 4, Rebecca's birthday. The letters would be sealed and for Rebecca's eye's only. There were 13 of them. Each tailored for a specific birthday. Plus a letter for the day of Rebecca's wedding. Rebecca didn't know any of this until the first letter, which she read the day she turned 17.</p><p begin="00:10:51.07" data-timestamp="651.07">To a daughter reeling from the loss of her mother, it was the ultimate birthday present.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rebecca</h4><p begin="00:10:55.83" data-timestamp="655.83">She said in one of my first letters that these were a way to connect to her. That all I had to do to connect to her was to open a letter. And then she would be there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:11:04.96" data-timestamp="664.96">One of the early letters arrived on a birthday at college, when she was feeling particularly isolated.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rebecca</h4><p begin="00:11:10.24" data-timestamp="670.24">And this letter said basically, you will never be alone. You will never be alone. You will always have me. And I just remember feeling this incredible feeling of peace. It almost felt like getting a letter from someone who was alive.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:11:35.33" data-timestamp="695.33">It happened the same way every year. Gordon, a college president for most of his professional life, now at Ohio State University, would overnight a sealed envelope, adding a brief card of his own. And every year, Rebecca went through a birthday letter ritual.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rebecca</h4><p begin="00:11:50.12" data-timestamp="710.12">Usually sometime in the afternoon before dinner I'd sit down and open it and read Dad's note. Feel the page, look at her signature. Usually it'd be the first thing. And think, gosh, that's just so amazing that she's gone and I'm looking at her signature and it's saying I love you. And then I'd read through it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:12:14.09" data-timestamp="734.09">Each letter was about 2,000 typed words on thick white paper signed by hand, &quot;You're the sweetest girl in the world. Or just, &quot;Love forever, Mommy.&quot;</p><p begin="00:12:24.24" data-timestamp="744.24">Elizabeth told Gordon that she wanted to describe the world as she saw it, and as Rebecca would see it as a young woman. And she does so in the letters with a mix of pep talks, moral instruction, autobiography, and parental affection. Often she focuses on what was happening to her on the age Rebecca would be when she opened each letter.</p><p begin="00:12:42.52" data-timestamp="762.52">So when Rebecca turned 21, Elizabeth described a dress she owned when she was 21. Quote, &quot;You would not believe what I wore. A black fake fur suit with a pink top and the plastic ping pong earrings. Everyone thought it was fashionable, but I laugh when I think of it.&quot;</p><p begin="00:12:59.67" data-timestamp="779.67">A lot of the letters are advice on how to live. Quote, &quot;Most children benefit from the simulation of daycare,&quot; she writes. Urging Rebecca not to give up her career when she has children. Quote, &quot;You are not a uni-dimensional person. Under that balance, you will be frustrated.&quot;</p><p begin="00:13:16.00" data-timestamp="796">And her mother had high expectations. In one letter she asks her daughter, &quot;Are you contemplating a dissertation? Interviewing with scientific laboratories or NASA? Traveling to excited places?&quot; Rebecca pushed herself to meet those expectations.</p><p begin="00:13:29.36" data-timestamp="809.36">In college when her friends were out drinking, she stayed in and studied. Other kids might have found this all a little too heavy, Rebecca found it inspiring.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rebecca</h4><p begin="00:13:39.51" data-timestamp="819.51">For example, when I decided I didn't have the confidence to go to medical school and I wasn't going to do it, the letter that year basically said, you need to find ethical expression in your work.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:13:50.54" data-timestamp="830.54">She ended up going to medical school.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rebecca</h4><p begin="00:13:52.59" data-timestamp="832.59">There was just no way I could have become a banker in the setting of these letters. I mean not that bankers don't have ethical expression, but for most of college, I think I had this enormous sense of purpose that I had a responsibility to do something meaningful. Both to me and to other people.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:14:14.05" data-timestamp="854.05">As galvanizing as these letters could be, they could also be upsetting. The first person to fully appreciate how upsetting they were was her father. He was the one who dealt with the fall out. He saw that keeping his promise to his wife meant causing his daughter emotional distress. And on her birthday.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gordon Gee</h4><p begin="00:14:30.69" data-timestamp="870.69">It was as if I could predict the sunrising. Rebecca would get the letters and then, I'd receive either that night or the next morning, a very tearful telephone call about how much she missed her mom. And I'd have these prolonged telephone calls.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:14:45.61" data-timestamp="885.61">What sort of things would you talk about?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gordon Gee</h4><p begin="00:14:47.03" data-timestamp="887.03">Well, I mean, she'd just say she's sad. You know, very sad. I wish my mother had been able to live. And been able to be here for me when I needed her. And been able to go shopping with me and all the kinds of things that I think any young woman would love to have her mother do. And you can imagine, that was very difficult for me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:15:12.85" data-timestamp="912.85">Toward the end of her college years, the letters were difficult for Rebecca for another reason. One of her mother's regular theme, actually you could say it was the dominant theme, was religious faith. The Gee's are Mormons and to her mother, staying close to the church was essential.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rebecca</h4><p begin="00:15:29.02" data-timestamp="929.02">The most important thing for her was that I be a Mormon woman in the way that she wanted me to be. Which was a woman that went to the temple. A woman who married a Mormon man. A woman who believed all of the Mormon theology.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:15:44.13" data-timestamp="944.13">By the time Rebecca was a senior in college, she was moving away from the church. So she worried a lot about disappointing her mother, who in the letters was constantly imploring her to stay. Quote, &quot;You must always have the goal of going to the temple. For there you receive great gifts. It is in the temple that we are joined in eternal bonds and powers that will unite us in the world's beyond.&quot;</p><p begin="00:16:06.34" data-timestamp="966.34">In another letter she wrote, &quot;You will make good life choices. I know you will. But no matter your choice, never lose sight of the temple for me, please.&quot;</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rebecca</h4><p begin="00:16:17.23" data-timestamp="977.23">By age 21, after a few years of getting these letters and going through a process where I realized this right not going to be in my life, sometimes I would feel angry. And I remember at age 21 thinking, man, do I have to open up this one this year? This is tough. I don't want to do it. And my friend saying, well, why don't you wait? We'll go out to dinner. Maybe open it up tomorrow. And I felt guilty. And I remember feeling like if I didn't open it up I would really disappoint her. And yet, then I open it up and it's all about, I hope you marry a Mormon man and I hope you go to the temple. And if you don't go to the temple, you won't go to heaven. You're not going to see me. And I'm not doing it. And that's a pretty hard thing to hear on your birthday.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:17:07.78" data-timestamp="1027.78">Gordon was devout, but he could listen to Rebecca's reasons for leaving the church and came to accept them. Her mother couldn't do that. And in the three-way conversation that is part of any relationship of child, mother, and father, the voice of Rebecca's mother always spoke the loudest. It might seem strange that the deceased parent had the most sway, but her mother's opinion was fixed. There's no arguing with her. That haunted Rebecca. And while Gordon found himself reassuring his daughter, the comforts he offered were always trumped by Rebecca's memory of her mother.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gordon Gee</h4><p begin="00:17:40.62" data-timestamp="1060.62">It's difficult to compete with a dead spouse or in this sense, a dead mother. Because I'm here and I have all of the frailties of who I am. And over time, obviously her mother became very iconic. In many ways, very perfect. And clearly, could do no wrong. And I mean I never did say this to her, although I've joked with her a couple times. You know, who am I, chopped liver?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:18:06.66" data-timestamp="1086.66">Because the letters were written exclusively for Rebecca, Gordon thought it was inappropriate to ask too many questions about them. For the same reason, Rebecca never volunteered to share them. Father and daughter were just following a set of instructions. As outdated and as trying as those instructions were.</p><p begin="00:18:22.61" data-timestamp="1102.61">Over the years, as he dealt with his daughter's anguish, Gordon tossed out some hints the perhaps it was a bad idea for him to lob these annual grief bombs into her life.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gordon Gee</h4><p begin="00:18:31.60" data-timestamp="1111.6">I did on several occasions, I just said, you know, you have to remember that your mother was very ill. And that she loved you very much. But I'm not quite certain how healthy this is to have these letters and I said that to her directly. And I've said that to her on several occasions. And because it was very hard on me. It would really break my heart when I would hear her be so sad.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:19:00.14" data-timestamp="1140.14">But Rebecca never seemed to pick up on her father's hints, or his misgivings. As painful as the letters were, she felt as though she had no choice but to read them carefully. So Gordon sent them all, though he was conflicted about it enough that he actually delegated the FedExing part to his secretary.</p><p begin="00:19:15.89" data-timestamp="1155.89">All of this letter related dread culminated with Rebecca's wedding, which happened in 2006 in an Episcopal church. But Rebecca and Gordon suspected the letter Elizabeth wrote for Rebecca's wedding would contain her longest course yet on the importance of marrying in a Mormon temple. Which is why both father and daughter told me they were secretly relieved when the letter, which Gordon's secretary says she sent, vanished in the FedEx system.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rebecca</h4><p begin="00:19:40.04" data-timestamp="1180.04">I remember thinking, if there is one for my wedding, I definitely don't want to open it on my wedding day. Because I really want my wedding day to be happy. And I don't want to sit, I don't want to cry. That day in particular, didn't want the letter to be a part of it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:20:04.84" data-timestamp="1204.84">Because all the birthday letters had been sent, the wedding letter would have been the final letter in the series.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:20:10.25" data-timestamp="1210.25">Was there part of you when the letters ran out that felt relief?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gordon Gee</h4><p begin="00:20:15.01" data-timestamp="1215.01">Yeah, I think so.

And I think it was to her in many ways.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:20:35.75" data-timestamp="1235.75">But it was also a new beginning. For the first time, Rebecca began living a life that wasn't shadowed by a looming reminder of her mother's unmet hopes. Rebecca had become a physician. And she married a doctor named Allan Moore, whom she had met in residency. It was a very happy marriage and it ended tragically, a mere 18 months after it started when the couple was hit by an SUV while riding a Vespa.</p><p begin="00:20:59.57" data-timestamp="1259.57">Rebecca was severely injured and Allan was killed. For the second time in her life, Rebecca was forced to cope with a devastating loss. But this time was different. She spent her months of physical rehab contemplating and writing about her memories of Allan.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rebecca</h4><p begin="00:21:15.69" data-timestamp="1275.69">And I remember thinking to myself, this is how it should be when you grieve for someone. You should remember the beautiful times, the things you shared. You should celebrate that person, but you shouldn't be dragged back into the grave with them every year. Why did she do this to me?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:21:43.44" data-timestamp="1303.44">Rebecca says a year and a half after her husband's death, she feels like she's farther along in her grieving for him than she was 10 years after her mother died.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rebecca</h4><p begin="00:21:51.86" data-timestamp="1311.86">I mourned my husband's loss, Allan's loss. I love him, but I'm moving on with my life as he would want me to.

I can't say that because they made me feel incredibly loved. They made me know how much she valued her time on this earth with me. I got to hear that. I got to hear that after she died.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:22:46.82" data-timestamp="1366.82">Recently, Rebecca has started to grasp the hardships the letters imposed on her dad. And she thinks it would've been better if she had shared the letters with her father in real time, even if that went against her mother's wishes. This surely wasn't Elizabeth's intention, but when she wrote those letter, she left behind the bricks for a wall that kept her husband and her daughter apart, at least when the subject came to Elizabeth. Along with instructions that made discussing that wall very difficult. It was a plan that neither Rebecca nor Gordon ever consented to. And now, very gingerly, the wall is being dismantled.</p><p begin="00:23:20.12" data-timestamp="1400.12">A months ago Rebecca sent her Dad a copy of one of the letters from her 24th birthday. Much of which is about Gordon's strengths as a dad. She has yet to share any of the others. And during our interview, Gordon joked that he was a little jealous that I got to read the letters before he did.</p><p begin="00:23:37.17" data-timestamp="1417.17">But a dying wish has a momentum all its own. And though the letters are now locked in a safe in Gordon's home, he still hasn't looked at them. And Rebecca still hasn't asked him to.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:23:52.84" data-timestamp="1432.84">David Segal is a reporter for the <i>New</i> <i>York</i> <i>Times</i>.</p><p begin="00:23:56.09" data-timestamp="1436.09">[MUSIC- &quot;PAGES OF MY LETTERS&quot; BY KERI NOBLE]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:24:48.02" data-timestamp="1488.02">Coming up, a set of parents like any others trying to impress their values on their child.

And crash.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janice Carter</h4><p begin="00:48:16.47" data-timestamp="2896.47">And we just, we fell asleep.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jad Abumrad</h4><p begin="00:48:18.66" data-timestamp="2898.66">On the ground together.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janice Carter</h4><p begin="00:48:19.39" data-timestamp="2899.39">And when I woke up, Lucy was actually holding my hand. And she had a leaf.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Robert Krulwich</h4><p begin="00:48:29.01" data-timestamp="2909.01">She's holding out a leaf?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janice Carter</h4><p begin="00:48:30.93" data-timestamp="2910.93">Yes. She reached out and she offered it to me. And then I offered it to her. And she ate it. It was a miracle. It was an absolute miracle.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robert Krulwich</h4><p begin="00:48:46.08" data-timestamp="2926.08">And after that says Janice--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janice Carter</h4><p begin="00:48:47.63" data-timestamp="2927.63">She was turned.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charles Siebert</h4><p begin="00:48:48.77" data-timestamp="2928.77">And actually, from that moment on Lucy did start to make the effort and go off?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jad Abumrad</h4><p begin="00:48:55.81" data-timestamp="2935.81">And be a chimp?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charles Siebert</h4><p begin="00:48:56.62" data-timestamp="2936.62">And be a chimp?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jad Abumrad</h4><p begin="00:48:57.55" data-timestamp="2937.55">That's Charles Siebert again.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charles Siebert</h4><p begin="00:48:58.73" data-timestamp="2938.73">And it was not too long after that that Janice went away and--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jad Abumrad</h4><p begin="00:49:03.52" data-timestamp="2943.52">Left the island?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charles Siebert</h4><p begin="00:49:04.34" data-timestamp="2944.34">Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:11.22" data-timestamp="2951.22">Janice says she'd periodically circle in a boat just to keep an eye on Lucy. But she says she never, not once, set foot on that island. At least not for a year. Then one day she decided to go back.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janice Carter</h4><p begin="00:49:29.22" data-timestamp="2969.22">This day is the first day that I went actually on the island.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:33.17" data-timestamp="2973.17">She pulled her boat up to the tip of the island where there's just a little clearing and she parked. And as she did, Lucy and the other chimps who had heard the boat, came out of the forest and into the clearing. And Lucy and her walked toward each other.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janice Carter</h4><p begin="00:49:46.01" data-timestamp="2986.01">And I took with me some of Lucy's possession that had been important to her, like her mirror. And she used to like to draw and books, just to see how she responded to it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:57.60" data-timestamp="2997.6">And what did she do?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janice Carter</h4><p begin="00:49:59.00" data-timestamp="2999">Well she looked at the things. She looked at the book. She looked at herself in the mirror and she signed to herself in the mirror. Then all of a sudden she grabbed me. I mean really grabbed me. One arm circled all the way around me and she sort of held me really, really tight. It really made me breathless and I started crying. She started begin these soft little pants. And I'm still pretty certain what she was saying to me was it's OK. You know, it's all OK now.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jad Abumrad</h4><p begin="00:50:49.93" data-timestamp="3049.93">At that moment, somebody in Janice's boat snapped a picture of her and Lucy hugging. It's a picture that Charles Siebert printed in his book. And it's one of those images that when you see it, I don't know why, it just haunts you.</p><p begin="00:51:04.45" data-timestamp="3064.45">Lucy has their head against Janice's chest and Janice has her arms around Lucy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charles Siebert</h4><p begin="00:51:08.47" data-timestamp="3068.47">It's one of the more fraught moments. You have to just look at the picture. I mean it sort of made me want to write the book. Something about the complexity and the invertedness of that picture.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janice Carter</h4><p begin="00:51:23.15" data-timestamp="3083.15">After that, the other chimps had started to go. And she wanted to go with them. And she got up and she didn't turn back to look at me. She just kept walking. She wanted to go with the other chimps and she did.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jad Abumrad</h4><p begin="00:51:44.25" data-timestamp="3104.25">A year later, Janice went back to visit Lucy again. But when she got there, this time Lucy was gone.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janice Carter</h4><p begin="00:51:52.48" data-timestamp="3112.48">And I went to all the different places looking to see if we could find anything. And we did. We found her body.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jad Abumrad</h4><p begin="00:51:59.53" data-timestamp="3119.53">She was lying right near the place where Janice's cage had been, just a skeleton.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janice Carter</h4><p begin="00:52:06.85" data-timestamp="3126.85">Her skull and her hands and her feet were separated from the rest of her skeleton.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Robert Krulwich</h4><p begin="00:52:15.58" data-timestamp="3135.58">So how did you know that that was her body?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:52:18.99" data-timestamp="3138.99">She had a split between her front teeth and she was very long. And there was nobody else missing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jad Abumrad</h4><p begin="00:52:26.75" data-timestamp="3146.75">And maybe the saddest, strangest thing was that--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janice Carter</h4><p begin="00:52:29.93" data-timestamp="3149.93">We didn't find any signs of her skin or hair.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jad Abumrad</h4><p begin="00:52:34.69" data-timestamp="3154.69">It appeared that Lucy had been skinned.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charles Siebert</h4><p begin="00:52:37.96" data-timestamp="3157.96">And no one knows actually what happened. But because the hands were taken, which poachers do, they thought one of the conjectures which makes it really unbelievably tragic is that they think that Lucy, always the first to approach humans, just sort of guilelessly approached poachers, not knowing that they were that. And that they just took advantage of their unwitting and over eager prey. But that was Lucy's end.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janice Carter</h4><p begin="00:53:07.91" data-timestamp="3187.91">The scenario that I have developed to cope with her death is that a fisherman or someone, some local person that just happened to pull up next to the land and was going to take a break or [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] or do something. And because she always felt confidence around humans, she probably approached the person. Perhaps she surprised the person and just on reflexes, defense, she was probably shot. I've got no other explanation.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:00.60" data-timestamp="3240.6">Janice Carter still lives in Gambia. It's then when she realized that the chimps there would never have a chance to survive unless their human neighbors understood that might be a good thing. So these days she spends a lot of her time teaching people in Gambia about chimps, to convince them about the importance of protecting the chimps habitat.</p><p begin="00:54:16.28" data-timestamp="3256.28">Charles Siebert's latest book, all about the midway point between animals and humans is <i>The</i> <i>Wauchula</i> <i>Woods</i> <i>Accord.</i></p><p begin="00:54:23.46" data-timestamp="3263.46">Radiolab is a production of New York's Public radio station WNYC, distributed around the country by NPR. If you go to the Radiolab website this week, you can see that eerie photo that they talked about with Janice Carter and Lucy embracing.

If you're already not downloading the free podcast of Radiolab that comes out every two weeks, you are missing the most adventurous, enjoyable news show in public radio.

That interview that I did with Dave Hill at the top of today's show about his mom was recorded about three weeks ago. Last week, his mom, Bernadette Hill, though everybody called her Bunny, died at the age of 80. Dave has been on our show and around our office a lot lately. He wrote the song about the Erie Canal in last week's show. And our thoughts are with him and with his family.</p><p begin="00:55:59.16" data-timestamp="3359.16">[ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS]</p><p begin="00:56:50.82" data-timestamp="3410.82"><i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i> is distributed by Public Radio International.
