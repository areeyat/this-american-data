  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.58" data-timestamp="0.58"> So John, you're from Minnesota. Right?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:00:02.27" data-timestamp="2.27"> I am from Minnesota.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:03.52" data-timestamp="3.52"> John Biewen's a public radio guy, makes documentaries. And he says growing up in Minnesota, there was a way that people usually talked about the history of the state.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:00:11.72" data-timestamp="11.72"> And it's often told in a kind of light and self-deprecating way that northern Europeans came over, and they staggered out onto the tundra and said, oh, this reminds us of home. And they didn't know enough to keep going to some more pleasant place. And so they built their sod huts and laid out their farms.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:33.49" data-timestamp="33.49"> Sometimes there's an oh, by the way, Indians were here when we got here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:00:38.34" data-timestamp="38.34"> It's either an afterthought or it doesn't come up at all. And there was always a sense, too, growing up in a place like southern Minnesota, that nothing had ever happened there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:48.97" data-timestamp="48.97"> Which, John points out, is completely weird. Southern Minnesota-- he's learned since he grew up there-- was the location of one of the major wars with the Plains Indians, the US-Dakota War. It happened during the same period as the Civil War.</p><p begin="00:01:01.66" data-timestamp="61.66">More people died in that war than died at Little Big Horn or Wounded Knee. In fact, John's own hometown-- Mankato-- was the site of the largest mass execution in US history of Dakota warriors. 38 of them were hanged by the order of Abraham Lincoln, a little more than 150 years ago, the day after Christmas, 1862.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:01:21.22" data-timestamp="81.22"> And the place where that hanging happened, it's right in the heart of downtown. I would've hung out at the mall not far from there, a few blocks down the street. I would have ridden past that spot on my way to Pizza Hut with my buddies, who knows how many times. And never-- it just never-- I didn't hear about it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:41.89" data-timestamp="101.89"> He says he doesn't remember it being taught in school or being mentioned at all his entire childhood by anybody, even though this war is arguably the biggest event in the state's history. It paved the way for Minnesota to become the place it is today, led directly to all the Dakota being kicked off their own land and expelled from the state under conditions that killed hundreds of them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:02:02.05" data-timestamp="122.05"> And if anybody should have heard about it, it should have been me. My parents worked on the McGovern campaign. They admired Martin Luther King. My dad was a high school English teacher who taught <i>To</i> <i>Kill</i> <i>a</i> <i>Mockingbird.</i> And every Sidney Poitier movie that came on TV, they would sit us down and watch it. And I was raised to have a social-- look, I went on to be a public radio reporter.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:27.29" data-timestamp="147.29"> I was going to say. Really, how did you end up in public broadcasting?</p><p begin="00:02:30.52" data-timestamp="150.52">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:02:32.13" data-timestamp="152.13"> I was raised to be aware of the nation's racial injustices. It's just that they all happened someplace else, not in Minnesota.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:50.80" data-timestamp="170.8"> For the last 17 years, John's lived down south, in North Carolina. And he says that at some point the contrast in how people saw their own history down south really hit him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:03:00.41" data-timestamp="180.41"> Not that people down south are sitting around reminiscing about Stonewall Jackson all day long. I mean, that's really not the case. But there is a general and pervasive understanding in the South that something very big happened in the 1860s that shaped the place right up to the present. And that's what's missing in Minnesota.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:26.52" data-timestamp="206.52"> So a while back John Biewen started traveling around the state with two questions-- first, what exactly happened back in 1862? And, second--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:03:36.08" data-timestamp="216.08"> Why don't we talk about it? Why haven't we internalized this story in Minnesota into our understanding of the place?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:43.92" data-timestamp="223.92"> And so, today, the week after Thanksgiving, we bring you this story of Indians and settlers. I found so many of the details of what John learned to be completely surprising. Maybe you will too. From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> Stay with us.</p><p begin="00:04:05.95" data-timestamp="245.95">So now I turn things over to John Biewen.</p></div>  </div>

  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:04:10.05" data-timestamp="250.05"> In setting out to understand what happened in southern Minnesota in 1862, I called up Gwen Westerman. She agreed to spend a few days with me driving around the state to the spots where it all occurred, so I could tell the story here on the radio.</p><p begin="00:04:24.14" data-timestamp="264.14">We meet up in Mankato. I grew up there but haven't lived there for 30 years. She's lived and taught there for the last 20 years.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gwen Westerman</h4><p begin="00:04:32.12" data-timestamp="272.12"> More people probably know about the town of Mankato than realize it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:04:36.46" data-timestamp="276.46"> That's us, in Gwen's SUV.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gwen Westerman</h4><p begin="00:04:38.60" data-timestamp="278.6"> Because in the television series <i>Little</i> <i>House</i> <i>On</i> <i>The</i> <i>Prairie,</i> the Ingalls family lived in Walnut Grove. And whenever Ma and Pa wanted to get away from the kids, they came to Mankato.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:04:52.47" data-timestamp="292.47"> Gwen's an English professor at Minnesota State University in Mankato and a member of the Dakota tribe. She's in her 50s like me. She grew up in Kansas, part of the Dakota diaspora. A lot of her family was banished from Minnesota after the 1862 war-- not that she's always known that herself.</p><p begin="00:05:11.75" data-timestamp="311.75">See, I grew up in Mankato, a white kid knowing next to nothing about the bloody history that happened beneath my feet. Gwen got a teaching job and moved to Mankato, also knowing nothing about that history. She found out later that some older people in her family did know.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gwen Westerman</h4><p begin="00:05:28.37" data-timestamp="328.37"> Then, when I took the job here at MSU, my father and my uncle would say, well, we'll see how long you last there. But they never did explain why they had questions about whether I would stay here or not.</p><p begin="00:05:48.80" data-timestamp="348.8"></p><p begin="00:05:55.73" data-timestamp="355.73">So, December 26, 1993, I had a friend who worked at the university. She said, there are Indians coming. She was also Indian. She said, there are Indians coming. Let's go see what they're doing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:06:12.71" data-timestamp="372.71"> That's all she said?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gwen Westerman</h4><p begin="00:06:13.51" data-timestamp="373.51"> That's all she said. So I said, OK. She came and picked me up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:06:18.22" data-timestamp="378.22"> Gwen didn't know it, but she and her friend Kimberly were going to see the annual ceremony for the Dakota warriors who were hanged in the town square in 1862.</p><p begin="00:06:27.11" data-timestamp="387.11">They arrived late for the ceremony and stood in the back for the prayers and songs. They still didn't know what the event was about. And then it was over.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gwen Westerman</h4><p begin="00:06:37.07" data-timestamp="397.07"> Kimberly and I got back in the car and she was driving. And she started to pull around the corner of the building. And I don't know if your parents drove fast on back country roads when you were small, up and down the hills.</p><p begin="00:06:54.50" data-timestamp="414.5">We used to love it when my parents would do that because you'd go over the top of the hill and then your stomach would kind of come up. But as we rounded the corner of the building, my stomach came up just like that. And I started to sob.</p><p begin="00:07:14.00" data-timestamp="434">And Kimberly stopped the car and said, what's wrong? What's wrong? And I told her I had no idea what was wrong. It was incredible sadness. I didn't really say anything to anybody about that until a few days later when I called my uncle and explained to him what had happened.</p><p begin="00:07:36.38" data-timestamp="456.38">After I finished my story, he was quiet for a long time. Then he finally said, well, my girl, you're connected to that place. You are physically and spiritually connected to that place.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:07:53.11" data-timestamp="473.11"> Come on.</p><p begin="00:07:54.07" data-timestamp="474.07">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:07:55.70" data-timestamp="475.7">That's crazy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gwen Westerman</h4><p begin="00:07:56.98" data-timestamp="476.98"> Yeah, so I don't-- how do you explain it? I didn't know what had happened here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:08:05.59" data-timestamp="485.59"> After that, she learned all about it-- how the Dakota chief who led the uprising in 1862-- Little Crow-- was the brother of her great-great-great-great-grandmother. Another relative, Mazamani, was killed in the last battle of the war. Now she is so steeped in it, she co-wrote a book about the history of the Dakota people in Minnesota.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gwen Westerman</h4><p begin="00:08:31.94" data-timestamp="511.94"> The sign is faded-- "Historic site to the right."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:08:36.90" data-timestamp="516.9"> On a gravel farm road an hour and a half from Mankato, there's an oddly placed historic marker.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gwen Westerman</h4><p begin="00:08:42.05" data-timestamp="522.05"> Here?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:08:42.45" data-timestamp="522.45"> To find it, you have to pull into somebody's driveway. The yard is sheltered by pine trees.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gwen Westerman</h4><p begin="00:08:48.08" data-timestamp="528.08"> We've driven on to a farm site with a classic, weathered red barn and outbuildings, a small house that looks newer, complete with an American flag and a satellite dish.</p><p begin="00:09:03.80" data-timestamp="543.8">And then, right in the middle of their yard, is a marble monument.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:09:10.54" data-timestamp="550.54"> It's a short obelisk etched with the names of five white settlers who were killed here by Dakota men in August of 1862. This was the incident that started the US-Dakota War. Gwen reads a steel plaque that was put up in the 1960s--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gwen Westerman</h4><p begin="00:09:27.44" data-timestamp="567.44"> The Acton Incident-- on a bright Sunday afternoon, August 17, 1862, for young, Sioux hunters, on a spur-of-the-moment dare, decided to prove their bravery by shooting Robinson Jones.</p><p begin="00:09:42.74" data-timestamp="582.74">Stopping at his cabin, they requested liquor and were refused. Then Jones, followed by the seemingly friendly Indians, went to the neighboring Howard Baker cabin, which stood on this site.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:09:56.36" data-timestamp="596.36"> It's hard for me to picture the story this plaque tells. It says the Dakotas and the white man went to a neighbor's cabin-- right here where the monument is now-- and got into a target-shooting contest. Maybe that's what people did with passing strangers on the frontier in 1862. Then the plaque says the Indians suddenly turned on the whites and shot three men, and two women dead.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gwen Westerman</h4><p begin="00:10:19.70" data-timestamp="619.7"> The Indians fled south to their village, 40 miles away on the Minnesota River. There, they reported what they had done, and the Sioux chiefs decided to wage an all-out war against the white man.</p><p begin="00:10:33.80" data-timestamp="633.8">Thus, the unplanned shooting of five settlers here at Acton triggered the bloody Sioux uprising of 1862. They decided to wage an all-out war against the white man.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:10:47.47" data-timestamp="647.47"> You shook your head at that part.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gwen Westerman</h4><p begin="00:10:49.19" data-timestamp="649.19"> I did. It's as if it were that there was nothing that led up to this. It leaves out so much. But it's a small monument. You can't get everything on there.</p><p begin="00:11:14.81" data-timestamp="674.81">[CAR DOORS SHUTTING]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:11:17.41" data-timestamp="677.41"> To get some of the story that's not on the sign, Gwen and I drive to a small museum. From the outside, it looks like one of those wayside rest buildings. It sits on a highway 15 miles north of Mankato, just outside the town where I went to college, St. Peter.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Leonard</h4><p begin="00:11:33.63" data-timestamp="693.63"> So this is our cleverly called "Intro Room."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:11:38.98" data-timestamp="698.98"> Ben Leonard's tall and lanky. He directs this museum-- The Traverse des Sioux Treaty Site.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Leonard</h4><p begin="00:11:45.12" data-timestamp="705.12"> I've been here since 2004. And, for the record, I'm a 36-year-old white guy from North Carolina.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:11:51.94" data-timestamp="711.94"> Really?</p><p begin="00:11:52.67" data-timestamp="712.67">Our Carolina connection noted, we have the required conversation about college hoops--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Leonard</h4><p begin="00:11:56.86" data-timestamp="716.86"> At a time when Duke basketball--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:11:58.12" data-timestamp="718.12"> Then get down to the reason Gwen and I are here. This museum, with its big, central room of maps and panels, gives the history that led to the 1862 war.</p><p begin="00:12:08.30" data-timestamp="728.3">First, the basics-- the Dakota have lived in Minnesota at least 1,000 years and maybe a lot longer. They vastly outnumbered any Europeans who showed up until the mid-1800s, when white people started flooding in.</p><p begin="00:12:21.97" data-timestamp="741.97">And you can probably guess what happened next, because it happened all across the country. The country's leaders, going back to the founders, talked bluntly about prying land out of Indian hands. I'd never realized just how bluntly until talking to Ben. On the wall of the museum is a blown-up text from a letter I'd never seen. Thomas Jefferson wrote it in 1803.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Leonard</h4><p begin="00:12:43.97" data-timestamp="763.97"> Jefferson basically says, look, we want Indian land. But they're not just going to give it to us. So we have to motivate them to sign treaties. And the way that we do that is going to be to get them into debt.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:12:58.83" data-timestamp="778.83"> All right. How did Jefferson really say that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Leonard</h4><p begin="00:13:02.23" data-timestamp="782.23"> He said it hither-- the quote is here. "To promote the disposition to exchange lands, we shall push our trading houses and be glad to see the good and influential individuals among them run in debt. Because we observe that when these debts get beyond what individuals can pay, they are willing to lop them off by the session of lands." So that's fairly matter-of-fact.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:13:22.29" data-timestamp="802.29"> It's pretty straightforward. That's what he said.</p><p begin="00:13:26.09" data-timestamp="806.09">And that's exactly what happened in the Minnesota territory. By 1851, the Dakota had come to rely on things they got from white traders-- guns, food, horses, kettles, and blankets, and traps. They were deep in debt, at least according to the traders themselves. And they were the ones keeping track. Here's Gwen.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gwen Westerman</h4><p begin="00:13:46.46" data-timestamp="826.46"> And the government calls them in again to say, we'll help you with your debt, if you sell your land.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:13:53.78" data-timestamp="833.78"> Ben, could you sort of sum up what was the deal essentially?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Leonard</h4><p begin="00:13:57.93" data-timestamp="837.93"> If you look at a map of Minnesota today, land-wise we're talking about basically, everything south of Interstate 94. So we're talking essentially about the lower half of Minnesota.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:14:09.22" data-timestamp="849.22"> Plus some pieces of what would become Iowa and South Dakota. In two big treaties, one of them signed very near to the spot where the museum sits, the Dakota people traded away 35 million acres for about $3 million, which was a better price than some other tribes got.</p><p begin="00:14:27.09" data-timestamp="867.09">The treaties set aside a reservation for the Dakota-- 10 miles on either side of the Minnesota River stretching for 150 miles, a skinny strip in the middle of the vast territory the Dakota were giving up.</p><p begin="00:14:40.14" data-timestamp="880.14">They didn't have much choice. They could see what was coming from the east-- a tidal wave of white settlers hungry for farm land, statehood, settlement. The white negotiators didn't have to say it out loud, but one of them did anyway. A guy named Luke Lea reminded the Dakota chiefs that the US government, quote, "could come with 100,000 men and drive you off to the Rocky Mountains."</p><p begin="00:15:03.84" data-timestamp="903.84"></p><p begin="00:15:12.40" data-timestamp="912.4">A leading negotiator for the whites during these treaty deals was a man named Henry Sibley. Nobody was more important in the creation of the state of Minnesota. He'd later become its first governor.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Wingerd</h4><p begin="00:15:23.47" data-timestamp="923.47"> The treaty couldn't have happened without Henry Sibley.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:15:26.80" data-timestamp="926.8"> To learn more about Sibley, I talked to this historian.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Wingerd</h4><p begin="00:15:29.53" data-timestamp="929.53"> I'm Mary Wingerd, and I wrote a book called <i>North</i> <i>Country--</i> <i>The</i> <i>Making</i> <i>of</i> <i>Minnesota.</i></p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:15:35.77" data-timestamp="935.77"> And it's pretty much the definitive history of Minnesota up to and including the US-Dakota War, isn't it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Wingerd</h4><p begin="00:15:43.30" data-timestamp="943.3"> Well, I'm not going to say that. But yes, it is.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:15:47.68" data-timestamp="947.68"> Wingerd says Henry Sibley moved in from Detroit in the 1830s. He was just 23. The American Fur Company gave him a big job overseeing the southern half of what's now Minnesota.</p><p begin="00:15:58.96" data-timestamp="958.96">Sibley had a child with a Dakota woman. He understood the Dakota language. He went before Congress criticizing treaties that, quote, "betrayed and deceived Indians."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Wingerd</h4><p begin="00:16:09.34" data-timestamp="969.34"> And, as a young man, he just relished spending his time with the Dakota. And he would go out and hunt with them and really fostered good relations with them.</p><p begin="00:16:21.68" data-timestamp="981.68">But the fur trade was a dying business. It was, economically, a dying business when he came here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:16:30.87" data-timestamp="990.87"> By this time, the region had been over-hunted. Revenues were down. And everyone, from managers like Sibley to local traders on the frontier, down to the Dakota men who did the actual hunting, was in hock to the fur company, who would advance them money for all the supplies, traps, and guns.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Wingerd</h4><p begin="00:16:48.56" data-timestamp="1008.56"> Even though he may seem to be the big man in Minnesota, he is buried in debt. By 1849, he was really looking around for some other way to make a living. But he couldn't get out of the trade until he could pay his debts.</p><p begin="00:17:07.30" data-timestamp="1027.3">Because of his financial difficulties, he really played the Dakota people false.</p><p begin="00:17:17.01" data-timestamp="1037.01"></p><p begin="00:17:23.42" data-timestamp="1043.42">Sibley wrote to Pierre Chouteau, who held most of Sibley's debt. He boasted to him-- "The Indians are all prepared to make a treaty when we tell them to do so. And such a one as I may dictate. I think I may safely promise you that no treaty can be made without our claims being first secured."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:17:46.62" data-timestamp="1066.62"> Sibley and Chouteau said the Dakota owed them a lot of money. Those are the claims he's talking about. And they saw the treaties as a way to get paid. The way it happened was pretty ugly.</p><p begin="00:17:58.12" data-timestamp="1078.12">Take the treaty signed it Traverse des Sioux. The treaty was copied into the Dakota language for the chiefs to discuss. But their copy left out a key fact-- the government wasn't going to give the Dakota their payment in a lump sum, as the Dakota wanted and expected.</p><p begin="00:18:15.37" data-timestamp="1095.37">Instead, the money would stay in the hands of the government to be doled out in much smaller, annual payments-- not just in gold, but also food and things like farming equipment.</p><p begin="00:18:26.95" data-timestamp="1106.95">The treaty did provide $305,000 in cash right away, most of it so the Dakota could quote-unquote "settle their affairs." After the signing of the treaty, Sibley's allies took the chiefs aside to sign a second document. The chiefs later said they thought it was just another copy of the treaty. But, in fact, they were agreeing to hand over most of that $305,000 to the traders, all but $60,000 to settle their debts.</p><p begin="00:18:56.23" data-timestamp="1136.23">So the traders got their money. Sibley himself walked away with $66,000-- more cash than the Dakota people got.

We've come to the Lower Sioux Agency. This was the federal government's outpost on Dakota land, near Redwood Falls, Minnesota. Sioux was the white man's name for the Dakota.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anthony Morse</h4><p begin="00:20:09.50" data-timestamp="1209.5"> Oh, yeah, my name's Anthony Morris. I'm a ninth generation Lower Sioux Mdewakanton. My family's been here for at least 150 years. We actually have a picture of my seven-times great-grandfather in the museum here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:20:22.29" data-timestamp="1222.29"> Morse is just 26. He wears glasses and a wispy beard. He directs the historic site.</p><p begin="00:20:30.79" data-timestamp="1230.79">The government's two-story stone warehouse is still here, surrounded by open grassland. In 1862, it was stocked with government food shipments for distribution to the Dakota. These were paid out once a year under the terms of the treaty.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anthony Morse</h4><p begin="00:20:46.13" data-timestamp="1246.13"> OK, so in 1862, where they're coming off a bad crop year in 1861, there's a lot of bad feelings that are brewing. They're really waiting for that annuity payment in June. They're waiting for their food and gold.</p><p begin="00:20:58.14" data-timestamp="1258.14">The local area here would really look about like it would right now.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:21:02.28" data-timestamp="1262.28"> The annual federal shipment of gold and food promised in the 1851 treaty did not arrive on schedule in June. July passed and it didn't come. In the decade since the Dakota signed away their land, Minnesota had become a state. The white population exploded from 5,000 in 1850 to more than 170,000.</p><p begin="00:21:26.24" data-timestamp="1286.24">Put another way, in 1850, Indians outnumbered whites in Minnesota 5 to 1. By 1860, it was the other way around.</p><p begin="00:21:39.75" data-timestamp="1299.75">And the Dakota were being squeezed into less and less space. Washington changed the terms of their treaties, took half the reservation back, and forced them to accept the new terms.</p><p begin="00:21:51.20" data-timestamp="1311.2">This didn't go down well. Minnesota's leaders thought that everything would be fine if the Dakota would just give up hunting, which required lots of land, and take up farming. Some did, cut their hair, raised crops.</p><p begin="00:22:05.00" data-timestamp="1325">But, as you'd expect, a lot of Dakota wanted to live as they always had. Dakota man had always been hunters. Farming was seen as women's work. Hemmed in on their skinny reservation, lots of people couldn't feed themselves. By that August, things were desperate.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anthony Morse</h4><p begin="00:22:22.38" data-timestamp="1342.38"> They were allowing their children to eat the unripened fruit off the trees, because they had to eat something. However, this unripened fruit would then make them sick. They would be even worse. And some people would end up dying because of these problems.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:22:35.51" data-timestamp="1355.51"> Meanwhile, the federal agent had food in the warehouse. But he refused to give it out to the Dakota until their full June payment arrived. Dakota men confronted a store-keeper named Andrew Myrick, asking him for help or credit.</p><p begin="00:22:49.73" data-timestamp="1369.73">What do you expect us to feed our families?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anthony Morse</h4><p begin="00:22:52.32" data-timestamp="1372.32"> And he said to let him eat grass. He considered them, basically, like livestock. They were considered animals to him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gwen Westerman</h4><p begin="00:22:58.36" data-timestamp="1378.36"> There are some versions of that story that say Andrew Myrick said, let them eat grass or their own dung.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:23:07.90" data-timestamp="1387.9"> In 200 years, there hadn't been much violence between Indians and whites in Minnesota. But in August of 1862, Dakota country was ready to blow up. Maybe the only question was, where would the spark come from?</p><p begin="00:23:24.80" data-timestamp="1404.8"></p><p begin="00:23:33.96" data-timestamp="1413.96">That brings us back to the part of the story where Gwen and I began, in that farmyard in Acton, where the four young Dakota men killed the five settlers. There are other versions of the story. One comes from a Dakota, who spoke with the four young men, that don't include the Indians asking for liquor or the target-shooting contest.</p><p begin="00:23:54.84" data-timestamp="1434.84">The story ends the same way, though, with five settlers dead.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anthony Morse</h4><p begin="00:23:58.95" data-timestamp="1438.95"> After the Acton massacre, the four boys rode back to the Lower Sioux Agency. That's where their village was located. They went back to their chief and relayed to him what they had done in Acton.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:24:09.72" data-timestamp="1449.72"> This is Anthony Morse again.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anthony Morse</h4><p begin="00:24:11.79" data-timestamp="1451.79"> And so their chief called a meeting with more chiefs and they eventually called a council with all of the chiefs of Lower Sioux at one of Little Crow's houses, I believe.</p><p begin="00:24:20.85" data-timestamp="1460.85">There they had their counsel on what they should do.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:24:24.80" data-timestamp="1464.8"> Little Crow was one of the leaders who signed the 1851 treaty that turned out so badly for the Dakota. When the chiefs and some riled up young men showed up at his house in the middle of the night, Little Crow said the white world would come down hard on all the Dakota, not just the four men who'd been at Acton.</p><p begin="00:24:42.87" data-timestamp="1482.87">A lot of the young warriors said the Dakota should attack first. Enough is enough, let's drive the whites out. But Little Crow wanted no part of that. He'd been to Washington, D.C. In those days the government liked to invite American Indian leaders to the capital to show them how powerful the new white man's country was.</p><p begin="00:25:02.58" data-timestamp="1502.58">Gwen Westerman, my traveling companion, is related to Little Crow. Like I said, her great-great-great-great-grandmother was the chief's sister. She says Little Crow-- whose name in Dakota is Ta Oyate Duta-- was one of many Dakota trying to adjust to the white culture and find a place in it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gwen Westerman</h4><p begin="00:25:21.63" data-timestamp="1521.63"> And, at this time, Ta Oyate Duta was living in a house and farming, trying--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:25:29.70" data-timestamp="1529.7"> And going to church.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gwen Westerman</h4><p begin="00:25:30.18" data-timestamp="1530.18"> --and going to church.

She says this is a crucial point that's often missed when the story of the conflict is told in Minnesota.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Wingerd</h4><p begin="00:28:30.47" data-timestamp="1710.47"> It is a complete myth that all the Dakota people went to war against the United States. So I have a little bit of trouble with calling it a war, actually. I know that that is the preferred terminology now. But they would get the idea that all the Dakota agreed that they were going to go to war the way the United States would go to war.</p><p begin="00:28:54.05" data-timestamp="1734.05">But, in fact, of course, that wasn't the case. It was a faction that went on the offensive.

Our program today for the week after Thanksgiving-- "Little War on the Prairie," the history of settlers and Dakota Indians in Minnesota. John Biewen first put this story together for our show a few years ago, on the 150th anniversary of the so-called Sioux uprising and the war it led to.</p><p begin="00:30:40.71" data-timestamp="1840.71">During that anniversary year a few years back, probably more was said in Minnesota about these events than in the previous 100 years combined-- lots of newspaper articles and broadcasts and talks. Our guide to the story, John Biewen, grew up in Mankato. He now picks up the story where we left off before the break.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:30:57.19" data-timestamp="1857.19"> So the morning after Little Crow's speech, and after the murders at the Acton farm, August 18, 1862, several hundred Dakota warriors, led by Little Crow, started their assault at the federal outpost that sat on their land, the Lower Sioux Agency.</p><p begin="00:31:13.90" data-timestamp="1873.9">They took food from the stone warehouse, burned buildings, and killed about 20 men, one-fourth of the whites at the agency. The dead included the storekeeper who said that if Dakota families were hungry, they could eat grass. Again, Anthony Morse, who runs the agency's history center.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anthony Morse</h4><p begin="00:31:32.98" data-timestamp="1892.98"> Andrew Myrick's body was found. He was more than likely fleeing from his home to the tall grass and the trees. However, he didn't quite make it. And his body was found filled with arrows and with grass stuffed in his mouth.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:31:45.82" data-timestamp="1905.82"> Most of Minnesota's trained soldiers were off at the Civil War. When word of the attacks reached a nearby fort, some green, unprepared soldiers came to help. The Dakota ambushed them, killing almost everyone, and sending the rest fleeing for their lives.</p><p begin="00:32:02.38" data-timestamp="1922.38">From there, the Dakota men fanned out down the river valley, attacking the homes of settlers, most of them unarmed. Joseph Godfrey was a young, black man, who lived among the Dakota. He testified later that fall, telling how Dakota warriors he was with went house to house. This is an actor reading.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Actor</h4><p begin="00:32:22.17" data-timestamp="1942.17"> Dinner was on the table. And the Indians said, "After we kill, then we will have dinner." When we got near to a house, the Indians all got out and ran ahead of the wagons and two or three went to each house. And in that way, they killed all the people along the road.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:32:42.88" data-timestamp="1962.88"> Some Dakota killed every settler they saw. Others killed only the men and took women and children captive. But many Dakota warriors spared and protected white people they knew. Even Chief Little Crow, the leader of the uprising, allowed a white woman named Sarah Wakefield, the wife of a local doctor, to take shelter in his house during the six weeks of the War.</p><p begin="00:33:06.04" data-timestamp="1986.04">One Dakota woman who opposed the fighting, named Snana, took in a 14-year-old German girl who had been captured by a warrior. Snana traded him a pony for the girl. Snana wrote down her story in 1901. Turns out, her daughter had died recently, and she was heartbroken.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Actor</h4><p begin="00:33:24.13" data-timestamp="2004.13"> The reason why I wished to keep this girl was to have her in place of the one I lost. So I loved her and pitied her. And she was dear to me, just the same as my own daughter. During the outbreak, when some of the Indians got killed, they began to kill some of the captives. At such times I always hid my dear captive white girl. I thought to myself that if they would kill my girl, they must kill me first.</p><p begin="00:33:52.49" data-timestamp="2032.49"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:33:57.83" data-timestamp="2037.83"> The historian Mary Wingerd is a fifth-generation Minnesotan. She says for 100 years or more, Minnesotans who heard the story at all heard a one-sided tale of savage Indians attacking innocent whites out of the blue.</p><p begin="00:34:12.78" data-timestamp="2052.78">Now most historians like herself blame the war mainly on white double-dealing and bullying.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Wingerd</h4><p begin="00:34:19.02" data-timestamp="2059.02"> But I also think it's a mistake to try to pretend that there was no wrongs committed by the men who rode against the settlers. A minimum 400 innocent civilians were murdered, most of them who didn't even have weapons-- women and children.</p><p begin="00:34:41.85" data-timestamp="2081.85">The Dakota people were victims, big time. But most of the people who died were victims as well. The people who would have been worthy opponents in a war were untouchable.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:34:55.32" data-timestamp="2095.32"> Meaning the men in St. Paul and Washington, D.C. who wrote, then violated, the treaties. The fighting lasted 36 days. Dakota warriors attacked New Ulm twice and looted and burned a couple other towns.</p><p begin="00:35:10.62" data-timestamp="2110.62">White settlers turned into panicked refugees, fleeing across the prairie. And the man appointed to lead a force to defeat the Dakota? Henry Sibley. You remember Sibley, the fur trader who helped orchestrate the treaties of 1851.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Wingerd</h4><p begin="00:35:28.30" data-timestamp="2128.3"> Well, Sibley has no military experience whatsoever. But he does know the Dakota well. And he knows what great warriors they are. And he has the most hodgepodge troops ever. And he doesn't have enough weaponry.</p><p begin="00:35:48.33" data-timestamp="2148.33">And so he's moving very slowly towards southwestern Minnesota. And, of course, every step of the way, the newspapers are excoriating him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:35:59.62" data-timestamp="2159.62"> They called him a snail and a coward and the state undertaker, because Sibley's militia showed a knack for arriving after battles were over to help bury the dead.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Wingerd</h4><p begin="00:36:10.17" data-timestamp="2170.17"> They accuse him of not really wanting to go after the Dakota, because he's really too close to them and all his sympathies are with them. So Sibley, with his very thin skin, is beside himself.</p><p begin="00:36:28.51" data-timestamp="2188.51">And I think that that helps explain the really extraordinarily severe attitude he had toward all the Dakota people following the conflict I really think it was because he felt he was personally betrayed.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:36:45.69" data-timestamp="2205.69"> Sibley had seen himself as a friend to the Dakota. He believed they could take up farming and co-exist with white people in Minnesota. But now even some Dakota he knew-- men who had started to assimilate-- were murdering settlers.</p><p begin="00:37:00.03" data-timestamp="2220.03">In his letters, Sibley was bitter. Quote, "A great public crime has been committed, not by wild Indians who did not know better, but by men who have had advantages, intercourse with white men."</p><p begin="00:37:13.06" data-timestamp="2233.06">In another he wrote, "Tame the Indian. Cultivate him. Strive to Christianize him as you will. And the sight of blood will, in an instant, call out the savage, wolfish, devilish instincts in his race."</p><p begin="00:37:26.89" data-timestamp="2246.89">Years before all this, Sibley had warned that if the federal government kept cheating Indians in treaties, the result would be war. Now that very thing was happening in his own state. And he himself had helped convinced the Indians to sign those crooked treaties. But there was no indication Sibley took any blame, says Wingerd.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Wingerd</h4><p begin="00:37:47.72" data-timestamp="2267.72"> To me, it's perfectly plausible that he could deny to himself that all the things he did really hurt them. And if only they would accept the route to civilization and become farmers, they would be fine. If only they would do it this way, they would be OK.</p><p begin="00:38:09.73" data-timestamp="2289.73"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:38:15.11" data-timestamp="2295.11"> Altogether in the six-week war, somewhere between 400 and 1,000 white people died, most of them settlers. Not as many Dakota died-- maybe 50 to 100 in the war itself. But payback was still to come.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Actor</h4><p begin="00:38:30.80" data-timestamp="2310.8"> Our course, then, is plain-- the Sioux Indians of Minnesota must be exterminated or driven forever beyond the borders of the state.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:38:38.27" data-timestamp="2318.27"> This is what Minnesota governor Alexander Ramsey said to a special session of the state legislature, during the war in September of 1862.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Actor</h4><p begin="00:38:47.36" data-timestamp="2327.36"> If any shall escape extinction, the wretched remnant must be driven beyond our borders and our frontier garrisoned with a force sufficient to forever prevent their return.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:38:58.57" data-timestamp="2338.57"> It's not surprising that white Minnesotans were enraged by the attacks. But things got extreme. A newspaper columnist named Jane Grey Swisshelm called for a bounty for Sioux scalps. And months later, the state started offering $75 each, and eventually $200.</p><p begin="00:39:17.25" data-timestamp="2357.25">Chief Little Crow and a couple hundred of the most militant warriors had fled west, out of Minnesota. The rest of the Dakota people gathered voluntarily at a makeshift camp on the prairie to wait for Colonel Henry Sibley.</p><p begin="00:39:31.89" data-timestamp="2371.89">Most were women, children, and old men who had not participated in the killing. Here's Gwen again.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gwen Westerman</h4><p begin="00:39:40.23" data-timestamp="2380.23"> There are letters back and forth between Henry Sibley and the leaders on the Dakota side where he specifically said, come out under a flag of truce. You'll be protected. I'll protect you. You have my word.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:39:56.30" data-timestamp="2396.3"> And like some other promises that had been made along the way--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gwen Westerman</h4><p begin="00:40:02.94" data-timestamp="2402.94"> That one was not honored either.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:40:07.02" data-timestamp="2407.02"> The Dakota trusted Sibley's promise that only those who had murdered settlers would be punished. But the 1,700 Dakota civilians were marched 150 miles down the Minnesota River, a mini Trail of Tears.

So Lincoln had his people review the trial transcripts for evidence that the men had attacked settlers, and not just shown up at battles.</p><p begin="00:46:31.10" data-timestamp="2791.1">In the end, Lincoln himself wrote out a list of 39 Dakota names-- later trimmed to 38. The day after Christmas, those men were marched on to a big platform in Mankato's town square. Hoods were pulled over their heads.</p><p begin="00:46:47.65" data-timestamp="2807.65">4,000 people had come from miles around to watch.

And his scalp, skull, and wrist bones were displayed at the Minnesota Historical Society for decades. Mary Wingerd says, for a short time after the war, Minnesotans were triumphant at having beaten back the savage Indians. They relished the story.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Wingerd</h4><p begin="00:47:31.72" data-timestamp="2851.72"> So there's lots of dime novels coming out and panoramas that are created.

Countless Minnesota businesses use native names and imagery-- Land O'Lakes butter, with its Indian maiden on the box. There's a Little Crow country club. For years, the logo of the gas company-- Minnegasco-- was an Indian girl with a blue flame as the feather in her headdress.</p><p begin="00:49:49.29" data-timestamp="2989.29">There are probably other reasons white Minnesotans don't remember the US-Dakota War.

And every moment in history is just as complex as the moment we're living in right now.</p><p begin="00:57:24.41" data-timestamp="3444.41">I have a friend, Tim Tyson, a historian I work with at Duke, who points out that in his home state of North Carolina, up to one third of the white people were pro-Union during the Civil War.

There's no memory that General Pickett, of Pickett's Charge, came to Kinston, North Carolina in 1864. And the first thing he did was he hanged 22 local white boys on the courthouse lawn because they were loyal to the United States government.</p><p begin="00:58:07.25" data-timestamp="3487.25">And you go down to Kinston now and you go out to King's Barbecue and you look down the row of cars, at all those trucks and all those Confederate-flag bumper stickers.

That's kind of interesting.</p><p begin="00:58:29.57" data-timestamp="3509.57">So we invent a fake history for ourselves that doesn't deal with the complexities. And I think that, in some ways, that's what the South and the upper Midwest have in common is that there's a delusion at work about who we were. And that's why we have a hard time about who we are.</p><p begin="00:58:49.43" data-timestamp="3529.43">So that the kind of self-congratulatory history that passes for heritage, it keeps us from seeing ourselves and doing better.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>John Biewen</h4><p begin="00:59:03.47" data-timestamp="3543.47"> One place to see fake history-- on a state flag of Minnesota.
