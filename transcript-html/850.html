  <h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:11.78" data-timestamp="11.78"> This is not a setting where Chris was used to learning anything important, much less having his whole world rocked by something somebody said. He was 15, in health class, in San Juan Capistrano, California. As Chris remembers it, it was the beginning of the period. Class was just beginning to settle down. The teacher was also the school's basketball coach.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:00:30.66" data-timestamp="30.66"> You know, in my memory, he's the standard-issue-- I don't know-- tallish, white guy coach with, like, neatly parted brown hair. And the bell rings. Class is supposed to start. And we're all just talking over him, not listening.</p><p begin="00:00:48.87" data-timestamp="48.87">And he's trying to get class started. And I think he's getting, understandably, a little annoyed. And then at one point, one of the girls said loudly, we're all going to be friends forever.</p><p begin="00:01:03.86" data-timestamp="63.86">And then he gets our attention and said something like, just for your information, you're not going to all stay friends forever. And let me tell you a little bit about how friendships work. He says, in a couple of years, high school is going to end, and you're going to all scatter to different jobs or colleges, and you're going to start falling out of touch with each other, and eventually, you're not going to talk to most of any of these other people. And now, you might--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:38.89" data-timestamp="98.89"> (LAUGHING) Can we just pause? That is such-- it's real. It's very true. But what a funny thing to say to a bunch of kids.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:01:48.44" data-timestamp="108.44"> Yeah. It's like, suddenly, he had our full attention.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:59.94" data-timestamp="119.94"> But then the teacher kept going. He wasn't done. He got very specific and said, OK, you might stay in touch with a few friends from high school.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:02:10.48" data-timestamp="130.48"> He said, like, well, then you're going to get into your 30s and your 40s, and it'll be harder. You'll be working. And then some of you might get married, and your free time-- a lot of that should go towards your spouse. And if you have kids, oh, whatever little free time you have left, that'll go to the kids.</p><p begin="00:02:32.80" data-timestamp="152.8">And finally, he said, the only friends you're going to be left with are the parents of whatever kid your little toddler or whatever randomly sidles up to because they both like the same part of the playground. That person, that parent-- that's going to be your friend.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:52.51" data-timestamp="172.51"> That is a very thorough and vivid and not inaccurate picture of the future, that it's amazing that he went into that much detail.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:03:04.83" data-timestamp="184.83"> Yes. By then, we were like-- I remember a sort of, like, stunned silence at that point. And maybe there's one person who said, like, no, or like, no, he's wrong, or we're going to stay friends, or something. And then the class-- and then the class began, and I don't remember anything else from that day.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:30.15" data-timestamp="210.15"> This is actually one of the producers on our show, Chris Benderev. And he says he remembers the other kids in class, kind of, shrugging this off like, yeah, whatever. But he couldn't.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:39.54" data-timestamp="219.54"> Did you think it was true?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:03:42.21" data-timestamp="222.21"> Absolutely. I thought that he-- I remember thinking, oh, no, I hope that he's wrong, but it sounds like he's right. That's what I remember thinking. It had the air of truth, partly because it was so specific-- the playground detail, especially.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:00.93" data-timestamp="240.93"> Before this moment, Chris hadn't bothered picturing what the future was going to be very much. He had a vague sense that things were going to get better and better. But now, thanks to this random speech by this otherwise forgotten teacher, he realized the future he was facing--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:04:15.94" data-timestamp="255.94"> It's going to get tedious and small and narrow and boring. Because when you're in high school, what is better than hanging out with your friends?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:29.50" data-timestamp="269.5"> Right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:04:29.80" data-timestamp="269.8"> Like, that was the best thing you could do. And so you're going to have less and less of that, and this tiny world where you don't even get to pick your friends. I don't know. That just seemed very sad at the time-- and scary, a little bit.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:45.66" data-timestamp="285.66"> In fact, as senior year approached, as graduation day approached, Chris says that this tiny, two-minute speech by this teacher totally colored how he was seeing it. He loved his friends.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:04:56.05" data-timestamp="296.05"> I was scared of the end of high school in a way that I think most 18-year-olds aren't. It seemed like this was going to be the beginning of the end. And so I became very kind of nostalgic and also fearful, like a doomsday clock or something was running down.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:22.02" data-timestamp="322.02"> Chris actually checked on the health teacher recently. And of course, he had no memory of making that speech, though he said it was exactly the kind of thing that he might have said. And in fact, he did remember saying it at some point to his own kids.</p><p begin="00:05:33.09" data-timestamp="333.09">This teacher said that he would like to believe that he meant it in a kind of nice, "cherish these special times" sort of way, and he was horrified at the thought that this made Chris or any other kid feel bad for the rest of high school. But it just goes to show you how somebody can say something off the cuff that can accidentally turn somebody else's world completely upside down.</p><p begin="00:05:52.95" data-timestamp="352.95">We asked listeners if they ever experienced this, and hundreds responded. Some of the sentences that were said casually to them that later, alone, they obsessed over.</p><p begin="00:06:02.38" data-timestamp="362.38">"It's not your glasses that are uneven. It's your face."</p><p begin="00:06:06.31" data-timestamp="366.31">"You must have been surrounded by some pretty insensitive people growing up."</p><p begin="00:06:10.12" data-timestamp="370.12">"No, no, you're the only circumcised one in the family."</p><p begin="00:06:13.69" data-timestamp="373.69">And one last one, said by a childhood acquaintance at a funeral. "Jenny, little Jenny, you're the one that nobody liked."</p><p begin="00:06:22.81" data-timestamp="382.81">In Chris's case, the teacher's comment obviously stayed with him.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:27.34" data-timestamp="387.34"> How old are you now?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:06:29.50" data-timestamp="389.5"> I am 38.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:32.45" data-timestamp="392.45"> And how many friends from high school are you in touch with?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:06:35.80" data-timestamp="395.8"> I-- a few. A few.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:39.49" data-timestamp="399.49"> Count.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:06:40.30" data-timestamp="400.3"> Three or four. Three or four. And really, only one that I see regularly.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:45.82" data-timestamp="405.82"> So the guy was right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:06:48.07" data-timestamp="408.07"> Yes, he was absolutely right. He-- 100%. [CHUCKLES] He fully predicted my future.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:53.65" data-timestamp="413.65"> These days, Chris is married. One child.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:06:56.65" data-timestamp="416.65"> In fact, my-- the only friends I've made recently are the parents of the other kids who are in my son's daycare.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:07.90" data-timestamp="427.9"> Yeah. And in fact, now that you are married and have children, is your life tedious and narrow and boring?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris Benderev</h4><p begin="00:07:16.57" data-timestamp="436.57"> In some ways, it is. But I like it. I really like it.</p><p begin="00:07:20.81" data-timestamp="440.81">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:07:23.20" data-timestamp="443.2">I obviously like spending time with my kid and my wife. And the people I made friends with that are the parents of the kids randomly assigned to my kid's daycare class-- yeah, they're delightful.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:42.91" data-timestamp="462.91"> Today on our program, "If You Want to Destroy My Sweater, Hold This Thread As I Walk Away."

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:29.09" data-timestamp="509.09"> It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> Act One, The World Has Turned and Left Me Here. So let's kick off this show about people saying things that unravel your picture of the world with this, from Lilly Sullivan.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:08:41.41" data-timestamp="521.41"> In my family, there's a story, the kind your family never forgets. It's about a hitchhiker. It happened decades ago, in 1974. There were three women in the car-- my aunt Manuelita, her daughter, and their cousin. Manuelita was driving.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Manuelita</h4><p begin="00:08:57.61" data-timestamp="537.61"> And I was going in my car. And then here, I saw him hitchhiking like this.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:09:03.38" data-timestamp="543.38"> Holding his finger in the air.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Manuelita</h4><p begin="00:09:04.68" data-timestamp="544.68"> Uh-huh.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:09:05.53" data-timestamp="545.53"> Manuelita is now 96, and her daughter in the car, Anita, remembers more of the details. So I'm going to let Anita tell a lot of this. She was a kid at the time, 10 years old.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anita</h4><p begin="00:09:15.77" data-timestamp="555.77"> For me, it was such a shocking event. It permeated every cell of my being, meaning, like, I just remember it all very clearly. We were in the car. My mother was driving, and she was always impeccably dressed if she was going out.</p><p begin="00:09:34.15" data-timestamp="574.15">And, um, it was raining that day. My mother exited the freeway, and she spotted this young man hitchhiking. He was tall and lanky, and he had long, blonde, dirty blonde hair-- well, because it was wet. It was raining, you know.</p><p begin="00:09:52.88" data-timestamp="592.88">And his beard was just, like, down to his chest. And he had his shirt inside out and misbuttoned. And she said, oh, he has such kind eyes. And I was like, no, he doesn't. You can't see his eyes. It's raining.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Manuelita</h4><p begin="00:10:09.17" data-timestamp="609.17"> And she said, no! I was not afraid of him.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:10:13.91" data-timestamp="613.91"> But she was.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Manuelita</h4><p begin="00:10:15.56" data-timestamp="615.56"> Yeah. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:10:17.90" data-timestamp="617.9"> Anita was scared because they were in Northern California, and there were serial killers-- a few of them-- around there in the '70s. Even at 10, Anita knew this. All three women in the car were small, all under five feet. Anita in the front seat, their cousin Cecilia in the back. Again, here's Anita.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anita</h4><p begin="00:10:36.66" data-timestamp="636.66"> And then, of course, I was protesting loudly. Don't stop the car! And Cecilia even said, no, Manuelita, don't do it. Don't do it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:10:45.90" data-timestamp="645.9"> Manuelita stopped anyway. The man came to the window.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anita</h4><p begin="00:10:48.96" data-timestamp="648.96"> And he had to talk through the passenger side window, where I was sitting and kind of, like, freaking out that he was in my face now.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:10:57.45" data-timestamp="657.45"> Anita remembers sitting stock still, staring straight ahead, afraid to make eye contact as a stranger somehow talked them into letting him into the car.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anita</h4><p begin="00:11:06.21" data-timestamp="666.21"> And my mother didn't speak very good English. Neither did Cecelia. But guess who did speak Spanish?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:11:14.18" data-timestamp="674.18"> Serial killer-looking white guy? Turns out, fluent in Spanish. The hitchhiker lumbered into the back seat next to Cecilia. Cecilia had only been in the country a few weeks at that point and was like, what on earth? She was 26.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anita</h4><p begin="00:11:30.74" data-timestamp="690.74"> And Cecilia-- she was all dressed prim and proper, and she even had little white gloves on. And he had a booming personality to match a booming voice. He had a great voice.</p><p begin="00:11:47.03" data-timestamp="707.03">He got in the car, and everybody calmed down when we heard him speak to Cecilia so kindly, and my mother introduced them. And she pointed out that she had just come.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:11:59.57" data-timestamp="719.57"> Cecilia had just come to the US from Peru. And this is how the story started.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anita</h4><p begin="00:12:04.77" data-timestamp="724.77"> Their life changed. Our lives changed. It was like a meteor hitting the earth when we met Brian.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:12:11.97" data-timestamp="731.97"> Brian-- that was the hitchhiker's name, which I know because that guy's my dad. Cecilia-- that's my mom. And this story-- it's the story of how our family came to be, their legendary first meeting.</p><p begin="00:12:32.11" data-timestamp="752.11">It was followed by a similarly legendary first date. My mom's sister and cousin dressed her up in their own clothes-- white bell bottoms, white platform heels. My dad showed up in a poncho, and he took her hiking in the redwood forest, where it rained.</p><p begin="00:12:51.32" data-timestamp="771.32">He ended up carrying her so that she wouldn't ruin the shoes she'd borrowed. Two weeks later, they eloped, headed off to Reno, but ended up stopping in a random town nearby, where marriage licenses were $5 cheaper. They got married at 7:00 AM on Christmas Eve. Anita remembers them coming home after with their marriage license.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anita</h4><p begin="00:13:12.05" data-timestamp="792.05"> I can remember even the knock on the door. And I ran to open it, and there they were, standing there. I yelled to my mom that they were here, and she came running.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:13:24.14" data-timestamp="804.14"> Her mom, Manuelita.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anita</h4><p begin="00:13:25.77" data-timestamp="805.77"> She welcomed them in, and I don't know what happened next, but they came back married. And they loved each other until the end.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:13:33.42" data-timestamp="813.42"> Wow. Yeah. That's so cool. It's like, it's such a good story.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:13:37.83" data-timestamp="817.83"> Like I said, legendary. This story is the bedrock foundation of how I see my parents, especially my dad. I picture him at 26, his misbuttoned shirt, catching rides through the West Coast alone.</p><p begin="00:13:51.43" data-timestamp="831.43">This big white guy from Detroit climbing into this car full of immigrants, just exuberant and thinking, wow, I'm going to marry this lady. And a picture of my mom at 26, having just arrived in the country, self-contained, determined, seeing this weirdo and deciding, yes. Him.</p><p begin="00:14:14.91" data-timestamp="854.91">When you enter the family, this is pretty much the one story we make you memorize. And then you could be a citizen of the family. Here's my brother-in-law, Lars.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:14:23.29" data-timestamp="863.29"> How many times do you think you've heard this story?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lars</h4><p begin="00:14:25.15" data-timestamp="865.15"> Oh, I don't know. Many times. 50, 100. [CHUCKLES] Many times.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:14:30.54" data-timestamp="870.54"> And the meaning of this story has always been clear.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Karl</h4><p begin="00:14:33.91" data-timestamp="873.91"> If they didn't pick him up, we would-- all of us wouldn't be here right now.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:14:39.24" data-timestamp="879.24"> Here I am with my niece and nephews.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:14:41.05" data-timestamp="881.05"> I wouldn't be here, and you wouldn't be here. Your mom wouldn't be here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Karl</h4><p begin="00:14:45.81" data-timestamp="885.81"> And Sammy wouldn't be here.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:14:47.98" data-timestamp="887.98"> Sammy wouldn't be here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Karl</h4><p begin="00:14:49.24" data-timestamp="889.24"> Tia Nena wouldn't be here. Marian wouldn't be here. Wally wouldn't be here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sammy</h4><p begin="00:14:53.49" data-timestamp="893.49"> Anyone that we know wouldn't be here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cece</h4><p begin="00:14:55.69" data-timestamp="895.69"> Wait, no!</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:14:56.43" data-timestamp="896.43"> Well, we wouldn't be here to know them.</p><p begin="00:14:58.37" data-timestamp="898.37">[KARL LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:14:58.72" data-timestamp="898.72">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:15:01.10" data-timestamp="901.1"></p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:15:04.92" data-timestamp="904.92"> There's something predestined about it. This is such an important story, I thought. You know what? I want to visit the spot where the meteor struck.</p><p begin="00:15:14.22" data-timestamp="914.22">My dad died 10 years ago. I miss him, always. And he doesn't have a grave. He insisted on cremation by, quote, "the cheapest means possible."</p><p begin="00:15:25.74" data-timestamp="925.74">He didn't like fancy things. And I also think that he didn't want to be a burden. Anyway, what I want to remember him was not, like, a location I can go to. I can't, like, put flowers by a tombstone. So how about this place? This legendary spot where he climbed into a car and our family began. So, can't be hard. So where was it?</p><p begin="00:15:51.15" data-timestamp="951.15">Anita says it was by the freeway exit by our house. Manuelita says it was an onramp heading downtown. But they're not definitive about it. So I went to the third person in the car that day, my mom. And she says, sure, I know exactly where it was. And then she starts to tell me this story.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cecilia</h4><p begin="00:16:10.41" data-timestamp="970.41"> I remember.

And she told me that during the time they were separated, one day, she was driving down the street, and she saw my dad was walking.

Cool joke, huh?</p><p begin="00:34:35.84" data-timestamp="2075.84">So she stopped, picked him up. A couple of days later, they got back together. That's the important story, she said. After that, my parents stayed married another 20 years.</p><p begin="00:34:50.06" data-timestamp="2090.06">During that time, they had a blast together, sometimes inseparable. The best time of their marriage, my mom tells me, after they returned to that root moment where everything started. Only this time, it wasn't random chance.

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:36:06.66" data-timestamp="2166.66"> It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Today's program-- "If You Want to Destroy My Sweater, Hold This Thread As I Walk Away." We have stories about small moments between people that suddenly change how everything looks. We've arrived at Act Two of our program. Act Two, What's With These Homies Dissing My Girl?</p><p begin="00:36:23.04" data-timestamp="2183.04">In his early 20s, Mike Comite wanted to be a professional musician. He was trying his absolute hardest to make that happen, until one day, it all came undone-- weirdly, right in front of Weezer. Mike tells what happened.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Mike Comite</h4><p begin="00:36:36.99" data-timestamp="2196.99"> There's this video. I've watched it more times than I'd like to admit in the last decade and a half, kind of like a retired football player watching old game tapes from his glory days, who pauses and rewinds that one play where he tore his ACL over and over to see where his career went sideways. It happened at Bonnaroo, this music festival with some of the biggest acts in the world.</p><p begin="00:36:57.06" data-timestamp="2217.06">That year, Dave Matthews Band and Jay-Z were playing. It was 2010. The band I was in was invited to play on one of the medium-sized stages, which was a huge deal for us. There'd be over 2,000 people watching. It'd be the biggest stage we'd ever played on.</p><p begin="00:37:11.52" data-timestamp="2231.52">But then, I saw that Weezer was also playing Bonnaroo. It felt like some kind of fated opportunity. We were actually covering a Weezer song in our set, and so I had this big idea.</p><p begin="00:37:23.07" data-timestamp="2243.07">Our front person, Julia, was a musician who had blown up on YouTube. She had thousands of followers on social media. What if we got them all to tweet at Weezer's lead singer, Rivers Cuomo, to see if he'd come sing with us? I asked Julia, and she was game for it, and shockingly, it worked, better than we could have hoped.</p><p begin="00:37:41.88" data-timestamp="2261.88">Rivers didn't come sing with us. Instead, he invited Julia to come play her ukulele and sing with Weezer during one of their songs on the main stage. Julia's visibility at Bonnaroo would be multiplied tenfold. If this went well, who knows where it could lead? Maybe Weezer would bring us on tour with them as their opener.</p><p begin="00:38:01.78" data-timestamp="2281.78">Our agent immediately submitted us to their team for some of their upcoming shows. Or maybe Rivers would write a song with Julia, play on our record, or she'd play on theirs. The possibilities kept me up at night.</p><p begin="00:38:12.57" data-timestamp="2292.57">I was 22. I'd only been playing music professionally for a year at that point. But I was convinced this would be the moment that would transform our careers. The day of the show, Julia split off from our group to rehearse with Weezer on their tour bus. I felt a little sting finding out I wasn't going to meet them, too.</p><p begin="00:38:36.90" data-timestamp="2316.9">Weezer went on a little before sunset. Me and the rest of the band sat way back in the crowd on some bleachers, while Julia was somewhere backstage. There had to be at least 20,000 people between us and Weezer.</p><p begin="00:38:48.81" data-timestamp="2328.81">I couldn't believe that a dumb idea I'd cooked up in rehearsal had led to this. The song Julia was going to play on was called "Tripping Down the Freeway." Weezer started it a few songs into their set.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rivers Cuomo</h4><p begin="00:38:59.17" data-timestamp="2339.17"> Here's a new song called, "Tripping Down the Freeway."</p><p begin="00:39:02.73" data-timestamp="2342.73">[CROWD CHEERING]</p><p begin="00:39:05.04" data-timestamp="2345.04"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Mike Comite</h4><p begin="00:39:06.00" data-timestamp="2346"> Julia is off stage for the first half of the song.

Weezer is still on stage, having a conversation mid-song about Julia's tuning through the PA system. Rivers pivots.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rivers Cuomo</h4><p begin="00:39:55.08" data-timestamp="2395.08"> All right. I'm going to tell a little story while you tune your ukulele.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Mike Comite</h4><p begin="00:39:58.57" data-timestamp="2398.57"> He turns to the crowd and starts talking about how Julia had ended up on stage with him that day, about Twitter, about Julia's fans.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rivers Cuomo</h4><p begin="00:40:05.53" data-timestamp="2405.53"> They started to hit me up, saying, hey, dawwwg, Julia's an amazing singer and ukuleleist. Most of the time, she even knows what key the song is in, so why don't you guys have her up?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Mike Comite</h4><p begin="00:40:20.44" data-timestamp="2420.44"> He's making fun of her? I start clenching my jaw from the stands.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rivers Cuomo</h4><p begin="00:40:24.71" data-timestamp="2424.71"> I said, I don't know, man! This is Weezer. This is a professional act. We demand perfection. And Julia's fans said, trust us, dawg. Julia's the bomb!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Mike Comite</h4><p begin="00:40:40.60" data-timestamp="2440.6"> I'm mortified. I can't believe how mean he's being to her. Just so passive-aggressive. At this point, our crew member who's been sitting next to me, excitedly filming Julia's big moment, quietly stops recording and puts down her camera. This isn't her video. Someone else posted this one on YouTube.</p><p begin="00:40:58.09" data-timestamp="2458.09">I couldn't help thinking, I'd been the one to suggest she do this in the first place. This was on me. After an excruciating 62 seconds of improv, Rivers wanders across the stage to where Julia is trying to retune with another band member.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rivers Cuomo</h4><p begin="00:41:11.78" data-timestamp="2471.78"> So, uh, we could just have you sing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Nunes</h4><p begin="00:41:16.02" data-timestamp="2476.02"> I'm just going to sing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Mike Comite</h4><p begin="00:41:17.27" data-timestamp="2477.27"> I'm just going to sing, she says.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rivers Cuomo</h4><p begin="00:41:19.02" data-timestamp="2479.02"> All right.

(SINGING) No way. We ain't going to break up. We made a promise, and our will won't fade out.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Mike Comite</h4><p begin="00:41:41.07" data-timestamp="2501.07"> Julia looks so small from where we're sitting. But I can tell she's holding her ukulele by her side as she sings. They finish the song. Rivers thanks Julia, and she walks off the stage. I'm sitting in the bleachers, shocked by what just happened. Weezer keeps playing a bunch of my favorite songs, and I can't enjoy them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rivers Cuomo</h4><p begin="00:41:59.60" data-timestamp="2519.6"> Give me the guitar, my man.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Mike Comite</h4><p begin="00:42:04.34" data-timestamp="2524.34"> The next day, Rivers tweeted at Julia and thanked her for playing despite the mishap. A few weeks later, Weezer's manager officially turned us down for the opening spot on tour.</p><p begin="00:42:23.38" data-timestamp="2543.38">In the music business, you need some moment to pull you out of obscurity and propel you forward. And it felt like, for us, Weezer had been it. Instead, we'd blown it. And that was the beginning of the end.</p><p begin="00:42:35.08" data-timestamp="2555.08">After Bonnaroo, Julia and I stayed busy touring, just the two of us, for a while. But then things slowed down. Julia and her management were about to part ways. I started getting nervous about being able to support myself, so I tapped out of touring with Julia and got a full-time job where a lot of struggling musicians and actors end up-- at the Apple Store.</p><p begin="00:42:54.13" data-timestamp="2574.13">And so this is when I started watching and rewatching that video, the Weezer performance. I've been doing that for the last 14 years. Each replay, I keep hoping that it won't be as bad as I remember, but it always is. I'm still stuck on, what the fuck happened? And in particular, was it our fault?</p><p begin="00:43:15.35" data-timestamp="2595.35">On stage, Rivers had made it seem like it. But I've gone through the details again and again. Julia had received tuning instructions from Weezer's road manager. Were those incorrect?</p><p begin="00:43:26.33" data-timestamp="2606.33">Had Julia done the math wrong tuning her uke? Had I? I'd helped her with that. I found a video of Julia rehearsing with Weezer on their tour bus. She was in the wrong tuning there, too, but no one had noticed?</p><p begin="00:43:40.73" data-timestamp="2620.73">Julia might know what went wrong, but I never really talked to her about that show. Only once, right after. It was uncomfortable. She was clearly upset, had been crying. She asked to let it go, so I did. But she must remember something from that day. So I called her.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Mike Comite</h4><p begin="00:43:58.40" data-timestamp="2638.4"> When is the last time you thought about the Weezer performance?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Nunes</h4><p begin="00:44:03.08" data-timestamp="2643.08"> It doesn't, like, revisit me in the quiet, dark night.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Mike Comite</h4><p begin="00:44:07.56" data-timestamp="2647.56"> OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Nunes</h4><p begin="00:44:08.12" data-timestamp="2648.12"> I think, when Weezer comes up, like if Weezer is on at a party, I might or might not be like, I've played with Weezer once, and I totally-- [LAUGHS] fumbled.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Mike Comite</h4><p begin="00:44:25.43" data-timestamp="2665.43"> Julia lives in Austin, Texas now. She's still releasing music, but her career has shifted more towards life coaching and guided meditation. Her memories of the Weezer incident were not as vivid as mine.</p><p begin="00:44:36.45" data-timestamp="2676.45">She didn't remember how she and Weezer got in touch. She didn't remember what year it happened. She definitely did not have the email from the road manager about the tuning, and she never puzzled over why her tuning was off. Because for her, that whole show was a totally different experience. When Rivers was saying all that stuff about her on stage--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Nunes</h4><p begin="00:44:54.06" data-timestamp="2694.06"> It never registered to me as, like, anything-- anything other than a musician just trying to make the show go.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Mike Comite</h4><p begin="00:45:01.43" data-timestamp="2701.43"> Oh, my god, I feel like I've just been stewing in it for so long, being like, that dude was an asshole to my friend.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Nunes</h4><p begin="00:45:10.71" data-timestamp="2710.71"> Oh, Mike! No way, man. I have never once thought that Rivers was mean. I didn't know what to say in that moment. I didn't know what to do. Like, he could have just been like, OK, never mind.</p><p begin="00:45:23.79" data-timestamp="2723.79">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:45:25.13" data-timestamp="2725.13">But the fact that he came up with a real-time solution to be like, yeah, just sing-- I was so grateful.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Mike Comite</h4><p begin="00:45:34.20" data-timestamp="2734.2"> I watch this video probably more often than I should. [CHUCKLES] I feel like I'm responsible for it in a way that's like, if I had just not said anything in that rehearsal that day, we could have just gone about our days and rehearsed and then just had our set at Bonnaroo. And then you would have come to the Weezer set and sat in the bleachers with us, and we just would have enjoyed Weezer together.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Nunes</h4><p begin="00:46:00.00" data-timestamp="2760"> [GASPS] Mike, don't you dare.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Mike Comite</h4><p begin="00:46:03.09" data-timestamp="2763.09"> But instead, you went on stage with him, and this thing that could have changed your career, in my view, had this effect that, you seemed so sad afterwards and devastated. And I was like, oh, my god, if I had just said nothing, this wouldn't have happened to you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Nunes</h4><p begin="00:46:19.61" data-timestamp="2779.61"> God, I-- I don't think that experience had any sort of detrimental pivot for my career. The thing that made my career not happen is that I couldn't take the pressure. It's not that you-- I think that you offering that Weezer thing was brilliant. I wish I would have done a bunch of different things, but not playing with Weezer and not fucking up on stage is not one of my regrets at all.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Mike Comite</h4><p begin="00:46:55.92" data-timestamp="2815.92"> [CHUCKLES] I'm glad.

She thought opening for Weezer was a long shot, even if she had been in the right tuning for "Tripping Down the Freeway."</p><p begin="00:47:21.60" data-timestamp="2841.6">But also, the moment Julia remembered most from that performance wasn't the mistake. It was the part of the video that I usually skip over, the moment where it works out, after Rivers asked Julia if she wants to sing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Nunes</h4><p begin="00:47:33.00" data-timestamp="2853"> I'm looking Rivers Cuomo in the eye. Once we decide to start singing, everyone cheers. And we start, like, dancing together, and we put our arms around each other, and we're, like, head to head, singing, like, full blast, "Tripping Down the Freeway." And I felt like we sounded really good together. Yeah, I don't know. Like, all of that feels important to me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Mike Comite</h4><p begin="00:48:05.46" data-timestamp="2885.46"> You can't see any of this in the video I'd been replaying all these years. That one was shot from way back near the bleachers, where I watched the show. I almost couldn't believe what Julia described. But changing up the wording of my YouTube search, I found another video from that day, filmed close to the stage.</p><p begin="00:48:23.10" data-timestamp="2903.1">You can see everyone's faces, and even when the tuning mistake becomes apparent, they're smiling and they're laughing. Julia and Rivers dance. They're having a great time.</p><p begin="00:48:33.27" data-timestamp="2913.27">Watching it, I felt this wave of relief. It's what I was missing all these years. Julia was OK, and I believed her that the band didn't break up because of a tuning mistake. And this moment wasn't why I stopped playing music for a living.</p><p begin="00:48:49.62" data-timestamp="2929.62">After Julia and I talked, I finally heard back from Weezer's former road manager. She found the email they'd sent us before the performance, and the instructions were wrong. There would have been no way for Julia and me to tune correctly with them. I had the full answer now, but I was surprised by how little it mattered to me. I was over it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:17.04" data-timestamp="2957.04"> Mike Comite. He is one of the super skilled people who work here at the show, doing audio mixes and adding music to our stories. Diane Wu produced this story.

  <h3>Act Three: And If You See Her, Tell Her It’s Over Now</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:51:13.87" data-timestamp="3073.87"> Act Three, And If You See Her, Tell Her It's Over Now. In this last act, we turn from small, personal moments to big news that the whole world experiences, but that hits some people very, very personally. You probably saw the headlines and reports that a couple of weeks ago, after his family ruled Syria for over 50 years, the president/dictator Bashar Al Assad, was run out of his own country very suddenly.</p><p begin="00:51:35.35" data-timestamp="3095.35">Assad ran a government that did not tolerate dissent. He used chemical weapons against his own citizens. He spent much of the last 13 years brutally crushing an uprising. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians were killed, tortured, disappeared.</p><p begin="00:51:46.52" data-timestamp="3106.52">More than half the population was displaced in that conflict. Six million Syrians fled the country. So when a rebel coalition forced Assad out two weeks ago, Syrians all over the globe had their world turned upside down, and a few of us here at the show called around to see what that's been like for them. Diane Wu put together this story.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:52:05.47" data-timestamp="3125.47"> The regime collapsed late on a Saturday night. My coworkers and I talked to a few Syrians who are living abroad now about what that night was like for them. One was up studying for an exam. Another was out to an anniversary dinner. He kept checking his phone.</p><p begin="00:52:20.47" data-timestamp="3140.47">But the person I want to tell you about is Salma. She was in London on Saturday. She lives in another part of England. But watching the news by herself in the days before that, she felt like she had to be around other Syrians. So she got on the train and headed to her friend's apartment. She'd been crashing there since Thursday.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Salma</h4><p begin="00:52:37.01" data-timestamp="3157.01"> It's like this tiny one-- it's not even an apartment. It's like a studio. So it's this tiny, tiny studio. We're all sitting together on this couch, five of us, and we're all, like, on our phones. And then the TV's on, and we're all checking, and there's barely any space. I don't know if I would describe it as crashing, because we didn't sleep. So--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:52:58.42" data-timestamp="3178.42"> (LAUGHING) OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Salma</h4><p begin="00:52:59.30" data-timestamp="3179.3"> (LAUGHING) --none of us were sleeping, actually. It felt like we were on duty for some reason, like we were on call constantly.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:53:08.20" data-timestamp="3188.2"> It felt like their job to not look away. Something huge was happening back home. The rebels kept taking more and more ground each day, liberating more and more cities with hardly any pushback. Everyone was worried that Assad would do something desperate, like retaliate with chemical weapons or bombings, or that Russia would jump in. Salma and her friends were barely keeping it together.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Salma</h4><p begin="00:53:29.44" data-timestamp="3209.44"> One of them-- it's not funny, but he kept fainting. And so-- [LAUGHS] he would go into the room, and then just, like, almost pass out. So the first thing I did was-- I didn't know what to do, so I gave him a tomato with salt on it, and I just shoved it into his mouth.</p><p begin="00:53:43.41" data-timestamp="3223.41">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:53:44.81" data-timestamp="3224.81">And I was like, OK, I think your blood pressure is dropping. And--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:53:49.03" data-timestamp="3229.03"> And were you guys like-- were you worried or freaked out, or was he kind of like, oh, this is something that happens?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Salma</h4><p begin="00:53:56.02" data-timestamp="3236.02"> We were-- I don't think we were super freaked out, just because a lot of us have medical training. [CHUCKLES]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:54:02.78" data-timestamp="3242.78"> (LAUGHING) OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Salma</h4><p begin="00:54:03.97" data-timestamp="3243.97"> It wasn't that big of a deal. And so--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:54:05.95" data-timestamp="3245.95"> That's handy. [LAUGHS] OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Salma</h4><p begin="00:54:07.45" data-timestamp="3247.45"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:54:08.38" data-timestamp="3248.38"> They notice there is a pattern to his fainting. First, he'd start sweating profusely, then go stand in the door to cool off, then head towards the bathroom.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Salma</h4><p begin="00:54:17.89" data-timestamp="3257.89"> By the third time, we kind of got the routine down. Like, we saw him open the door. We're like, he's about to pass out. Like, someone start, you know-- [LAUGHS] doing all the steps.</p><p begin="00:54:27.86" data-timestamp="3267.86">We kept joking. They're like, we have to-- you can't pass out now. You got to be strong. You got to make it until the regime falls.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:54:35.81" data-timestamp="3275.81"> Salma told me that her friend who kept fainting had been detained by the regime when he was a teenager, three times. He fled Syria after the third time, but his parents are still there, and he was really concerned about them. Other people in the room were also having physical reactions from all the stress and fear.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Salma</h4><p begin="00:54:53.12" data-timestamp="3293.12"> I think it was just, like, our bodies going into shock, and each person was kind of doing it differently. Like, for me, I cry a lot, and I have panic attacks, and then I throw up, which is kind of gross. But that's what would happen to me. Like, I would get really nauseous, really nauseous, really nauseous. Like, I would go and throw up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:55:10.74" data-timestamp="3310.74"> It was from inside this crowded apartment, scattered with takeout containers and nervous bodies, that these friends then witnessed a sudden unraveling that none of them had anticipated. Salma is from Damascus, the capital, which was the seat of the Assad regime.</p><p begin="00:55:25.95" data-timestamp="3325.95">And as the rebels kept advancing across Syria, taking Hama, and then As-Suwayda, and then Homs, her friends from those cities celebrated around her. If the rebels succeeded, her hometown would be the last to fall. When Salma saw a video of people standing on a tank in Umayyad Square in Damascus, singing "Jannah Jannah," a revolutionary song, it was finally real to her. It was over.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Salma</h4><p begin="00:55:50.52" data-timestamp="3350.52"> Knowing that we would be the last, I was holding it in. And so the first thing I did was, I cried, I hugged all my friends, I-- I sat there kind of staring at the wall, crying, crying, crying, crying.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:56:05.16" data-timestamp="3365.16"> They stayed up all night, and then celebrated more the next day in Trafalgar Square. Then Salma went home and mostly laid in bed in the dark for a few days, trying to make sense of this brand-new world. Salma's family had left Damascus in the first year of the war, 2011, when she was 15.</p><p begin="00:56:23.58" data-timestamp="3383.58">They moved to Connecticut, where she joined the soccer team and tried to do regular life while going to protests against the regime on weekends. Now, she had to figure out how to reverse this thing she's been doing since she was a teenager, separating herself from Syria.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Salma</h4><p begin="00:56:38.27" data-timestamp="3398.27"> I knew I couldn't go back, with the regime there. And so I started slowly distancing myself from my memories. Like, before, I would post a lot of photos, saying, I miss Damascus, or I miss this, or I miss my house, and I miss that. And I stopped doing that, kind of on purpose. And even between myself when I'm alone, if I would remember something or if I would find myself kind of daydreaming, I would stop myself, and I wouldn't let myself go through with it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:57:09.65" data-timestamp="3429.65"> What kind of daydream?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Salma</h4><p begin="00:57:12.32" data-timestamp="3432.32"> Like, sometimes, I would daydream about my house and, like-- (CRYING) sorry.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:57:19.85" data-timestamp="3439.85"> It's OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Salma</h4><p begin="00:57:22.76" data-timestamp="3442.76"> Yeah, I don't know. Like, it's the place where I have a lot of good memories, and-- and it's the place where me and my siblings did this and did that. And sometimes, I would just daydream about walking into my room and going back and sitting in my living room and looking out the window. And I just-- I wouldn't let myself do that anymore. And even at times where I would have dreams about being in my house again, I would wake myself up and be like, no, this isn't real.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:57:52.49" data-timestamp="3472.49"> Someone else I talked to described it like this. Syria was on a different planet from the one he lived on now. There was no way to visit it. He had to flip a page, start a new life. Better not to think about it anymore.</p><p begin="00:58:06.02" data-timestamp="3486.02">But now that the regime was suddenly gone, Syria was back on this planet, a place like any other place. And they had to reset their minds to take that in, which was hard to do after so many years of doing the opposite. Salma started thinking about visiting home, not just in a dream way, but the logistics of where she would stay when she went back.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Salma</h4><p begin="00:58:26.39" data-timestamp="3506.39"> So we still have our house now. I'm like, would I stay at my house, or would I want to stay somewhere else? Or what am I going to do? And now, I can think of all the plans.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:58:35.99" data-timestamp="3515.99"> The euphoria of the regime falling was laced with heavy feelings, too. In the days following the collapse, as Salma learned just how many people who'd been disappeared by the Assad government had been killed were not coming home, she had another panic attack.</p><p begin="00:59:00.09" data-timestamp="3540.09">Salma's been watching all kinds of videos coming out of the new Syria, and there's a particular type that delights her-- one I wasn't expecting.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Salma</h4><p begin="00:59:07.99" data-timestamp="3547.99"> It was a girl in a karate uniform. And this guy was standing across from her with something on his head-- I can't remember-- like a water bottle. And she closes her eyes, and she, like, karate-kicks the water bottle off the top of his head with her eyes closed. And then the camera pans back, and everyone's, like, clapping and cheering.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:59:28.43" data-timestamp="3568.43"> Uh-huh.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Salma</h4><p begin="00:59:29.16" data-timestamp="3569.16"> I saw people doing parkour in Damascus. They're doing, like, back flips in the street in the middle of the celebration.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:59:36.07" data-timestamp="3576.07"> Watching these people just be silly and happy-- for Salma, she sees that as getting to watch them finally be free.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Salma</h4><p begin="00:59:42.81" data-timestamp="3582.81"> In Latakia, someone was lifting weights.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:59:45.01" data-timestamp="3585.01"> Like, in the street?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Salma</h4><p begin="00:59:46.36" data-timestamp="3586.36"> Like, in the street. Yeah, like, in the middle of this. There's fighters, kind of, passing by on cars, waving flowers, and he's right on the side, doing all of these moves-- [LAUGHS] in his, like, gym clothes. It's just so, so unserious, so fun.</p><p begin="01:00:04.54" data-timestamp="3604.54">It's things you could have done before, but it's just the mentality of, you're free, you can do anything, and you belong to this country, or it feels like it's yours again. I think the slogans of the regime were so damaging to our psyche, like calling it Suria al Asad-- Assad's Syria-- just-- it removes you from the equation.</p><p begin="01:00:27.70" data-timestamp="3627.7">So who are you in Assad's Syria? You're nobody. You don't belong. Seeing the people now in Syria, seeing their reaction, they're slowly kind of feeling like it is theirs-- this is our country. We're the ones who are responsible for it now. We're the ones who are going to take care of it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="01:00:45.30" data-timestamp="3645.3"> There's pretty much no way to overstate how much there is to do next, how many things will need to be figured out, how many unknowns there are. But one person told me, none of it could be worse than what we lived through already.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="01:01:04.53" data-timestamp="3664.53"> Diane Wu is a producer on our show.
