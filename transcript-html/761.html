  <h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.54" data-timestamp="0.54">From WBEZ Chicago, it's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass. So a while back, Brian Reed, who at the time was the senior producer of our show and he'd recently finished this great seven-episode podcast called S-Town, he was going around giving speeches every now and then about S-Town. And he was out giving a speech when a journalism student in Birmingham, England, approached him and told him a story, something that had been big news there. And there was still a mystery at the heart of it that nobody had ever solved.</p><p begin="00:00:33.87" data-timestamp="33.87">And Brian decided to team up with this student. And, honestly, they have been like dogs with a bone running this down, through many twists and turns, and officials trying to avoid them or shut them down. The student, Hamza Syed, is now a former journalism student and somebody who is in all of our lives. He moved here to the United States to finish the story, which became much too big to fit into one or two episodes of our program.</p><p begin="00:01:00.44" data-timestamp="60.44">So our colleagues at Serial took it over to turn into a podcast series. Sarah Koenig, the host of Serial, became their editor. The series rolled out this week. And it's spectacular, completely original. I'm very excited to play you the first installment of the show today, on our show, so you can hear what it's like. I defy you not to get caught up in the story the way that we all were. And so, with that, I'll hand things over to Hamza for part 1 of The Trojan Horse Affair.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One: Act One</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:01:30.89" data-timestamp="90.89">This is my first story as a journalist. I hadn't planned for it to be my last story, but it probably will be, given what's happened in the years I've been working on this. It's about a letter that surfaced in my city and had huge consequences for Britain. This letter launched four government investigations, changed our national policy, and ended careers. It's hurt some of the country's most vulnerable children. A letter that many people who've seen it agree is ridiculous.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tahir Alam</h4><p begin="00:02:03.53" data-timestamp="123.53"> It's unsigned, undated.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hardeep</h4><p begin="00:02:05.39" data-timestamp="125.39"> It didn't look like a serious document, did it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Razwan Faraz</h4><p begin="00:02:07.90" data-timestamp="127.9"> It just seemed comical. Like, what the hell is this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sajad</h4><p begin="00:02:10.40" data-timestamp="130.4"> I remember looking at it for some time, thinking, what on Earth is this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pauline</h4><p begin="00:02:12.93" data-timestamp="132.93"> The infamous letter, was it written on parchment, in blood?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Achmad</h4><p begin="00:02:16.36" data-timestamp="136.36"> So you're presenting me with a document that turned our lives upside down.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hamza  Syed</h4><p begin="00:02:21.23" data-timestamp="141.23"> I first learned of the letter in 2014. I wasn't a journalist then. I was a doctor who'd quit medicine, living in Birmingham, England, making my breakfast at 1:00 PM, listening to the news, when I heard about the discovery of a secret communiqué between Muslim extremists. They were discussing a plot to infiltrate our city schools and run them on strict Islamic principles, potentially with the aim of radicalizing students.</p><p begin="00:02:48.06" data-timestamp="168.06">Someone had forwarded the letter anonymously to the local government, the Birmingham City Council, but it was missing the first and last page. So it was unknown exactly who wrote it or who they were sending it to. According to the intercepted pages, the plot had a code name, Operation Trojan Horse.</p><p begin="00:03:07.20" data-timestamp="187.2">I have to admit, when this story about Muslims in Birmingham first broke, as a Muslim in Birmingham, I was alarmed. It sounded possible. Kids across Britain, across Europe, were flying off to Syria to join this group called ISIS. And Birmingham has been home to quite a few terrorists. My neighbor was a terrorist, the guy who killed five people and then tried to run into Parliament with a knife. He did his planning in a flat above the Persian restaurant across the street from me.</p><p begin="00:03:33.56" data-timestamp="213.56">So I wasn't surprised, watching, as over the next several months Operation Trojan Horse snowballed into a huge national story.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Newscaster 1</h4><p begin="00:03:39.26" data-timestamp="219.26"> A number of schools in Birmingham have been infiltrated by hard-line Muslims.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Newscaster 2</h4><p begin="00:03:43.24" data-timestamp="223.24"> Radical Muslims--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:03:44.31" data-timestamp="224.31"> Headlines like "Islamist Plot," "Jihadist Plot."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Newscaster 2</h4><p begin="00:03:46.60" data-timestamp="226.6"> Alleging a conspiracy by--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:03:48.44" data-timestamp="228.44"> And the government responded with full force. The prime minister got involved, convening his cabinet to discuss the threat. The national government sent in a bunch of investigators, including Scotland Yard's former head of counterterrorism, to look into two dozen schools in majority Muslim areas of Birmingham.</p><p begin="00:04:08.29" data-timestamp="248.29">Like I say, it was all very frightening. Until a few months later, when the various investigators finally started reporting their findings. They'd found no plot called Operation Trojan Horse. They'd seen no signs that anyone had been radicalized and no evidence of violence or planned violence. They didn't bring any terror charges against anyone working at the schools they'd looked into.</p><p begin="00:04:32.77" data-timestamp="272.77">But despite all of that, despite finding no plot, investigators still concluded that Muslims had influenced the schools in a dangerous way. Government officials snapped into action.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michael Gove</h4><p begin="00:04:43.90" data-timestamp="283.9"> Things that should not have happened in our schools were allowed to happen. Our children were exposed to things they should not have been exposed to.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Newscaster 3</h4><p begin="00:04:49.98" data-timestamp="289.98"> The fallout has been huge. Prime Minister David Cameron, as we said, is calling a special meeting of the--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:04:56.24" data-timestamp="296.24"> Officials removed educators, revamped schools, and renamed them. They mandated all schools in the country start teaching what they termed "British values," to make kids less susceptible to extremist ideas. They beefed up Britain's counter-extremism laws by making public sector workers like teachers and doctors part of the state surveillance apparatus, to now inform on their co-workers and students and patients.</p><p begin="00:05:20.54" data-timestamp="320.54">Today, the prevailing narrative of the Trojan Horse affair is that a bunch of Muslims were up to no good. There is another version of the story though. That version of the Trojan Horse Affair is that nothing happened. That these bearded Brown educators were set up. And the nation fell for it. And it's always seemed to me that there's a simple way to figure out what really happened-- the letter.</p><p begin="00:05:45.46" data-timestamp="345.46">Even with all the government inquiries, no authority, none of the investigators ever figured out who wrote it. Remarkably, none of them even tried. And that, to me, seemed like a pretty glaring oversight. The reason the country was looking at these schools in suspicion, the reason they were investigating them at all, was because this dodgy letter showed up, portraying the people who worked there as nefarious plotters, claiming they were sneaking Islam into schools, like a Trojan Horse.</p><p begin="00:06:14.76" data-timestamp="374.76">The letter is what put the idea in authorities' heads. So I didn't see how you could know what Operation Trojan Horse was or wasn't unless you got to the bottom of the Trojan Horse letter, who wrote it and why.</p><p begin="00:06:30.20" data-timestamp="390.2">A few years later, I decided to go to school for investigative journalism. But my professor wasn't completely sold on a story I wanted to report for my student project, Operation Trojan Horse. This was investigative journalism. He wanted me to unearth something new, not rake over some years-old story.</p><p begin="00:06:49.91" data-timestamp="409.91">As a doctor though, I'm familiar with the concept of a second opinion. So the night before my master's was set to start, I went looking for one.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Brian  Reed</h4><p begin="00:06:59.13" data-timestamp="419.13"> A doctor came to see me for a second opinion. One night in fall of 2017, I'm in a theater in Birmingham. After my podcast S-Town came out, I went around doing some Q&amp;As. Afterwards, people will sometimes come backstage to chat.</p><p begin="00:07:15.58" data-timestamp="435.58">And so, this guy comes in, introduces himself as Hamza Syed. He said he was changing careers to become a reporter. He was beginning a master's program in investigative journalism the next day, actually. And he wanted some advice. He was speaking fast, like I might walk away at any moment.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:07:30.77" data-timestamp="450.77"> To be fair, I was told that I had 5 minutes with Brian Reed, after which I'd be escorted out of the building.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:07:35.74" data-timestamp="455.74"> I did not know that. Anyway, Hamza ran through the Trojan Horse story for me, elevator-pitch style. I'd never heard of it. But a guy I was with backstage, a producer I know from the BBC, he had. And he jumped in as Hamza was talking. Yeah, yeah, Trojan Horse, he said. That was a big thing a while ago. Some bad stuff went down. Muslim educators had been up to no good. But it was cleared up. Old story.</p><p begin="00:07:58.11" data-timestamp="478.11">There was something Hamza said though, which afterwards I couldn't get out of my head. He kept talking about a letter which had set off this whole cascade of consequences whose origins were still a mystery. So when I got home to New York, I read the letter.</p><p begin="00:08:15.59" data-timestamp="495.59">It looked like a caricature of a missive between two terrorists, filled with Islamophobic tropes about conniving and scheming Muslims. It's missing pages. Parts of it are too dark to read, like it got jammed in the Xerox machine. It instructs the recipient to destroy it after reading.</p><p begin="00:08:31.30" data-timestamp="511.3">It struck me as a funky document for a government to take seriously, especially because, from what I read, the government hadn't even looked into who wrote the letter or why. There was a strange lack of curiosity about this instigating document. I thought to myself, seems like somebody should try to figure out who wrote that thing. And then I thought, well, wait, this journalism student's doing that. Maybe I ought to give him a hand.</p><p begin="00:08:54.44" data-timestamp="534.44">And here we are years later, at the end of a dizzying, farcical, and enraging investigation, in which one mystery led to another, led to another, tracing this letter's path of destruction across multiple continents--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:09:06.90" data-timestamp="546.9"> --in defiance of many unhappy officials and some aggressive attempts to shut our reporting down.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:09:11.83" data-timestamp="551.83"> From Serial Productions and The New York Times, I'm Brian Reed.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:09:15.64" data-timestamp="555.64"> I'm Hamza Syed.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:09:17.08" data-timestamp="557.08"> Presenting to you the most elaborate student project ever, this is The Trojan Horse Affair.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Hamza    Syed</h4><p begin="00:09:30.95" data-timestamp="570.95"> I got the call from Brian while I was in class. My phone started ringing from a New York number. I asked my professor if I could take it. He said no. I asked if I could go use a toilet. He said yes.</p><p begin="00:09:55.15" data-timestamp="595.15">I answered. And Brian told me he wanted in on my investigation, but that I would need a producer. I said, yeah, sure, all casual. I had no idea what a producer did. Soon, he started getting in touch, with missions for me to complete. The first one, he'd secured a recorder for me in Birmingham and said there was something I had to do.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:10:15.37" data-timestamp="615.37"> It was supposed to be a basic, bread-and-butter assignment, go record a meeting. Hamza had seen an event advertised called Trojan Horse, the Facts, where some of the educators who'd been accused of carrying out the plot would be speaking publicly.</p><p begin="00:10:31.60" data-timestamp="631.6">They insisted the Trojan Horse Affair was just an Islamophobic stitch-up. The event hashtag was #TrojanHoax. And they were trying to clear their names. They'd never gotten their lives back on track after the story had died down. They'd lost their jobs and been made into pariahs by the national media.</p><p begin="00:10:46.43" data-timestamp="646.43">But afterwards, Hamza calls me and says when he showed up at the spot, a community center, at 5:00 PM, the receptionist told him--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:10:53.05" data-timestamp="653.05"> It's been canceled. The event's been canceled.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:10:55.17" data-timestamp="655.17"> Did they give you any-- well, wait. Did they give you any other information? Like, what--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:10:58.84" data-timestamp="658.84"> No. They just said it's been canceled. And that was it. I said, no, this is-- you know, I spoke to the event organizer a few days ago. They said, yeah, it got canceled today. So I felt like an idiot, to be honest. Because I'm standing there with this big mic stand that looks like a fishing rod. I got my box of equipment.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:11:15.60" data-timestamp="675.6"> This can't be a good omen, I thought, to mess up your first journalism assignment. But then more people started showing up, confused like me. Until a man in one of those safety vests swings around the corner, tells us to follow him, and takes us up the street to a wedding hall where everyone was gathering instead. It's a lot of people, maybe over 100. And, as I explained to Brian, while I'm setting up the microphone--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:11:39.23" data-timestamp="699.23"> --I start catching all the whispers, in terms of what happened. And it turned out that the original venue had received phone calls from the national newspapers, specifically this guy, Nick Timothy.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:11:50.86" data-timestamp="710.86"> He's like a reporter or a publisher? Or what is he?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:11:54.08" data-timestamp="714.08"> He's a columnist, I think, for The Telegraph.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:11:56.06" data-timestamp="716.06"> And not just any old columnist. Nick Timothy used to be the chief of staff to the prime minister. He was essentially Teresa May's right-hand man. I spoke to the guy who ran the community center, who told me Nick Timothy had actually emailed, not called. He wouldn't let me see the email. But according to others at the meeting, the implication was, if you hold this event, I will associate you with extremists in the newspaper. And the community center pulled the plug.</p><p begin="00:12:23.68" data-timestamp="743.68">Nick Timothy denies contacting the community center and says he doesn't know who did or what they said. But he wrote a triumphant column about the planned meeting which I'd missed because I was on YouTube all day watching instructional videos on how to use my recorder, in which he noted, quote, "When the Daily Telegraph discovered this and contacted the owners of the venue, they rightly cancelled it." He went on to suggest the event organizers were extremists and described the proposed meeting as, quote, "a shocking attempt to deny the Trojan Horse scandal," and, quote, "the people behind the Trojan Horse are trying to do it all over again, and right under our noses."</p><p begin="00:13:00.12" data-timestamp="780.12">[APPLAUSE]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Announcer</h4><p begin="00:13:00.47" data-timestamp="780.47"> Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to Trojan Horse or Hoax, the discussion and debate.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:13:08.09" data-timestamp="788.09"> So here they were, the teachers and school volunteers allegedly behind Operation Trojan Horse, along with their defenders, academics and activists and an educational barrister and a union leader, packed in this wedding hall instead.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Salma  Yaqoob</h4><p begin="00:13:22.12" data-timestamp="802.12"> I am really, really concerned that simply holding a public open meeting like this becomes controversial. Just the fact we are holding this meeting seems to be an act of resistance right now.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:13:39.61" data-timestamp="819.61"> The people at this meeting called for an inquiry to correct the record on the Trojan Horse affair. They believed the government had set them up. So the fact that a former chief of staff to the prime minister, Nick Timothy, went out of his way to attack a grassroots event at a community center years after the Trojan Horse Affair, it just reinforced their suspicion-- and mine, quite honestly-- that there was something dodgy that authorities were still keen to hide.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Parent</h4><p begin="00:14:04.34" data-timestamp="844.34"> And then it was like a witch hunt. Heads were rolling this way and that way.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:14:08.96" data-timestamp="848.96"> Hamza sent me the recording of the meeting. I listened to it. And I was interested to hear that one of the people who got on stage and spoke was the man named repeatedly in the Trojan Horse letter as the mastermind of Operation Trojan Horse, the plot's alleged ringleader, a longtime school volunteer named Tahir Alam.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tahir Alam</h4><p begin="00:14:28.31" data-timestamp="868.31"> I've never been a danger to anyone. I've never hurt anyone. I've never had any police case against me or anything of the kind. I wasn't running a plot. We are very proud of what we did in these schools. I do not regret nor apologize for anything that I've done. There was nothing clandestine, hidden, or sinister about what we were doing. We were very open and very transparent.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:14:47.91" data-timestamp="887.91"> So when I landed in Birmingham to begin reporting, that's who we decided to go to first, Tahir Alam. We figured, we're looking to find the source of this mysterious letter. Might as well start with the guy it outed as an extremist plotter.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:15:02.09" data-timestamp="902.09"> Is this about to be the first radio interview you've ever done?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:15:04.76" data-timestamp="904.76"> Yeah. I need to be schooled beforehand, mate.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:15:08.83" data-timestamp="908.83"> What do you mean? Like, how so?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:15:10.96" data-timestamp="910.96"> Well, I mean, if this is me flying solo, I would be like, well, whatever. I'll just do it my style, you know. But this is--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:15:17.77" data-timestamp="917.77"> And what is your style? Do you have a style?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:15:19.88" data-timestamp="919.88"> I don't know. I feel like I'm a lot--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:15:21.78" data-timestamp="921.78"> How many of these have you done?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:15:23.01" data-timestamp="923.01"> None.</p><p begin="00:15:23.97" data-timestamp="923.97">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:15:25.11" data-timestamp="925.11">But I have an idea in my head of what my style could be.

There are protractors lying around, a whiteboard with sketches of geometric shapes, a creative writing workbook titled "Descriptosaurus." Tahir's converted this room from his garage into a tiny makeshift classroom, where it appears he tutor students quietly. Because one result of the Trojan Horse letter is that the government has banned him from ever volunteering or working officially in schools again.</p><p begin="00:16:27.02" data-timestamp="987.02">Tahir's in front of us in his office chair, confident, erudite, framed by his bookshelf filled with texts about Islam and British history. I pull a copy of the letter out of my backpack.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tahir Alam</h4><p begin="00:16:37.00" data-timestamp="997"> You know, it's a completely anonymous letter, undated, claiming that there is a plot to take over and Islamize the schools in Birmingham, led by Tahir Alam, which is myself. But I speak from a vantage point where I actually know the truth. I know the reality.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Brian  Reed</h4><p begin="00:16:57.20" data-timestamp="1017.2"> Tahir denies being an extremist. He denies engineering a plot. He says the reality is that, rather than corrupting schools as a radical conspirator, he, a first generation immigrant from a poor Pakistani family, was responsible for one of the most miraculous school turnarounds in British education. Until, he says, the letter arrived and destroyed him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Hamza   Syed</h4><p begin="00:17:22.16" data-timestamp="1042.16"> The story of this turnaround, it's not a secret. It's one Tahir shared with journalists before, not that it's done much good, in terms of clearing his name. But this back story does explain why the Trojan Horse letter was so persuasive. Because, Tahir told us, some of what was in that letter was true.</p><p begin="00:17:44.90" data-timestamp="1064.9">Tahir begins the story one night in 1993 when he's watching TV, and a show caught his attention.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tahir Alam</h4><p begin="00:17:50.64" data-timestamp="1070.64"> I just happened to be just lying on the sofa, really, and the program came on.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:17:54.77" data-timestamp="1074.77"> It was a documentary, part of the BBC series, Panorama.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tahir Alam</h4><p begin="00:17:58.55" data-timestamp="1078.55"> 9 times out of 10, I would switch to something else.

It's one of the poorest areas in England, and it's majority Pakistani and Muslim. If you're not from Birmingham and you're not Brown, you may have heard that Alum Rock is a great place to find a terrorist. If you're not from Birmingham and you are Brown, you'll have heard Alum Rock is a great place to find a wedding dress.</p><p begin="00:19:31.51" data-timestamp="1171.51">Admittedly, this BBC documentary is racist in a '90s TV kind of way. But it had a big impact on Tahir because, amidst the awkward Brown gazing, some truly sobering facts emerge. The presenter reports that Pakistani Muslims are incarcerated at disproportionately high rates. She says they have some of the highest rates of joblessness. They're suffering from devastating health issues, terrible housing, domestic violence, with one underlying cause of it all, a lack of education.</p><p begin="00:19:59.78" data-timestamp="1199.78">This is the number I found more shocking. About 20% of white students were leaving school without any qualifications, meaning they failed to pass exams that would essentially be the equivalent of a high school diploma in the US. And that rate, 20%, was roughly the same for most people of color as well.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Documentary Presenter</h4><p begin="00:20:15.52" data-timestamp="1215.52"> But for Pakistanis and Bangladeshis, an astonishing 50% hold no qualifications whatsoever.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hamza  Syed</h4><p begin="00:20:23.54" data-timestamp="1223.54"> 50%, half of us, were basically failing school. That hit Tahir hard.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tahir Alam</h4><p begin="00:20:30.19" data-timestamp="1230.19"> That the extent of education failure was so bad that we were at risk of creating an underclass of Muslims who were basically uneducated, prone to crime and unemployment. So I kind of sat there, and it made me feel guilty, actually. Guilt because I was one of the few people who made it-- from my family, one of the first ones to make it into university and to have a good job, and so on. But there was also a sense of humiliation, really, because I was from this community.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hamza  Syed</h4><p begin="00:21:05.86" data-timestamp="1265.86"> Tahir's family brought him to England in the '70s when lots of people from Kashmir were moving here, largely because the British designed this huge dam that flooded swaths of land and displaced tens of thousands of people. And one solution the Brits got behind was to invite displaced Pakistanis over to England so they could improve the British economy by working in British factories and mills.</p><p begin="00:21:27.03" data-timestamp="1287.03">Which is what Tahir's dad did. Tahir arrived in England as a nine-year-old who didn't speak any English and wouldn't become fluent for several years.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tahir Alam</h4><p begin="00:21:34.37" data-timestamp="1294.37"> I knew one word of English only, which was F-O-R-D.

So that's how you arrived here. And the first school, when I came here, we arrived--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Documentary Presenter</h4><p begin="00:21:57.04" data-timestamp="1317.04"> --potentially the biggest ethnic group in the country is growing up angry and alienated from white society.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:22:03.56" data-timestamp="1323.56"> Now Tahir watched as the documentary captured the next generation, Pakistani kids who were born in Britain, being educated in state schools, still struggling to read, not able to recall basic English words.</p><p begin="00:22:15.71" data-timestamp="1335.71">The camera cuts to a park in Birmingham. It looked to Tahir like Ward End Park, which is right across from where he went to school in Alum Rock.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tahir Alam</h4><p begin="00:22:23.41" data-timestamp="1343.41"> I recognized the park because we used to go and play there. And then I saw some children. And I said, oh, that's our neighbors' children. I recognized the kids, yeah, even though it was from a distance. But I recognized who the kids are.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Documentary Presenter</h4><p begin="00:22:35.04" data-timestamp="1355.04"> We filmed an encounter with two Asian lads in a park in a Muslim quarter of Birmingham.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:22:40.57" data-timestamp="1360.57"> These Asian lads-- we use "Asian" to mean South Asian, by the way-- they're skipping school. And Tahir knew which school they were skipping. It's the one he'd gone to as a kid, right next to that park, Park View School, another majority-Muslim school with miserable academic results. It's a secondary school, ages 11 to 16. It was a school where Tahir had done well enough to make it to college and then university before getting a good job in telecommunications. The documentary made him realize how rare his success was and how little he'd done with it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian  Reed</h4><p begin="00:23:13.20" data-timestamp="1393.2"> So Tahir decided to do something. He started a tutoring program for kids in the neighborhood. But what he was really interested in was volunteering at his old school, Park View, on what's known as their governing body. In England, a governing body oversees how a school is run, like a corporate board does a company. It's sort of like a school board in the US, except it's specific to one school. They can have a lot of influence.</p><p begin="00:23:39.04" data-timestamp="1419.04">So anyway, Tahir says one afternoon a couple of Park View parents he didn't know knocked on his door. We hear you're interested in becoming a governor, they said. It was like they'd read his mind. Though, actually, Tahir had been talking about wanting to be a governor at a recent wedding, and these parents got wind of it.</p><p begin="00:23:54.03" data-timestamp="1434.03">Resentment and frustration had been festering for years among parents in Alum Rock, who'd been trying and trying to get the authorities to do something about the dismal schools. These parents at Tahir's door had joined the Park View governing body in an attempt to make a change. But they didn't speak fluent English and hadn't gone to university. Tahir was a professional with a degree who still lived in the neighborhood.</p><p begin="00:24:15.81" data-timestamp="1455.81">We'd love to propose you, they told him. And with that, Tahir found himself at the next governing body meeting of Park View School, being voted in not only as a member but as the chair.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tahir Alam</h4><p begin="00:24:27.60" data-timestamp="1467.6"> So that's when I became a governor, on the 7th of January, 1997.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:24:32.01" data-timestamp="1472.01"> You remember the date?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tahir Alam</h4><p begin="00:24:33.46" data-timestamp="1473.46"> Yeah, well, I was to remain there for 18 years.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:24:36.54" data-timestamp="1476.54"> When Tahir started, Park View was one of the worst secondary schools in the country. Only 4% of students were passing, 4%. The National School Inspection Agency had recently placed the school into special measures, the lowest possible ranking, an emergency status, basically, meaning Park View was in danger of being shut down.</p><p begin="00:24:57.47" data-timestamp="1497.47">There were brawls breaking out in the schoolyard. On a tour of the building, Tahir saw vandalized bathrooms with stalls missing locks and toilets missing seats. But where Tahir really trained his focus was on the complacent teachers and administrators.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tahir Alam</h4><p begin="00:25:10.89" data-timestamp="1510.89"> We initially just started by saying that, obviously, children should be achieving higher, that the achievement was not acceptable, and the fact that the school was to blame for the failure.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:25:21.20" data-timestamp="1521.2"> This statement, so obvious to Tahir, that the kids in Alum Rock were as capable as kids anywhere, was met with massive resistance.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tahir Alam</h4><p begin="00:25:30.02" data-timestamp="1530.02"> It was very difficult getting the school to accept that they were the problem. People didn't want to accept that because they'd been blaming the community for maybe two decades. They had such a low expectation of children.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:25:44.19" data-timestamp="1544.19"> One thing Tahir noticed early on was that the staff of this school with nearly 90% Pakistani students had only one full-time Pakistani Muslim teacher. So Tahir begin searching for more Muslim staff and governors. He gave presentations, held workshops. He became a fixture at events around East Birmingham, standing behind his little table or booth, evangelizing for people to get involved in their local schools.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Moz Hussain</h4><p begin="00:26:09.25" data-timestamp="1569.25"> I loved it. [LAUGHS] I loved it with the children because I felt as though I could make a difference.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:26:15.85" data-timestamp="1575.85"> This is Moz Hussain, the first Muslim teacher Tahir hired. He taught math.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Moz Hussain</h4><p begin="00:26:20.36" data-timestamp="1580.36"> I could use my language, my background, my understanding of where they come from, to make a difference. I knew their families.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:26:27.16" data-timestamp="1587.16"> Moz can point to a specific moment, by the way, when he decided to go into teaching.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Moz Hussain</h4><p begin="00:26:32.70" data-timestamp="1592.7"> There was a Panorama program. It's called An Underclass in Purdah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:26:37.31" data-timestamp="1597.31"> Powerful segment.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:26:41.08" data-timestamp="1601.08"> Moz Hussain says from the very beginning he encountered serious prejudices among the mostly white staff.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Moz Hussain</h4><p begin="00:26:48.41" data-timestamp="1608.41"> I had a group of children come to me. And they said, look, there's this one teacher in school. He always calls us Pakis. He's calling us Pakis. He's doing it in a jokey way, but we find it offensive. They're not able to tell anyone else, but they're telling me that, look, he's swearing at us.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:27:03.78" data-timestamp="1623.78"> That's a slur in any context, but especially shocking for a teacher to say to Pakistani students. Moz told them, I think the best thing to do, have your parents write the school. He talked them through the procedure for doing that, in case their parents didn't know. He says eventually the school looked into the teacher's behavior.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Moz Hussain</h4><p begin="00:27:21.04" data-timestamp="1641.04"> And while they were investigating, he resigned. And he gave his final leaving speech in the staff room. And goes, it should be our culture dominant in this school, not the kids. And he finished off with the words, the West is the best. And all teachers clapped. All teachers clapped.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian  Reed</h4><p begin="00:27:41.22" data-timestamp="1661.22"> The racism was pervasive. Razwan Faraz, a former governor and math teacher, says at one of his first governing body meetings he was shown a list of places the students had been given work placements through a program at the school. And it was all restaurants, supermarkets, clothing stores.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Razwan Faraz</h4><p begin="00:27:58.42" data-timestamp="1678.42"> And there was no surgery, doctor surgery, or law firm, or anything like that. And I said, how is it that-- did the children decide these?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:28:08.20" data-timestamp="1688.2"> And Razwan says the vice chair told him--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Razwan Faraz</h4><p begin="00:28:11.01" data-timestamp="1691.01"> Well, their parents want them to go and become doctors, and engineers, and et cetera. But reality is, these kids will become taxi drivers, shopkeepers, so we've got to prepare them now.</p><p begin="00:28:22.13" data-timestamp="1702.13">And for a good while I was struggling to process what he was saying. This is me, a Brown person, and a Muslim, and he's saying to me that they deserve to have these kind of jobs.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:28:37.12" data-timestamp="1717.12"> This is this community's role in society, basically.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Razwan Faraz</h4><p begin="00:28:39.77" data-timestamp="1719.77"> That's right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Brockley</h4><p begin="00:28:41.37" data-timestamp="1721.37"> We just failed the kids. We just failed the kids. And didn't even feel bad about it. Didn't even-- we didn't. Didn't even feel guilty.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:28:49.27" data-timestamp="1729.27"> John Brockley was one of the non-Muslim teachers at Park View. He was a math teacher who'd been there since the '80s. He was frank with us about the bigotry that he and his colleagues held towards the students and their families.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>  John  Brockley</h4><p begin="00:29:01.67" data-timestamp="1741.67"> We thought that we were a superior culture. And we looked down. We looked down on these people who didn't know about education.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:29:14.89" data-timestamp="1754.89"> You're talking about yourself here?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Brockley</h4><p begin="00:29:17.59" data-timestamp="1757.59"> I'm talking about myself, but I'm also talking about many of the people that I worked with.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:29:22.29" data-timestamp="1762.29"> The teachers attitudes are documented, by the way. A former headteacher of Park View-- a headteacher is what we Americans call a principal-- did a master's thesis while he was at the school, for which he collected opinions from the staff, including from John, as to why Muslim children were drastically underperforming compared to their peers.</p><p begin="00:29:42.63" data-timestamp="1782.63">In the thesis, teachers say the kids parents are ignorant, wrongly claim the students don't speak English. The teachers try for a while, one teacher said, but end up feeling like, who gives a damn. That's a quote. It makes John cringe to think back on it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Brockley</h4><p begin="00:29:57.07" data-timestamp="1797.07"> It's only when you when you move away from a situation like that that you can realize how awful it is. I don't normally think about this sort of thing because it's too embarrassing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tahir  Alam</h4><p begin="00:30:11.49" data-timestamp="1811.49"> Once we created the shift in the belief of the teachers, then the job became much easier.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hamza  Syed</h4><p begin="00:30:20.15" data-timestamp="1820.15"> Tahir says by the early 2000s, Park View was changing. The school began taking basic but transformative steps, setting individualized achievement targets for each student that followed them from year to year, and preparing students for qualifying exams which, amazingly, hadn't happened before. School started awarding trophies for good marks, inviting parents to ceremonies when their kids did well.</p><p begin="00:30:44.06" data-timestamp="1844.06">Tahir and the governor's hired a new headteacher, a non-Muslim woman from a girls' school, who embraced Park View's new aspirations. Test scores started to rise. Students were heading to college. Park View's reputation was turning around. But there were other changes Tahir instituted at Park View which, later, officials would view as suspect, changes that investigators would point to as the trademarks of Operation Trojan Horse. That's coming up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira  Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:11.58" data-timestamp="1871.58"> Indeed it is, when Hamza and Brian return.

Today on our program, we are playing part 1 of the newest podcast from our sister company, Serial Productions. The show is called The Trojan Horse Affair. And we pick up with Brian and Hamza where they left off.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:31:36.17" data-timestamp="1896.17"> You don't get labeled the leader of an extremist conspiracy simply by raising test scores at your neighborhood secondary school. The main accusation against Tahir Alam, the overarching assertion of the Trojan Horse letter, which the government supported and which has defined Tahir's reputation since then, is that he was Islamizing schools.</p><p begin="00:31:55.67" data-timestamp="1915.67">This is not a word I'm particularly fond of, "Islamize," because Islamize in relation to what, some assumed non-Islamic baseline? Has this story been Islamized by Hamza's involvement?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:32:05.92" data-timestamp="1925.92"> Yes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:32:06.99" data-timestamp="1926.99"> It's a word that isn't inherently negative but gets used that way. Anyway, that's what the letter said Tahir was doing, Islamizing schools. And, funnily enough, it's also what Tahir says he was doing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tahir Alam</h4><p begin="00:32:17.23" data-timestamp="1937.23"> We were valuing the cultural and the faith background of the children. And we were allowing that to be expressed, if you like. We catered for children so they could perform their daytime prayers if they wanted to. We made a prayer facility available for them in a room.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:32:36.41" data-timestamp="1956.41"> Religious accommodations like this are legal in British schools, by the way, whether they're explicitly designated as a religious school or not, which Park View wasn't. It was the equivalent of a regular public school in the US.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tahir Alam</h4><p begin="00:32:47.77" data-timestamp="1967.77"> And since 98% of the children happened to be of the Islamic faith background, we obviously are catering for the constituency that the school serves, in line with the regulatory requirements.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:32:59.60" data-timestamp="1979.6"> Tahir ascribed to an educational philosophy that, the way he and other Park View staff talk about it, reminds me of Afrocentric or Black Excellence schools in the US, that students will do better academically when their schools incorporate and celebrate who they are. And there's research that backs this up.</p><p begin="00:33:16.92" data-timestamp="1996.92">So, under Tahir's leadership, Park View allowed students to pray if they wanted. They installed facilities for wudu, the ablutions you do before prayers. They celebrated Ramadan and altered the schedule during that month to facilitate fasting. They served halal food.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tahir Alam</h4><p begin="00:33:31.29" data-timestamp="2011.29"> And I felt that, you know, this was our school. I mean, we were proud to say that this is our school. We wanted our children to say that this was their school and that they were proud of it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:33:39.33" data-timestamp="2019.33"> In the wake of the Trojan Horse letter, government officials would declare that the way Tahir and his colleagues were running Park View school had undermined, quote, unquote, British values, that they were limiting the children's ability to thrive in modern Britain. Which is an interesting charge to bring against Tahir because, I have to say, I haven't personally met an English Pakistani more confident that he's British than Tahir.</p><p begin="00:34:03.06" data-timestamp="2043.06">Deciding whether or not to call yourself British is a fraught and personal thing for us. Speaking for myself, even though I came to England when I was 8, and became a British citizen with a British passport, even though I have a British education, went to British University, worked for Britain's National Health Service, I didn't call myself British. I was never precious about nationality, so I didn't really care what I was called. But sure, I'd also picked up on the subliminal messaging that in order to be proper British you had to be white.</p><p begin="00:34:30.43" data-timestamp="2070.43">Tahir, on the other hand, not only calls himself British, but does so proudly. I got to talking to Tahir about this one day.

I know this is somewhat of an apples and oranges comparison because the world wasn't organized into a globalized economy back then. But it does show how rich India was in relation to other countries at the time.

The idea of teachers in a public school leading prayers during assembly is not normal to us. But in Britain, there's no separation between church and state. The queen is head of both. So not only is prayer allowed in schools, some form of worship is legally mandated in all schools that are publicly funded.</p><p begin="00:38:33.48" data-timestamp="2313.48">Schools don't always adhere to this, but students are supposed to take part in what's called a daily act of collective worship. By default, it's supposed to be broadly Christian in character. But schools can apply to change it to other faiths, if that better suits their students. Which is what Park View did, it got approval for its worship to be Islamic.</p><p begin="00:38:51.22" data-timestamp="2331.22">The students told us, at Park View's assemblies they would sit in the main hall and a teacher would tell parables or lessons, usually from Islam, but other faiths too.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:38:58.50" data-timestamp="2338.5"> Do you guys remember actually learning things in these assemblies?

And over the years, he expanded his reach beyond Park View. He was certified as an inspector for Ofsted, the agency that monitors and rates schools in Britain. The Birmingham City Council hired him to train other governors throughout the city. The national department for education even asked Tahir and his colleagues at Park View to take over two other troubled schools in East Birmingham, which they did. Tahir was invited to tea at 10 Downing Street and met Prime Minister Tony Blair.

But still, he and other former colleagues told us they wished Tahir was a bit more circumspect in the way he went around to other schools, advocating for reform. He was self-assured, blunt, and particularly unsparing when laying out for headteachers and other school leaders the way their schools were failing Muslim students.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Moz Hussain</h4><p begin="00:43:02.45" data-timestamp="2582.45"> To tell other schools, look, Park View can do it. Park View can do it. Park View can do it. Same family, same children that you got, they can do it. That's not an excuse. We used to tell Tahir off for this a lot.

In what was probably its proudest moment in Tahir's nearly 18 years there, Ofsted arrived for an inspection and deemed the school outstanding, the highest rating possible. Among the many things inspectors praised at Park View were the, quote, "wide range of opportunities for spiritual development, including voluntary Friday prayers."</p><p begin="00:44:43.44" data-timestamp="2683.44">In his time as chair of governors, Tahir had taken Park View from the lowest ranking, the verge of closure, to the very top.

He heard rumors there was a mysterious letter making its way around Birmingham, around the city council and to headteachers in town, which named him as the orchestrator of a plot. One of Tahir's friends rushed to his house to tell him that he'd been getting a haircut over on Washwood Heath Road and, afterwards, his friend's barber had beckoned him into the back room of the shop and showed him a copy. Tahir did not know what to make of it. Finally, he got a hold of the document himself.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tahir Alam</h4><p begin="00:46:27.43" data-timestamp="2787.43"> You know, obviously, I was thinking, what is the source of this letter?

They stalked Tahir down the street--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reporter 1</h4><p begin="00:49:56.94" data-timestamp="2996.94"> We tried to put these allegations to the Academy's Chair of Governors, but Tahir Alam--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:50:01.14" data-timestamp="3001.14"> --turned up at his house.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tahir Alam</h4><p begin="00:50:02.00" data-timestamp="3002"> Hello.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reporter  2</h4><p begin="00:50:02.83" data-timestamp="3002.83"> Hello, Mr. Alam?

You must have a family.</p><p begin="00:50:49.88" data-timestamp="3049.88">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:50:50.28" data-timestamp="3050.28"> There was more. The Secretary of State for Education called in England's former counterterror chief from Scotland Yard, a man named Peter Clarke. And the Birmingham City Council appointed its own special investigator. And they scrutinized Park View along with 20-some-odd other schools in Muslim neighborhoods.</p><p begin="00:51:09.53" data-timestamp="3069.53">In the middle of the melee, some politicians and journalists were saying that the letter itself was likely a hoax. There was some obvious factual inaccuracies. Yet the government believed it still warranted this action. Honestly, I don't think any authority explained this logic with much clarity at the time.</p><p begin="00:51:26.41" data-timestamp="3086.41">But my understanding of how the thinking went is that, even if the letter itself wasn't an actual communiqué between two real-life conspirators, it could still be pointing at a real problem. Even if it was fiction, the thinking went, the letter could have been fabricated by someone who had legitimate concerns about Muslim extremists scheming and wielding influence in schools. And maybe the letter was their creative way of raising an alarm.</p><p begin="00:51:49.71" data-timestamp="3109.71">So rather than look into who wrote the letter and why, instead, the government put out general public calls for information about these schools. And people started coming forward, mostly anonymously, with complaints. Again, investigators found no evidence of radicalization, no evidence of violent extremism, and no plot. What emerged instead was a kind of grab bag of Islam-adjacent allegations.</p><p begin="00:52:12.12" data-timestamp="3132.12">Many of the same things authorities had celebrated up to that point, but apparently now were seeing in a different light. Like, these educators weren't merely allowing students to pray. They were pressuring them to pray. They weren't innocently recruiting Brown Muslim staff. They were hiring their buddies who thought the same way as they did, and possibly discriminating against non-Muslim candidates in the process.</p><p begin="00:52:32.73" data-timestamp="3152.73">School governors, including Tahir, they weren't holding headteachers to a high standard. They were pressuring them, harassing them, and exercising more power than a governor was supposed to. Investigators also said they'd found instances of intolerance towards LGBTQ people and unequal treatment of women and girls. They said Park View had held assemblies and invited speakers with anti-Western views. And that Tahir and people aligned with him allegedly subscribed to, quote, "An intolerant and politicized form of extreme social conservatism that claims to represent, and ultimately seeks to control, all Muslims."</p><p begin="00:53:10.47" data-timestamp="3190.47">All of this, as the then Secretary of State for Education put it as she presented the findings on the Trojan Horse letter to Parliament, meant that students--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nicky Morgan</h4><p begin="00:53:18.47" data-timestamp="3198.47"> Instead of enjoying a broadening and enriching experience in school, young people are having their horizons narrowed and are being denied the opportunity to flourish in a modern, multicultural Britain.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tahir Alam</h4><p begin="00:53:30.97" data-timestamp="3210.97"> It is for this reason, and with a deep sense of injustice and sadness, that today we are announcing our intention to resign our positions at Park View Educational Trust and allow new members to assume responsibility with the--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:53:44.61" data-timestamp="3224.61"> After months of scrutiny, in early July, 2014, Tahir, looking tired and stressed, stood at a lectern outside Park View's gates and resigned. Tahir told us he and the other Park View governors only agreed to do that because the Department for Education promised that the head teacher and other on-the-ground leadership of the school would be kept in place.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tahir Alam</h4><p begin="00:54:06.37" data-timestamp="3246.37"> But as soon as school opened in September, all of those people were suspended. All the leadership was basically sacked. Ruthlessly, they went about it destroying their careers, destroying their reputations. And they did that systematically. We had worked for 10, 15 years, really, to build this school. They destroyed it within months.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Brian  Reed</h4><p begin="00:54:30.50" data-timestamp="3270.5"> The government renamed the school. It's no longer Park View. It also notified nearly every teacher and governor you just heard from, Tahir included, that it was bringing proceedings to ban them from education for the rest of their lives.</p><p begin="00:54:48.24" data-timestamp="3288.24">In the years since, student achievement has plummeted at the school formerly known as Park View. From more than 70% passing to, in recent years, from the low-40% to mid-50% range.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:54:58.98" data-timestamp="3298.98"> So that's the story Tahir told us, that first meeting, in his makeshift tutoring room, that this letter, which was never fully investigated, that described a plot called Operation Trojan Horse, which was never found to have existed, inspired all of this, the ruining of careers and an educational movement, the fear-mongering headlines against Muslims that continue to this day, the government instituting policies that encourage us to spy more brazenly on each other. We'd been talking with Tahir for a couple of hours by this point.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:55:32.67" data-timestamp="3332.67"> What time is it? I know you need to leave at some point. I don't want--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Tahir Alam</h4><p begin="00:55:34.97" data-timestamp="3334.97"> I mean, I'm-- I have to go to Friday prayer now.

So if you wanted to--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tahir Alam</h4><p begin="00:55:43.08" data-timestamp="3343.08"> There's a lot to-- no, no, I don't get tired of talking these things really. I mean, you probably could tell. Obviously, when I talk about that, you know, you begin to relive it, isn't it? And I have to say that it does sadden me, actually, as to what has been lost for the children, for the community, the irreparable damage that has been done for absolutely no reason whatsoever. So, anyway, can I get you guys some tea or something?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>     Hamza  Syed</h4><p begin="00:56:18.48" data-timestamp="3378.48"> At that event I went to, where we all got redirected to the wedding hall, one of the speakers, a columnist named Peter Oborne, put it well. He said Operation Trojan Horse has become a social fact in Britain. That, even though within weeks that the Trojan Horse started hitting the news, people acknowledged it was probably a hoax, that's never seemed to matter. Whether Muslims in Birmingham were conspiring or not doesn't matter. The intimation that they were has persevered, to the extent that a prime minister's former chief of staff was outraged that some people in the community center would dare to say otherwise.</p><p begin="00:56:57.28" data-timestamp="3417.28">But we don't need to settle for a social fact because there are actual facts. Why, up to this point, has no one cared about who wrote this letter and where this letter came from?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Tahir  Alam</h4><p begin="00:57:10.77" data-timestamp="3430.77"> Well, that's my question.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Hamza Syed</h4><p begin="00:57:13.01" data-timestamp="3433.01"> (LAUGHING) That's my question.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tahir Alam</h4><p begin="00:57:15.31" data-timestamp="3435.31"> This is what I've been arguing. This is why I went to the police to see what they could do. This is what I wrote in my letter to the Birmingham City Council, that you need to get to the bottom of who wrote the letter. This is what I wrote to the Department of Education as well. You need to get to the bottom of the letter, who wrote the letter. Because that will then unravel why the letter was written. You see? So this is what I have been arguing.</p><p begin="00:57:43.60" data-timestamp="3463.6">But Department of Education is not interested. The police are not interested. The Birmingham City Council is not interested in answering that question.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Hamza  Syed</h4><p begin="00:57:52.85" data-timestamp="3472.85"> Why?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tahir Alam</h4><p begin="00:57:54.30" data-timestamp="3474.3"> Because they have used this letter. And on this hoax they have built so much policy. Do you think now they want to launch an investigation into the letter to have it proven that it was written for completely different reasons? Yeah? How would that make them look like? A bunch of monkeys.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hamza  Syed</h4><p begin="00:58:14.05" data-timestamp="3494.05"> As I've been saying, if you could just find out who wrote that letter and why, that's the only thing that might change Britain's understanding of Operation Trojan Horse.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Tahir Alam</h4><p begin="00:58:25.65" data-timestamp="3505.65"> But whoever wrote the letter, they knew me, I think.
