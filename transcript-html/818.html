  <h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:11.66" data-timestamp="11.66"> New York City, the Port Authority Bus Terminal, a very cold night, a few weeks ago--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:16.77" data-timestamp="16.77"> Yeah, explain what time it is, and where we are and what we're doing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:00:19.91" data-timestamp="19.91"> It is 11:14 PM. And we are waiting for a Texas bus.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:25.82" data-timestamp="25.82"> Texas bus with who inside?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:00:27.86" data-timestamp="27.86"> So we don't know the number yet, but we have asylum seekers that are there that just come from the border.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:33.09" data-timestamp="33.09"> This is one of the buses that Governor Greg Abbott sent to New York City, starting in the summer of last year. You probably heard about this. Hoping to make a point about what Texas is dealing with, he sent migrants on buses to cities run by Democrats-- Washington, DC, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Denver, and New York.</p><p begin="00:00:50.15" data-timestamp="50.15">Over 27,000 people have arrived at this spot this way, where many of them have been greeted by a 5'2" Black woman, named Adama Bah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:59.09" data-timestamp="59.09"> How many nights a week do you do this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:01:01.53" data-timestamp="61.53"> Mm. I don't keep count anymore. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:06.03" data-timestamp="66.03"> But what's the most it gets? Like, what's a hard week for you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:01:09.95" data-timestamp="69.95"> A hard week is every day, a bus. I put the kids to sleep, and then I ran over here. I'm a mommy. And I'll make it back in time, where they won't notice I'm gone.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:21.66" data-timestamp="81.66"> Do they know you left?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:01:23.07" data-timestamp="83.07"> No.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:25.01" data-timestamp="85.01"> Thing is, Adama doesn't work for the city of New York. She runs a community center for newly arrived immigrants, called Afrikana. She's been doing this work with migrants for 18 years-- for a long time, just out of her car, though she still does a lot of work from her car, going around a city to where recent migrants are, talking to them in the car.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:01:42.68" data-timestamp="102.68"> My car has been my office for years, and it's still my office.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:46.76" data-timestamp="106.76"> And are there certain things you always are sure that you keep in the car?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:01:49.94" data-timestamp="109.94"> I have so many stuff. So organizer 101 is always have a portable charger, paper and pen. I have toothbrush, toothpaste-- peppermint, because I'm always talking to people. I don't think-- I don't want to be known as the lady with the bad breath.</p><p begin="00:02:04.25" data-timestamp="124.25">[LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:02:05.18" data-timestamp="125.18">She can help you, but she has a bad breath. I have deodorant, emergency change of clothes. Because sometimes-- it's not on purpose, but I spend overnight.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:15.44" data-timestamp="135.44"> Have you had to sleep overnight here, waiting for buses?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:02:17.93" data-timestamp="137.93"> Yeah, I have. I have pillows. I have a blanket.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:21.77" data-timestamp="141.77"> When the very first bus arrived from Texas in August 2022, it was migrant aid groups like Adama's who got advance word that it was coming and greeted the bus-- not the city. But soon enough, the city government got on board. Mayor Eric Adams showed up at the Port Authority to greet one of the buses, ready to prove that New York City is a city of immigrants that loves and welcomes immigrants.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Eric Adams</h4><p begin="00:02:43.95" data-timestamp="163.95"> I have to provide services for families that are here, and that's what we're going to do, and that's what our responsibility as a city-- I'm proud that this is a right-to-shelter state.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:54.12" data-timestamp="174.12"> Right to shelter-- that means that New York City had to provide temporary housing to anyone who needs it. And the city took that seriously.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:03:01.92" data-timestamp="181.92"> They started to show up. They set up operations.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:04.95" data-timestamp="184.95"> And where did the city do its operation? What was it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:03:06.81" data-timestamp="186.81"> Inside there in Port Authority.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:08.64" data-timestamp="188.64"> Right through those doors here?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:03:09.60" data-timestamp="189.6"> Right through those doors.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:11.31" data-timestamp="191.31"> On that spot, the city would take people's names and information, and then send them on to shelters. Groups like Adama's would hand out food, clothing, toiletries. As word got out that New York City would house everyone who showed up, more and more people started arriving.</p><p begin="00:03:26.10" data-timestamp="206.1">Today, the 27,000 people that Governor Abbott sent are just a tiny portion of the 150,000 who've shown up on buses, trains, cars, and planes since the spring of 2022. New York City was not set up to help this many people this way. The right to shelter was created for homeless men in the Bowery, not for thousands of new arrivals each week.</p><p begin="00:03:47.49" data-timestamp="227.49">By this fall, it was costing the city $10 million a night, and the mayor completely changed his tune. Yes, New York loves immigrants, but not this many this fast, needing assistance. And the mayor became a kind of one-man unwelcome wagon, flying to Ecuador and Colombia and Mexico to hold press conferences saying, don't come to New York, declaring a state of emergency in the city, begging the federal government for help, which did not arrive.</p><p begin="00:04:14.13" data-timestamp="254.13">By October of this year, the city had spent over $2 billion and opened over 200 emergency shelters. It had cut the amount of time that immigrants could stay in a shelter from as long as they needed to 60 days for families and 30 days for individuals. And finally, in October, New York went to court to change the law and suspend the right to shelter for the city. Mayor Adams started saying that migrants will be sleeping on the streets. It's not a question of if, but when.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Eric Adams</h4><p begin="00:04:41.87" data-timestamp="281.87"> We're getting 10,000 migrants a month.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:46.29" data-timestamp="286.29"> This is Mayor Adams this fall.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Eric Adams</h4><p begin="00:04:47.91" data-timestamp="287.91"> This issue will destroy New York City, destroy New York City. Every community in this city is going to be impacted. We have a $12 billion deficit that we're going to have to cut. Every service in this city is going to be impacted, all of us.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:12.49" data-timestamp="312.49"> Or maybe it's not quite that bad. The city's chief fiscal officer, the comptroller, says the mayor is overblowing the effects of the migrants on the city's budget. And one political question in New York is whether the mayor is now scapegoating the migrants to push through budget cuts he'd hoped to do anyway. Though it is true that money is tight, one day, Adama says, city personnel just didn't show up at Port Authority anymore to greet immigrants.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:05:35.20" data-timestamp="335.2"> They just stopped. They didn't tell us that they were stopping. They-- the same day, they just told us they were closing operations. They didn't give us a reason. They didn't give us-- they didn't work with us. They didn't give us a heads-up. They just shut it down.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:47.46" data-timestamp="347.46"> Which brings us to why Adama's here, where her kids are with her parents at home, sleeping. If she weren't here, this bus that's arriving from Texas would drop off a few dozen people in this alley between 41st and 42nd Street. A couple National Guardsmen would sleepily emerge from the car they're sitting in across the street and hand out an address to go to and a map. And they'd have to make their way there on their own.</p><p begin="00:06:10.89" data-timestamp="370.89">The address is for the Roosevelt Hotel, which the city has set up as the intake center for migrants arriving in New York. 20-minute walk from here, right through the center of Times Square.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:06:21.06" data-timestamp="381.06"> So we're here to welcome them, and then actually safely send them there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:25.71" data-timestamp="385.71"> Adama's organization partnered with another organization to hire a bus.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:06:27.84" data-timestamp="387.84"> So what I'm going to do is put them in the bus and send them straight to the Roosevelt, and tell them, please give them food right now. And then, they will give them sandwiches and water. Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:38.83" data-timestamp="398.83"> The other thing she's going to do is get on the bus and give them a little speech. The bus driver will translate to Spanish. The speech is partly practical. She gives out a phone number they type in their cell phones for somebody they can call once they're in a shelter, to direct them to the services they need.</p><p begin="00:06:54.94" data-timestamp="414.94">But also, she's doing this herself, the head of the organization in the middle of the night, bus after bus, because she thinks it's important that somebody says "welcome," just in some basic human way, to people who have come so far, full of worry and fear and hope.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:07:10.09" data-timestamp="430.09"> So as a former asylum seeker, I didn't get that welcome party. My parents didn't get that welcome party. So I am doing it for them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:18.56" data-timestamp="438.56"> But the thing you say is-- just so I understand, so the thing you're going to say is what? Give me the speech.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:07:23.66" data-timestamp="443.66"> So the first step is "Bienvenidos a Nueva York. You are in New York City, in Manhattan, in Port Authority. We want to welcome you. We're going to count you, and we're going to put you in another bus and transport you to Roosevelt Hotel, where there's a bathroom, there's water, there's food, and there's Wi-Fi." The Wi-Fi always gets them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:44.72" data-timestamp="464.72"> She tells them that her organization can help with clothing and legal aid and anything else they need help with.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:07:49.77" data-timestamp="469.77"> And then we tell them, listen, this is a country of immigrants. I am an immigrant. I am from Africa. I am from Guinea. I'm an immigrant just like you.</p><p begin="00:07:59.45" data-timestamp="479.45">I made it, and you will make it. It's not easy in the beginning, but it will get better. You're welcome here. No matter what anybody tells you, you have rights. Practice those rights. If you don't know what they are, we will tell you what they are. And then, we let them out.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:23.42" data-timestamp="503.42"> OK, time check-- what time is it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:08:25.58" data-timestamp="505.58"> 11:50. It should be pulling up. Do you want a peppermint? No?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:30.02" data-timestamp="510.02"> Yeah, yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:08:30.84" data-timestamp="510.84"> Oh. Here you go.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:32.38" data-timestamp="512.38"> Thanks.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:08:33.96" data-timestamp="513.96"> We've been standing in the cold for over an hour. Random people walk up to Adama to start conversations or ask for directions. She just seems like the kind of person you can do that with. At around quarter past midnight, she reveals something that I can't believe I'm learning after standing there so long together.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:08:49.46" data-timestamp="529.46"> I have my pajamas on. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:52.46" data-timestamp="532.46"> (LAUGHING) What?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:08:54.08" data-timestamp="534.08"> This is my pajamas.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:55.91" data-timestamp="535.91"> Are you serious?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:08:56.53" data-timestamp="536.53"> I am.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:57.59" data-timestamp="537.59"> Oh, my god. It's true. Those are checked, teal-and-navy pajamas.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:09:01.88" data-timestamp="541.88"> I know. And I was like, ah, I don't feel like dressing up.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:06.63" data-timestamp="546.63"> OK, so you're wearing a maroon coat and teal-and-navy pajamas, dark-blue hijab, backpack--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:09:14.78" data-timestamp="554.78"> I'm ready to walk the runway. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:17.45" data-timestamp="557.45"> Exactly.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:09:19.46" data-timestamp="559.46"> Finally, more than an hour after that, 1:30 in the morning, the bus from Texas rolls up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:09:25.37" data-timestamp="565.37"> OK. You cannot go inside, so you just have to wait here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:29.93" data-timestamp="569.93"> The bus door opens. She climbs the steps and stands at the front of the bus and makes her speech, which does the job. When everybody emerges from the bus after their three-day ride, they are not the exhausted, huddled masses that I expected they'd be. People are beaming, excited.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:09:47.53" data-timestamp="587.53"> Hola, bienvenidas. Fila por favor.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:50.45" data-timestamp="590.45"> Some carry suitcases. Some carry plastic garbage bags filled with their stuff. In my terrible high-school Spanish, I ask where they're from. And families look so happy when they answer.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:00.08" data-timestamp="600.08"> De donde viene?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Speaker 1</h4><p begin="00:10:01.13" data-timestamp="601.13"> Venezuela.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Speaker 2</h4><p begin="00:10:02.09" data-timestamp="602.09"> Venezuela.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:02.81" data-timestamp="602.81"> Venezuela?

It's a dangerous trip for many of them through the Darien Gap. Most are from Venezuela, a lot of Colombia. Plus, one family where the dad proudly shouted his answer like, I don't know about these people, but I definitely belong here.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:27.74" data-timestamp="627.74"> De donde?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Speaker 9</h4><p begin="00:10:28.53" data-timestamp="628.53"> De Mexico! Viva Mexico!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:30.86" data-timestamp="630.86"> That guy has family in New York, who are on their way to come pick him up. Most everybody else got into the other bus Adama arranged and headed over to the migrant welcome center at the Roosevelt Hotel, a once-glamorous 1,000-room behemoth that fills a block of 45th Street, a place where, back in the day, you might spot JFK or Eisenhower or Guy Lombardo, that is now the city's new Ellis Island, the entrance point.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:10:53.30" data-timestamp="653.3"> Salida por favor.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:55.29" data-timestamp="655.29"> Adama guides everyone off the bus into the lobby.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:10:57.78" data-timestamp="657.78"> Hola. Entra. Entra por favor. Familia?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:04.38" data-timestamp="664.38"> How much Spanish do you speak now?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:11:06.03" data-timestamp="666.03"> None. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:08.13" data-timestamp="668.13"> The welcome center at the Roosevelt Hotel is one part of the city's response. It's pretty well run. They have legal services to help you apply for asylum. There are free diapers and warm food.</p><p begin="00:11:16.77" data-timestamp="676.77">They'll replace your meds. The city started doing this when a kid showed up whose meds for epilepsy had been seized by border patrol. And from here, they'll send you to one of the over 200 shelters around the city, which are mostly not as nice as this.</p><p begin="00:11:29.04" data-timestamp="689.04">Some are in school gymnasiums, office buildings. If you have family elsewhere in the country, there's a desk here where New York City will happily buy you a plane ticket to go live with them and not be New York's problem anymore. 1/4 of the arrivals take that option.</p><p begin="00:11:43.68" data-timestamp="703.68">As this year ends, New York City is entering some new phase with this massive experiment at welcoming and providing services for so many new arrivals. It's put some 20,000 kids into schools. It's housing right now 60,000 migrants.</p><p begin="00:11:58.50" data-timestamp="718.5">Though in lots of ways, it has not gone so well, it hasn't put newcomers on a path to jobs and places to live. But has any American city ever done this much for new arrivals on this scale? Mayor Adams has pointed out some cities do nothing. Texas, Governor Abbott, does nothing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Eric Adams</h4><p begin="00:12:16.34" data-timestamp="736.34"> I was on the border in El Paso! I saw what happened with people and children and families sleeping in airports, sleeping on the street! So don't critique what we've done! Don't tell us how we could have done it better!</p><p begin="00:12:32.08" data-timestamp="752.08">Our hearts are big, but our resources are not endless. The way goes New York goes America. And if we don't get it right in New York City, we're not going to get it right in America.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:51.43" data-timestamp="771.43"> Today on our show, we look at a city desperately trying to prove that it can be the sanctuary city it thinks it is. We look at the messy, flawed, generous, impossible, vast New York migrant experiment, how it's going, where it works, and where it fails so badly that people have accused New York of deliberately doing horribly so immigrants decide not to stay in the city, what it's like to arrive here and make your way right now in New York. From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> Stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

Shut it down!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:13:48.01" data-timestamp="828.01"> Send them back home!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Protesters</h4><p begin="00:13:50.47" data-timestamp="830.47"> Shut it down!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:52.30" data-timestamp="832.3"> This is Staten Island, living up to every stereotype New Yorkers have about Staten Island when a migrant shelter got put there. There have also been protests in Brooklyn and Queens. With that in mind, the city opened up a new facility a month ago that the mayor said was chosen to be, quote, "the least intrusive as possible to current residents, while also being as humane as possible to migrants."</p><p begin="00:14:12.81" data-timestamp="852.81">It is not in a building. It's four massive tents that, together, can house 2,000 people at a place called Floyd Bennett Field. One of our producers, Valerie Kipnis, visited right after it opened.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Valerie Kipnis</h4><p begin="00:14:26.67" data-timestamp="866.67"> When I first heard that Floyd Bennett Field was going to be the city's newest migrant center, it struck me, because I knew exactly where it was-- in the middle of nowhere. And I can say that with some degree of certainty, because I grew up in the same middle of nowhere-- or at least close by.</p><p begin="00:14:42.87" data-timestamp="882.87">It's called Floyd Bennett Field. But to me, it's always been the abandoned airport, slash place with the massive ice hockey rink, slash random chunk of land you pass just before Rockaway Beach. It's right on the water. There's not a lot of streetlights or ways to get there, unless you're in a car or on a bike.</p><p begin="00:14:57.36" data-timestamp="897.36">And if you're driving around at night, it feels like you're in the middle of the woods, not New York City. I wondered what it was like to get sent there as someone brand new to the city. So I went out with Jika Gonzalez. She's a reporter I've worked with before, who covers immigration.</p><p begin="00:15:13.87" data-timestamp="913.87">We arrived at around dusk. There was the faint glow of cop cars near a massive encampment lit up by fluorescent lights. And there were the tents, surrounded by a giant metal fence and security guards.</p><p begin="00:15:25.90" data-timestamp="925.9">Jika and I arrived unannounced, hoping to talk to people hanging out around the shelter. But that night was actually so cold that there was basically no one outside, except for this one group of adults with some kids. The kids wore blankets over their heads, trailing on the ground behind them, cute, but cold, like little ghosts. And actually, they were on their way out, in a rush.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jika Gonzalez</h4><p begin="00:15:47.35" data-timestamp="947.35"> Hola, que tal?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Valerie Kipnis</h4><p begin="00:15:48.91" data-timestamp="948.91"> Why are you leaving here right now?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jika Gonzalez</h4><p begin="00:15:50.23" data-timestamp="950.23"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rafael</h4><p begin="00:15:52.27" data-timestamp="952.27"> Nos estamos yendo de nuevo a la 45.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jika Gonzalez</h4><p begin="00:15:54.13" data-timestamp="954.13"> Trying to go to 45th Street.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Child</h4><p begin="00:15:55.75" data-timestamp="955.75"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Valerie Kipnis</h4><p begin="00:15:56.98" data-timestamp="956.98"> What's on 45th Street?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jika Gonzalez</h4><p begin="00:15:58.23" data-timestamp="958.23"> Qué hay en la</p><p begin="00:15:59.57" data-timestamp="959.57">45?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Child</h4><p begin="00:16:00.82" data-timestamp="960.82"> El hotel.

She rocks back and forth from heel to toe as she talks.</p><p begin="00:16:19.59" data-timestamp="979.59">Her family arrived here only a few hours ago.

It's a campsite," says one of the men, "where we're all sleeping on cots. And we need our privacy for the kids. You understand? And the bathrooms-- they're not in the main tent. You have to go outside to use them."</p><p begin="00:16:52.90" data-timestamp="1012.9">Sometime along the way, they began to wonder about public transportation. How are the kids going to get to school from here? The closest train station is over 4 miles away. Rafael, Karlina's dad, is like, how will I find work from here?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rafael</h4><p begin="00:17:07.18" data-timestamp="1027.18"> Entonces por una de esas cosas que nosotros buscamos refugio aquí para luego nosotros empezar a trabajar.

That way, we can rent a house and take care of our expenses, you understand? They told us we were coming to a hotel, but then suddenly, when we were on the way here, we realized that this is like a desert, an island in the middle of nowhere."</p><p begin="00:17:32.95" data-timestamp="1052.95">The city says it shows people photos of the tents and maps of where they'll be going. But I later talked to other people here, and no one I spoke to had been shown photos. Lots of them were surprised when they arrived.</p><p begin="00:17:44.41" data-timestamp="1064.41">Karlina, her dad, Rafael, and the whole family, basically, as soon as they arrived, started thinking, we can't stay here. There has to be something else. Rafael seemed determined. He wanted to talk to the person who assigned them here, someone at the Roosevelt Hotel on 45th Street. They needed to get back.</p><p begin="00:18:09.54" data-timestamp="1089.54">This group-- turns out there are two families from Venezuela, the capital, Caracas. A mom named Daniela, her husband Rafael, also her brother Roni and his family, and two other guys who they met along the way. Consider their journey up to this point, the one that got them to these giant tents in the middle of an abandoned airfield.</p><p begin="00:18:29.34" data-timestamp="1109.34">They left Caracas in late summer, and for three months, made their way through Central America to Mexico, to Piedras Negras, and then into Texas. After they crossed, they were offered a choice of three buses-- Chicago, Denver, or New York. They knew Venezuelans in New York City who said they could get help here, that the kids could go to school, that the adults could find work. So they chose New York.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniela</h4><p begin="00:18:51.60" data-timestamp="1131.6"> Decidimos venirnos para acá, pero resulta que aquí ahora nos salieron con otra cosa.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Valerie Kipnis</h4><p begin="00:18:55.80" data-timestamp="1135.8"> Daniela, Karli's mom, says they were told they'd get a place to live for two months. "We could rest and look for work to move forward, you understand? So we decided to come to New York, because we'd get help here. But here, it is something else. Here has been confusing."</p><p begin="00:19:12.29" data-timestamp="1152.29">You arrive at the Roosevelt Hotel in the middle of the city, with a warm lobby, the breakfast, the bag check, the shelter assignment, the moment of stillness after months of chaos. And then, you get put on this bus, and it starts driving you away from the place you've been imagining, away from all the skyscrapers.</p><p begin="00:19:28.46" data-timestamp="1168.46">And suddenly, you're in this other place, far away from the crowds of Grand Central. And then, you get off the bus, and you're processed in a place that looks very much like a tent. Because it is a tent. It is something else.</p><p begin="00:19:47.66" data-timestamp="1187.66">So the family had decided to leave and somehow try to make it back to 45th Street. The only way out seemed to be a city bus in a kind of parking lot. The neon sign scrolling across its front read "not in service." There was a man nearby in a Transit Authority uniform with a walkie talkie who seemed stressed out by the whole situation.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bus Driver</h4><p begin="00:20:09.76" data-timestamp="1209.76"> I got, like, 15 people here that wants to get on the bus, but none of them speak English.

I cannot go off route, right?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Valerie Kipnis</h4><p begin="00:20:17.71" data-timestamp="1217.71"> While he's talking, he starts walking towards the parked bus. So the group decides they better follow him. They have almost no belongings, just a few plastic bags of stuff. The kids run ahead.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Children</h4><p begin="00:20:29.67" data-timestamp="1229.67"> Bye! Bye! Bye-bye!

They look exhausted, sleepy. The adults have no idea what's going on, where the bus is going or anything. They crowd near the entrance of the bus.</p><p begin="00:20:46.88" data-timestamp="1246.88">There's another bus driver already on board. The bus driver with the walkie talkie gets on as well. Neither of them speak Spanish. It falls to Jika to translate for them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jika Gonzalez</h4><p begin="00:20:57.08" data-timestamp="1257.08"> Sir?

I later learned that this is a new bus the city set up to shuttle people from the shelter to a subway station. But at this moment, in the first days of the shelter's operation, the driver seems a bit unsure about where he's going. He starts looking through his paperwork.</p><p begin="00:21:21.20" data-timestamp="1281.2">Yes, Coney Island. Coney Island is not near 45th Street in the center of Manhattan. It's in the opposite direction.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bus Driver</h4><p begin="00:21:30.24" data-timestamp="1290.24"> So it's going to Coney Island by the train.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Valerie Kipnis</h4><p begin="00:21:32.27" data-timestamp="1292.27"> So you're only taking them to the train station?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bus Driver</h4><p begin="00:21:35.39" data-timestamp="1295.39"> Correct.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Valerie Kipnis</h4><p begin="00:21:36.74" data-timestamp="1296.74"> What if they want to go to the-- I think they're trying to go to the Roosevelt Hotel on 45th Street.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bus Driver</h4><p begin="00:21:41.75" data-timestamp="1301.75"> I can't go off route.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Valerie Kipnis</h4><p begin="00:21:43.55" data-timestamp="1303.55"> Oh.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bus Driver</h4><p begin="00:21:43.79" data-timestamp="1303.79"> That's my instructions.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jika Gonzalez</h4><p begin="00:21:45.26" data-timestamp="1305.26"> I'm going to translate for them, is that OK?

She's like, you're in a part of New York that is called Brooklyn, and where you're trying to go is Manhattan. It's two different counties. They're called boroughs here.</p><p begin="00:22:08.15" data-timestamp="1328.15">They ask Jika, how are we supposed to transfer or pay for a train? We just got to the city. We have no money. The family keeps asking to go to 45th Street, the same way they got here, and the driver keeps repeating he can't go off route, that he can only take them to Coney Island, nowhere near where they want to go.</p><p begin="00:22:25.46" data-timestamp="1345.46">The bus driver with the walkie talkie steps out, takes a call, and then comes back. Says maybe he could find someone at the subway station to help the family out. But it'll be a long trip, a bus ride to Coney Island, then, like, an hour on the subway back to 42nd Street.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jika Gonzalez</h4><p begin="00:22:42.71" data-timestamp="1362.71"> They're just skeptical about if anybody's actually going to help them or not, because they feel like they were already not really helped, and that nobody speaks Spanish, and that it's very confusing.

"They did that to us already." Walkie talkie dude goes out again and comes back with a solution. He's found a dispatcher at Coney Island who speaks Spanish.

You can see the adults start to relax a little. So maybe it'll work out? It's as if the entire system relies on the kindness of strangers, as if it works by coincidence, not design, coincidence that someone here speaks Spanish to translate, coincidence that the bus driver is kind and willing to find a Spanish speaker at the next point in their journey. Hopefully, that guy can help them get on the train to 42nd Street. And hopefully, at that station, someone can direct them to the hotel. For Roni, it all seemed like a very long way to get back to where they had just been.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roni</h4><p begin="00:24:10.64" data-timestamp="1450.64"> Como que dice nos mintieron o nos mandaron acá como con un cómo va un como con una cabaña?

He had an empty space that he rented to Shakrood and two of his friends-- not a real apartment, more like a basement-- two rooms and a bathroom for $1,600 a month, around $500 a person.</p><p begin="00:29:41.31" data-timestamp="1781.31">Their first night in the new place-- the three of them had been so excited to finally have their own spot that they stayed up all night, talking about how to make it perfect. They decided to get a special tea set from Mauritania. All of this is basically what the city wants-- for people to find their way out of the shelters and out into the world.</p><p begin="00:30:00.76" data-timestamp="1800.76">But once you do that, there's rent to pay. And Shakrood can't legally work, because he's an asylum seeker. And asylum seekers have to wait 150 days after they file for asylum, before they can even apply for working permission. This specific waiting period was invented by the federal government in the '90s to discourage people from using asylum claims as a way to get work authorization.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:30:24.79" data-timestamp="1824.79"> What do you think of that system?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Shakrood</h4><p begin="00:30:28.33" data-timestamp="1828.33"> Yeah, it's, uh-- like-- it's-- there is no big deal, because they-- every country has stuff to do with--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:30:40.41" data-timestamp="1840.41"> These rules?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Shakrood</h4><p begin="00:30:41.20" data-timestamp="1841.2"> Yeah.

Like, we cannot help all these people get on their feet if you let them into the country but then don't let them work for six months. Because Shakrood can't get a job legally, he's had to look for one under the table.</p><p begin="00:31:07.05" data-timestamp="1867.05">He started right when he first got here in August. He didn't have any connections in New York, so his initial strategy was this. He just got up one day and started walking in and out of stores and restaurants, asking for work, all over the city.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Shakrood</h4><p begin="00:31:22.24" data-timestamp="1882.24"> I go to the Queens, Brooklyn, someplace-- I don't know even its name.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:31:27.99" data-timestamp="1887.99"> Maybe the Bronx?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Shakrood</h4><p begin="00:31:28.83" data-timestamp="1888.83"> Yeah.

After that, he had a month where he was just kind of adrift, staying in the shelter, spending his days riding the subway with a friend, getting off at random stops.</p><p begin="00:34:17.13" data-timestamp="2057.13">He also had a brief diversion into dating, which he told me about kind of bashfully and proudly at the same time.

But there's a whole shadow market of accounts available. Shakrood met some kind of account dealer outside the TD Bank at 37th Street and Broadway one day, paid him $150 for an account that was supposed to be active for two weeks. He got kicked off after two days.</p><p begin="00:36:32.69" data-timestamp="2192.69">Later on, a friend helped him find an Uber Eats account.

He said he was going to high school and had a job at a supermarket, called Western Beef.</p><p begin="00:42:26.70" data-timestamp="2546.7">But he said he would come to Times Square three times a week, every single week, stay for hours.

  <h3>Act Four: The New Kids</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:46:47.23" data-timestamp="2807.23"> Act 4, The New Kids.</p><p begin="00:46:49.12" data-timestamp="2809.12"></p><p begin="00:46:49.46" data-timestamp="2809.46"></p><p begin="00:46:49.63" data-timestamp="2809.63"></p><p begin="00:46:49.72" data-timestamp="2809.72"></p><p begin="00:46:49.81" data-timestamp="2809.81"></p><p begin="00:46:50.15" data-timestamp="2810.15">So there are 20,000 of these new migrant kids enrolled in New York City schools at the start of the school year. And which schools they arrived in was kind of random. That was true last year, too.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:47:00.37" data-timestamp="2820.37"> I would say we went from like September to December with no students. And then all of a sudden it was January. It's like, oh, you're getting these students.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:47:06.25" data-timestamp="2826.25"> This is a school counselor at a middle school. He asked that we not name it. The school is about 350 students, so on the small side, and pretty diverse.</p><p begin="00:47:14.82" data-timestamp="2834.82">And one day, this guidance counselor heard that some of the new migrant kids had been crying and hiding in the bathroom. And the counselor doesn't speak Spanish. The kids don't speak English.</p><p begin="00:47:23.91" data-timestamp="2843.91">They had these traumatic experiences coming to the United States. And he couldn't even talk to them about it. He felt like he was failing his students.</p><p begin="00:47:31.65" data-timestamp="2851.65">In the end, like so many people on today's show, he just had to kind of jury-rigg something himself to deal with the problem. He found a couple of Spanish-speaking grad students who were studying counseling, and had them come by. And they did a handful of counseling sessions with the new students.</p><p begin="00:47:45.63" data-timestamp="2865.63">In these counseling sessions, a kind of surprising thing happened. Some kids, yeah, wanted to talk about their journeys. But that was not the big thing they were interested in discussing.</p><p begin="00:47:55.14" data-timestamp="2875.14">The thing they really wanted to talk about was middle school. There are 11-year-olds, 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds. And they're just trying to figure out the same stuff any middle schooler might.</p><p begin="00:48:06.29" data-timestamp="2886.29">So one of our producers, Aviva DeKornfeld went to this middle school to spend a day talking to kids about what it is like to settle in a New York City middle school. She talked to three of them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:48:16.47" data-timestamp="2896.47"> The first kid I met was Celynnys. She was in an English language class, 1 of about 20 kids sitting in neat little rows. Celynnys is the tiniest one in class. She sits in the back row with front-row posture. She's a total Hermione Granger; very organized, loves knowing the right answer to a teacher's question.</p><p begin="00:48:36.26" data-timestamp="2916.26">She came to the US knowing a little English already. But most of the other migrant students don't speak any English at all, so they're constantly asking Celynnys for help in class, which she has mixed feelings about.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Celynnys</h4><p begin="00:48:48.34" data-timestamp="2928.34"> Porque es como Selene hace esto. Celynnys y me ayudas en esto. Yo ayudo en tareas a todas mis amigas las explico porque no me gusta, la verdad. Como les digo, soy una persona responsable, no me gusta que me copien la tarea. Yo les digo como haz diferente, aunque sea las palabras Y que no quiero hacer. A veces me harto y digo como ya déjenme en paz.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:49:07.31" data-timestamp="2947.31"> It's like, Celynnys, do this for me. Celynnys, help me with that. I helped them all with homework because I don't like them just copying my work. I tell them to at least write it differently. And sometimes, I just get fed up with helping and tell them to leave me alone.</p><p begin="00:49:21.98" data-timestamp="2961.98">The reason all these kids keep asking Celynnys for help is because the school only has eight Spanish-speaking adults to help translate for 45 kids, none of whom speak even conversational English. So lots of kids just sit through class after class without a clue about what's going on. The school does have an ENL class, English as a New Language, though the teacher doesn't speak Spanish.</p><p begin="00:49:47.15" data-timestamp="2987.15">The thing Celynnys wanted to talk to me about was her grades. She's stressed about them. Back in Ecuador, Celynnys was the top student, best in her class five years in a row.</p><p begin="00:49:58.13" data-timestamp="2998.13">Here, she says she's doing pretty well except for in humanities and math. Humanities is hard because there's just so much talking in that class, all in English. It's hard to keep up. And math is difficult because the vocab is all weird, like the teacher will start talking about fractions.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Celynnys</h4><p begin="00:50:17.37" data-timestamp="3017.37"> Pues yo no sé, digo qué fracción es una palabra, es algo de matemáticas o que es eso? Y ella nos explican y digo pero de qué me estás explicando si no entiendo?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:50:27.45" data-timestamp="3027.45"> It's hard to know if the word the teacher is saying-- in this case, fraction-- is a word in English that she just doesn't know yet or if it's a new word for everyone, even the English speakers. She's worried the teachers don't realize how much harder it is for the migrant kids trying to learn in a foreign language.</p><p begin="00:50:44.86" data-timestamp="3044.86">I talked to a school counselor about this. And he said the teachers definitely do realize that and take that into account. They're planning to grade the kids on a curve, weighing participation much more than they normally do, which sounds like a kindness in the short term, but not a real solution.</p><p begin="00:51:09.21" data-timestamp="3069.21">So much of successfully navigating middle school has nothing to do with what you learn in a classroom. Celynnys told me that there are all kinds of things she's having to figure out about being a middle schooler here like rules. There are so many more rules here.</p><p begin="00:51:25.07" data-timestamp="3085.07">Celynnys, perhaps unsurprisingly, is a fan of rules. But figuring out what's considered right and wrong, that's been a bit of a learning curve. Like the other day, she was playing with her friend, but then got sent to detention for being too rough.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Celynnys</h4><p begin="00:51:39.95" data-timestamp="3099.95"> Pero en sí nunca nos lastimamos porque siempre jugamos así, brusco, porque allá estamos como ya entendido de que es un juego y que es bromeando y nunca nos peleamos por eso.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:51:53.60" data-timestamp="3113.6"> She says that she and her friends always play roughly, and so they never get hurt. They understand it's a game. I ask her if her teachers understood that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Celynnys</h4><p begin="00:52:01.57" data-timestamp="3121.57"> Sí, entienden que están jugando, pero dijeron que de igual manera no lo debíamos de hacer.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:52:06.35" data-timestamp="3126.35"> They understand that we're playing, but said that we still shouldn't play that way. I asked one of the Spanish-speaking teachers who knows Celynnys well about this incident. She said the principal showed her the security footage of the girls. And it was clear to her that they were playing, though she could see why it would look alarming to the principal.</p><p begin="00:52:25.17" data-timestamp="3145.17">I asked Celynnys if she often found herself breaking rules simply because she didn't understand them. And she said, well, sometimes she understands the rules fine, but just wants to play like she used to.</p><p begin="00:52:43.35" data-timestamp="3163.35">The second girl I talked to was Soffia. And by that I mean, she talked to me. She was very set on talking to me because she had a lot to say all at once, like how she liked science class because her teacher has a lizard.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Soffia</h4><p begin="00:52:55.65" data-timestamp="3175.65"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:52:56.61" data-timestamp="3176.61"> And how she wants to be an actress or maybe a veterinarian.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Soffia</h4><p begin="00:52:59.37" data-timestamp="3179.37"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:53:00.72" data-timestamp="3180.72"> And how her favorite word to say in English is water. She likes how it sounds.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Soffia</h4><p begin="00:53:04.40" data-timestamp="3184.4"> Water.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:53:05.55" data-timestamp="3185.55"> I think school is going OK for her. It was a little hard to tell. She pinballed from subject to subject. Everything just seemed to fall under the category of things I'd like to share, even how hard it was to come to the US from Ecuador.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Soffia</h4><p begin="00:53:19.78" data-timestamp="3199.78"> Primero, empezamos a cruzar la selva y ahí nos quedamos sin comida. Osea, no comimos dos días.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:53:27.60" data-timestamp="3207.6"> Soffia and her family didn't eat for two days. In the same breath, she'll tell me about how scared she was that her family might get robbed, and also how cool it is that New York City looks just like it did in the movie <i>King</i> <i>Kong.</i></p><p begin="00:53:41.13" data-timestamp="3221.13">Other kids did this, too. It was this very weird dissonance talking to them because they're so excited to tell you about themselves, but they've also lived through real hardship. So they're clamoring over one another, all simultaneously trying to tell me about devastating experiences in these chirpy little voices. They just want to share whatever it is, heavy or light, like it all has equal weight.</p><p begin="00:54:14.56" data-timestamp="3254.56">The last girl I talked to was named Marianny. I wanted to meet her because a teacher mentioned she was putting together a dance for all the girls. Marianny's gawky, carries herself like a baby giraffe, except for when she's dancing, which she's often doing. She tells me that after school, she likes to listen to music and dance while she cleans her room. And recently, one afternoon, she had an idea.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marianny</h4><p begin="00:54:39.42" data-timestamp="3279.42"> Cuando estaba bailando yo digo: ay, pero es que tengo como unas ganas de bailar, que.. que todo el mundo vea mi baile.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:54:47.22" data-timestamp="3287.22"> I was dancing. And I was like, I want everyone to see my dance. She decided to choreograph something for the girls to perform during the winter dance. It seemed like a good bonding opportunity.</p><p begin="00:54:58.44" data-timestamp="3298.44">She'd come up with the idea shortly after a spat over some candy with some other girls. The kids often argue about food. Just the other day, the librarian had to intervene in an altercation involving a Cup-a-Noodles.</p><p begin="00:55:12.68" data-timestamp="3312.68">Marianny wanted to do something about all the fighting. So she came up with a solution straight out of Disney Channel. Let's make a dance to bring everyone together.</p><p begin="00:55:22.19" data-timestamp="3322.19">She invited the rest of the girls to participate. Nearly 20 of them wanted in, which is a big deal for Marianny because she used to hate school back in Venezuela. Got bullied terribly. But here, in some ways, she finds it's easier to make friends because all the migrant kids are stuck together.</p><p begin="00:55:45.74" data-timestamp="3345.74">Today is the first rehearsal. We all head downstairs where Marianny is going to teach everyone the dance. The room is a real dance studio with mirrors and a ballet bar.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marianny</h4><p begin="00:55:55.00" data-timestamp="3355"> Hola, vamos a bailar!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:55:57.05" data-timestamp="3357.05"> Everyone's in their socks. Marianny gets right to it, walking them through the steps.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marianny</h4><p begin="00:56:01.36" data-timestamp="3361.36"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:56:06.23" data-timestamp="3366.23"> The dance is exactly what you'd imagine a middle school girl might choreograph in her bedroom. It was nice to see the kids in this setting where there was room for all their personalities. Soffia is running around, bouncing off the walls. Celynnys, the little Hermione Granger, wanted to know the exact count of all the moves. And since she had gone to a ballet academy back in Ecuador and had some experience with performing, insisted on making this announcement.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Celynnys</h4><p begin="00:56:36.94" data-timestamp="3396.94"> Si la musica se para, tienen que seguir bailando.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:56:40.14" data-timestamp="3400.14"> If during the performance the music stops for some reason, just keep dancing. Good advice, if a little premature. They've barely learned the choreography.</p><p begin="00:56:50.46" data-timestamp="3410.46">Marianny, for her part, honestly just seemed happy to be included, even though this whole thing was her idea in the first place. There were some disagreements about how to do the dance.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Students</h4><p begin="00:57:00.60" data-timestamp="3420.6"> Si es! Caracho!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:57:04.56" data-timestamp="3424.56"> But mostly, things went fine. And during breaks, the girls rolled around on the floor, did cartwheels, precariously hung off the ballet bar. A few played a high-speed game of ring around the rosy. One of the older girls helped a few of the younger ones practice the steps. It was total chaos, the good kind.</p><p begin="00:57:25.48" data-timestamp="3445.48">But hanging over all of this is the fact that for a lot of migrant families in New York City, there's a deadline approaching. The city recently told families that they only have shelter for 60 days. Then they'll have to reapply, some as soon as the first week of January. A new shelter could mean a new school entirely. Whatever solidness the girls feel now might be gone by the new year.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:58.59" data-timestamp="3478.59"> Aviva DeKornfeld is a producer on our show.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act 5: Harlem Shuffle (podcast only)</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:58:06.41" data-timestamp="3486.41"> Act 5, Harlem Shuffle.</p><p begin="00:58:09.52" data-timestamp="3489.52">So once migrants get into the shelters that New York is providing, lots of them have no idea what they're supposed to do next or who to talk to. In theory, they all have case managers. But often, they have no idea who those case managers are. And the case managers are overwhelmed, anyway, with lots of cases.</p><p begin="00:58:24.77" data-timestamp="3504.77">So there are all kinds of nonprofits trying to fill the gaps. One of them is run by Adama Bah, the woman who I was with till 2:00 in the morning at the Port Authority greeting a bus from Texas. Again, her group is called Afrikana. Emmanuel Dzotsi dropped by there to see how much of the city's slack they're able to take up and where they're struggling. Here he is.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emmanuel Dzotsi</h4><p begin="00:58:44.74" data-timestamp="3524.74"> Afrikana is in a nondescript building in Harlem at 145th and Lenox. Most of the windows are boarded up. There's no signage. The only reason I knew I was in the right place was because when I pulled up at 10:00 AM, there was a long line of people that trailed out the front door, around the building, and into a parking lot.</p><p begin="00:59:04.72" data-timestamp="3544.72">Inside, there's a small waiting area, a long table with three people doing intake, a series of makeshift cubicles. It looks basically like a tiny, chaotic DMV, the sort of place where if you stand around for too long, someone will pull you into a random task that they need help with. It could be translating, copying papers, or, in my case, holding someone's toddler for a second.</p><p begin="00:59:27.80" data-timestamp="3567.8">Hi. You want to do my job for me?</p><p begin="00:59:30.71" data-timestamp="3570.71">[BABY JABBERING]</p><p begin="00:59:32.99" data-timestamp="3572.99"></p><p begin="00:59:33.59" data-timestamp="3573.59">Overseeing everything is Adama Bah. She started this place seven months ago after years of helping immigrants and asylum seekers out of her car. So many people needed her services, she needed an office. Now, she says they get roughly 500 people a day.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:59:49.43" data-timestamp="3589.43"> We don't advertise this location because of the volume that we get.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Emmanuel Dzotsi</h4><p begin="00:59:53.25" data-timestamp="3593.25"> So how do people know to come here?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:59:56.72" data-timestamp="3596.72"> Word of mouth.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Emmanuel Dzotsi</h4><p begin="00:59:58.25" data-timestamp="3598.25"> Purely?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="00:59:59.18" data-timestamp="3599.18"> Word of mouth.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emmanuel Dzotsi</h4><p begin="01:00:00.56" data-timestamp="3600.56"> She founded this place to serve a new generation of migrants from places like Guinea and Mauritania who've been making their way to the United States in the last couple of years. Those people started coming in large numbers this summer in part because of a Nicaraguan government's decision to change their visa system. So Africans could just fly to Nicaragua, and from there, walk and hitchhike to the United States. You no longer had to pass through the often-lethal Darien Gap connecting Colombia and Panama. Word spread on social media about it. And lots of people came.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="01:00:33.14" data-timestamp="3633.14"> If you notice when you look around the room, it's mostly Black migrants, right? It is the one place where they get people that look like them that are giving them direct services. Everywhere they go, we're turned away. There's no one who's going above and beyond to translate if they don't speak the language. But everyone here speaks that language.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emmanuel Dzotsi</h4><p begin="01:00:49.37" data-timestamp="3649.37"> Languages like Pulaar and Wolof, but also Arabic and French. And everybody providing those services is a volunteer, including Adama. She's not getting paid for any of this.</p><p begin="01:01:02.27" data-timestamp="3662.27">To make money, she has a part-time job. And it seems like she's just about making all of this work, which is wild because most of her time I was at Afrikana, I found myself thinking, what would happen if this place didn't exist?</p><p begin="01:01:17.06" data-timestamp="3677.06">I watched person after person come in to inquire about an important piece of mail they had forwarded to Afrikana, because with all of the moving they were doing from shelter to shelter, this was their permanent mailing address. I met a woman who'd had a baby just a week earlier who was limping around the office, stitches and all, because she just wanted to be around other people from her country. And in the middle of this, I saw Adama digging through crates looking for mail, calming disputes.</p><p begin="01:01:44.87" data-timestamp="3704.87">She seemed unable to get through a quick Zoom call at her desk without someone who'd been helped days earlier popping by to give her an update or needing more guidance. I watched her constantly, and I mean, constantly lose track of her phone because she'd given it to volunteers who'd learned long ago that if you need something from a shelter manager or an attorney or anyone useful, it'll happen just that much faster if they think Adama Bah is calling.</p><p begin="01:02:13.10" data-timestamp="3733.1">Trying to keep up with her, I kept looking for discrete ways to tell her that I could really use a minute to catch my breath. But there are no breaks, she says, not when she's helping all of these people.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Emmanuel Dzotsi</h4><p begin="01:02:24.23" data-timestamp="3744.23"> I have a random question for you, which is a simple one. When do you like-- when do you eat?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="01:02:29.27" data-timestamp="3749.27"> I'm eating now. I have a peppermint. I don't eat because they're not eating. So I'm so embarrassed to eat in front of them. So I'd rather chew gum and a peppermint.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Emmanuel Dzotsi</h4><p begin="01:02:39.14" data-timestamp="3759.14"> You wait until you get home?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adama Bah</h4><p begin="01:02:40.64" data-timestamp="3760.64"> Unfortunately, yeah. I'm surprised I'm not skinny. [LAUGHING] Follow me. Next spot.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emmanuel Dzotsi</h4><p begin="01:02:47.23" data-timestamp="3767.23"> Adama's biggest challenge today is 27 young men, aged 18 through 21 here in the US without their parents. Today, Adama wants to find them all housing. And she's trying to get them into what she says is the gold standard here.</p><p begin="01:03:02.98" data-timestamp="3782.98">Instead of regular migrant shelters, she wants to get them placed in the city's youth shelter system. That system serves all young New Yorkers aged 16 through 21 without homes, not just migrants. And in the youth shelter system, you could potentially get a spot for up to two years, not just 30 days. You also get vocational training, mental health services, and help finding schools, which are all services these kids would rarely get in the regular migrant shelters.</p><p begin="01:03:31.81" data-timestamp="3811.81">It's going to be hard for Adama to place all 27 boys, though, because a lot of the youth shelters are full. Most of the boys know that they could be in for a bit of a wait, so they spread out around the room lounging. Almost everyone is on their phones watching soccer and talking to people back home.</p><p begin="01:03:55.80" data-timestamp="3835.8">One guy, though, who isn't on his phone is a 19-year-old named Lamine. He's the one person who asks me straight up, who are you exactly? Do you work with immigration?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lamine</h4><p begin="01:04:07.01" data-timestamp="3847.01"> [SPEAKING FRENCH]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Emmanuel Dzotsi</h4><p begin="01:04:11.17" data-timestamp="3851.17"> No, no, [SPEAKING FRENCH]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="01:04:16.50" data-timestamp="3856.5"> I speak French because I lived in Belgium for a few years as a kid. Never picked up the word for podcast, though. And as I struggle to remember if I can just say podcast, I can feel Lamine sizing me up, wondering if I can be helpful to him in any way. He figures out quickly that I probably can't. But he's still happy to talk with me.</p><p begin="01:04:37.44" data-timestamp="3877.44">He explains that he's from Guinea. Says both of his parents are dead. And a couple of years ago after a coup d'etat in his country, the one parental figure in his life, a military officer who'd more or less adopted him, went missing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lamine</h4><p begin="01:04:51.69" data-timestamp="3891.69"> [SPEAKING FRENCH]</p><p begin="01:04:56.79" data-timestamp="3896.79"></p><p begin="01:04:57.25" data-timestamp="3897.25"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="01:04:57.33" data-timestamp="3897.33"> It shocked me. I don't know if he was just in prison or if he's dead. I don't know. I don't know. All of it pushed me to leave the country because back there, my life wasn't guaranteed.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emmanuel Dzotsi</h4><p begin="01:05:09.28" data-timestamp="3909.28"> Luckily, Lamine says he knew someone who knew someone who could help get him out, which, I should add, always seems to be a thing for Lamine. He just has this knack for seeking out the right people for help. And there's an earnestness about him, I think, that wins them over.</p><p begin="01:05:25.01" data-timestamp="3925.01">That's how he found his first shelter in New York from a random stranger on the street. And it's how he heard about Afrikana. Lamine showed me his Facebook page. There's this video of him at the airport in Texas.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lamine</h4><p begin="01:05:37.57" data-timestamp="3937.57"> [SPEAKING FRENCH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emmanuel Dzotsi</h4><p begin="01:05:39.91" data-timestamp="3939.91"> It's kind of his I've made it to America video. He looks sheepish, almost embarrassed in it. But he is so incredibly happy.</p><p begin="01:05:48.67" data-timestamp="3948.67">He looks legitimately really young, younger somehow than the Lamine in front of me. What a difference three weeks makes. Now that he's in New York, he doesn't really talk to people back home. And he feels guilty about that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lamine</h4><p begin="01:06:06.70" data-timestamp="3966.7"> [SPEAKING FRENCH]</p><p begin="01:06:09.49" data-timestamp="3969.49"></p><p begin="01:06:09.82" data-timestamp="3969.82"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="01:06:09.93" data-timestamp="3969.93"> I got rid of my African number on WhatsApp. I got an American number so I could forget.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emmanuel Dzotsi</h4><p begin="01:06:15.65" data-timestamp="3975.65"> Lamine doesn't want to think about his life in Guinea.

They'll think they can change their lives, that everything will change. But it's the opposite. I can't tell someone in my country to come here if you're not in big danger.</p><p begin="01:06:36.73" data-timestamp="3996.73">If you're in danger, OK, because here in the US there is security. But here, being undocumented is not easy. It's not easy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lamine</h4><p begin="01:06:45.49" data-timestamp="4005.49"> [SPEAKING FRENCH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emmanuel Dzotsi</h4><p begin="01:06:48.97" data-timestamp="4008.97"> Right now, he's in a shelter, a big tent facility on Randall's Island next to Manhattan. But in just two weeks, he'll run up against the city's 30-day limit. That's actually why he's here at Afrikana. He's trying to figure out where to go next.</p><p begin="01:07:12.34" data-timestamp="4032.34">As the day goes on, the 27 young men are getting restless. So far, Adama has only managed to find places for just two of these guys at a shelter called Covenant House. She says it's one of the best in the city.</p><p begin="01:07:25.27" data-timestamp="4045.27">It's not until 7:30, almost 10 hours after I arrived at Afrikana, that one of the volunteers who's been helping out Adama all day hears back from a place she's been waiting on. This organization will take kids. But she tells the boys, there's a catch.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="01:07:41.02" data-timestamp="4061.02"> [SPEAKING FRENCH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emmanuel Dzotsi</h4><p begin="01:07:44.77" data-timestamp="4064.77"> Only 16 people can go, she says. She reads out 16 names. Lamine is not on that list. He looks upset. He's going to have to come back in the morning and try all of this all over again. I tell him I'll catch up with him later. And I follow the 16 kids out the door.</p><p begin="01:08:05.27" data-timestamp="4085.27">Those young men have one last task sitting between them and this day finally being over. They have to make a roughly 30-minute walk to where they'll be staying. All right, let's go. I start walking with them, only to realize that we have a couple of stragglers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="01:08:21.29" data-timestamp="4101.29"> They are coming. Hey, hey, hey, we leave.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emmanuel Dzotsi</h4><p begin="01:08:25.31" data-timestamp="4105.31"> And then it dawns on me. Me and these youth were both given the address. But I'm the one with Google Maps pulled up. I'm not following these youth to their next living situation. I'm taking them there.</p><p begin="01:08:38.48" data-timestamp="4118.48">It's a little chaotic. A few of them charge ahead, moving like they know where they're going even though they don't, and acting kind of insultingly like they're not with me. I watch one of them try to jaywalk and almost go headfirst into oncoming traffic.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Emmanuel Dzotsi</h4><p begin="01:08:52.07" data-timestamp="4132.07"> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. wait.

I ring the doorbell of the place. And one of the teenagers, the same one I yanked back from traffic earlier, taps me on the shoulder and asks me, you're going to wait with us, right? See how it is?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Emmanuel Dzotsi</h4><p begin="01:09:18.08" data-timestamp="4158.08"> I won't leave you guys.

I feel terrible communicating this to the boys. This is not going to be their new home. And every day, they have to clear out of here from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM.</p><p begin="01:10:02.56" data-timestamp="4202.56">One of her boys mouths to me, [SPEAKING FRENCH], it's crazy. I don't know what to tell him. I kind of agree.</p><p begin="01:10:11.20" data-timestamp="4211.2">I thought that when I went to Afrikana, I'd be taking a look at a sort of safety net under the city's safety net, a place that was catching all these people the city maybe wasn't. But that safety net has holes in it. For all the work Adama and her volunteers put in, it feels like it all comes down to luck.</p><p begin="01:10:37.19" data-timestamp="4237.19">In the weeks that followed, I got texts and calls from a couple of the boys. They told me that they hadn't gotten placed in a long-term youth facility, that instead, they doubled down on staying in the city's regular migrant shelters.</p><p begin="01:10:50.99" data-timestamp="4250.99">Adama told me it used to be easier to place young people. I happened to be there in late October, right when it started to become almost impossible. The youth shelter system is full.</p><p begin="01:11:03.05" data-timestamp="4263.05">For weeks, I didn't hear anything from Lamine. But when I did get in touch with him, he told me he's staying at Covenant House, the big youth shelter Adama says is one of the best. He says he got the address off someone he met that day at Afrikana, and he took it from there. I got in here myself, he told me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lamine</h4><p begin="01:11:20.87" data-timestamp="4280.87"> [SPEAKING FRENCH]</p><p begin="01:11:25.00" data-timestamp="4285"></p><p begin="01:11:25.46" data-timestamp="4285.46"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="01:11:25.60" data-timestamp="4285.6"> Every day at 6:00 AM, I got up to go to Covenant House to ask if they have a place.

That was her goal when she first opened Afrikana. She'd help folks, and they'd be gone because she'd have connected them to the right people.
