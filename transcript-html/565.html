  <h3>Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.61" data-timestamp="0.61">One of my coworkers here at <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>, Robyn, was visiting New Orleans two years ago on a family vacation. And they had never been to New Orleans before. And they took one of those bus tours of the city-- you know, where it would show you the sights and the French Quarter. And then there was some, you know, look at this telephone pole. You can see the mark for how high the water got during Hurricane Katrina.</p><p begin="00:00:19.82" data-timestamp="19.82">The tour guide was an older black man, a local. She said he was really good. And there's this one moment during the tour that really stuck out. It was late in the tour. They're driving to the Lower Ninth Ward.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:00:29.91" data-timestamp="29.91">And as we were coming toward it, our tour bus guide says, so look. We used to go down into this area,  the Lower Ninth Ward. It was really badly hit in the storm. You know that. But we stopped going down there because we learned that the people there just really-- they didn't like the tours.</p><p begin="00:00:49.13" data-timestamp="49.13">They don't like the tours. They don't want people to come in and look at them and stare at them and look at how bad it is. And so we're not going to go in there.</p><p begin="00:01:00.58" data-timestamp="60.58">And it stuck with me. I just believed that he was saying something that meant something to him. It seemed like he was saying something sincere, like we don't do this, and we're not doing it for the right reason. And so I'll show you some other stuff. But this is off-limits.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:15.53" data-timestamp="75.53">The tour guide may have been sincere. But in addition, it's illegal for tour buses to go into the Lower Ninth Ward. The city council made it illegal starting in 2006, because buses were in the way of cleanup crews. But the rule was widely ignored till 2012, when homeowners went to the city council to finally get it enforced.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gwen Adams</h4><p begin="00:01:33.51" data-timestamp="93.51">It really made me angry. I felt as if you're looking at me through an eye that says, oh, look, there's another little animal in the zoo.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:45.57" data-timestamp="105.57">Gwen Adams is one of the homeowners who went to the city council about the bus tours. Kim Ford's another homeowner.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kim Ford</h4><p begin="00:01:50.97" data-timestamp="110.97">I'm not saying that they will come in here to gawk at people, no. I don't think there's anything mean spirited about it at all. I think they have a genuine interest to want to know how are the people doing, what's going on with them. I get that. But guess what? That's not the way you do that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:12.06" data-timestamp="132.06">It was just so impersonal, people say. That's part of what felt so weird.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jamal Preston</h4><p begin="00:02:16.48" data-timestamp="136.48">Back when I was in school, like, every day I look outside, there's like a tour bus coming through. And there's like 50, 60 people on the bus-- the big, air-conditioned, super comfortable ones. You would never see who was on the buses, because they wouldn't get off. They just come through, and then leave.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:33.69" data-timestamp="153.69">This is Jamal Preston. He's 18, just graduated high school. His family returned to the Lower Ninth two years after Katrina.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jamal Preston</h4><p begin="00:02:40.54" data-timestamp="160.54">Like they're coming through just for the sake of, like, oh, look at how terrible-- sympathy, aw. But your sympathy is because something bad happened to people. Your sympathy is not based on the people that you actually met in the neighborhood that had to deal with it. It's a whole different level.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:59.36" data-timestamp="179.36">The 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina is this month. You probably heard that. There's been a ton of coverage-- remembering what happened, and stories about the rebuilding. But the Lower Ninth, this place that the bus tour will not take you into, is a special case, because this is the part of the city that was not supposed to come back.</p><p begin="00:03:17.74" data-timestamp="197.74">You remember this, right after the storm? City officials said, forget it. Don't get anybody back there. The mayor's planning commission wanted to turn it to green space, basically a public park.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:27.61" data-timestamp="207.61">And when they decided to not make it a green space?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Henry Irvin</h4><p begin="00:03:30.80" data-timestamp="210.8">I guess, well, then-- excuse my French-- but enough hell was raised, they figured they better do something different.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:35.93" data-timestamp="215.93">This is Henry Irvin, one of the hell raisers, 79-year-old who's been called the mayor of the Lower Ninth by New Orleans' actual mayor.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Henry Irvin</h4><p begin="00:03:43.56" data-timestamp="223.56">And then a lot of people started coming back. And then the city put in a lot of stumbling blocks too, see.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:52.67" data-timestamp="232.67">Investigative reporter Gary Rivlin did a nice summary of those stumbling blocks recently. The Lower Ninth was the last neighborhood in the city to get electricity and drinking water. Residents were allowed back months after they were allowed into other neighborhoods. FEMA trailers were slower to arrive here. Only one school was reopened, and that only happened after teachers and parents cut the padlock on the building and marched on the superintendent's office.</p><p begin="00:04:14.30" data-timestamp="254.3">Meanwhile, money allocated for homeowners to rebuild their houses-- $10 billion of assistance for Katrina victims throughout Louisiana was distributed by the state in a way that discriminated against black homeowners. That's what a federal judge ruled in 2010. And it's black homeowners who are in the Lower Ninth. Because of all this, most people did not come back.</p><p begin="00:04:32.90" data-timestamp="272.9">The population of the ward is a little less than half of what it was before the storm. So half the homes are back. And they're bunched up at the bottom end of the ward, the high ground near the Mississippi, with bit patches of nothing in the top half, where Mr. Irvin lives.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Henry Irvin</h4><p begin="00:04:47.36" data-timestamp="287.36">They started working on that house. This house has been totally repaired. This house, they haven't done anything on it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:56.41" data-timestamp="296.41">And are they going to tear that down? They're going to be able to [INAUDIBLE].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Henry Irvin</h4><p begin="00:04:58.68" data-timestamp="298.68">[INAUDIBLE].</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:00.07" data-timestamp="300.07">I'd seen pictures of the Lower Ninth Ward-- probably you have, too. But they didn't prepare me for what it's like to drive around the north half of the ward, the part above North Claiborne Street. It's like wilderness. But it's a very orderly wilderness-- a grid of streets laid out like a town waiting for developers who never showed up-- which, you know, it is-- tall grass filling the space between lots.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Henry Irvin</h4><p begin="00:05:21.64" data-timestamp="321.64">So there was a grocery store here on this corner one time.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:24.92" data-timestamp="324.92">Now it's just a foundation there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Henry Irvin</h4><p begin="00:05:26.41" data-timestamp="326.41">It's just a foundation, that's all. This used to be [INAUDIBLE] school right here. It's just an empty piece of land.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:36.62" data-timestamp="336.62">Outside the Lower Ninth, in the rest of the city, the population is 90% back to what it was before the storm. Who you meet when you travel around the Lower Ninth are just some very willful people who've dealt with some of the worst destruction in the city and who are dealing with a lot of ghosts. It's still not clear exactly how many people in New Orleans died in Katrina. The official count is about 1,000, a third of those by drowning. More of those were in the Lower Ninth than any other neighborhood.</p><p begin="00:06:03.25" data-timestamp="363.25">Today on our program, we're going to take you on a walking tour of the Lower Ninth. We're going to make six stops. And at each stop, we're going to do what the bus tour cannot do. We're going to meet some people.</p><p begin="00:06:14.19" data-timestamp="374.19">And think about this for a second. This is the neighborhood that the city did not want to exist. This is the neighborhood that has come back the least from Katrina. So of all the extreme situations you could get into after the storm, these people have been in the most extreme. So what's that been like? Well, from WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. We find out. Stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

<div class="act" id="act1">
  <h3>Act 1: First Stop</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:45.92" data-timestamp="405.92">OK, so like I said, this is going to be a walking tour. And our first stop is going to be the northeast corner of St. Claude Avenue and Gordon Street. So face the street. Just to orient you real fast, the Lower Ninth is basically a rectangle with water on three sides of the rectangle. So as you stand here facing the street, the Mississippi is a few blocks in front of you. The bayou is a little ways behind you. And the Industrial Canal's to your right a bunch of blocks.</p><p begin="00:07:11.36" data-timestamp="431.36">It's all pretty close. The Lower Ninth is just 20 blocks wide-- just a little over a mile. And if you turn around now and you face this building on the corner, what you see is a two-story building. And the first story is faded brick. And those bricks were damaged during Katrina by rescue boats that knocked into it. A Wildlife and Fisheries guy told the current owner of this building 50 people were rescued from the balcony on the second floor.</p><p begin="00:07:32.97" data-timestamp="452.97">So back in the day, locals will tell you that this was a medical clinic. These days, it's a cafe-- well, more than a cafe. You see the hand lettered sign out front that lists red bean and rice special, ribs, computer service, VA benefits, seafood. And the guy that we're here to talk to is one of those people who has thrown his whole life now into trying to push the Lower Ninth into the future, Kirk Washington. Everybody just calls him Washington. Robyn spent a bunch of time with him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:07:58.97" data-timestamp="478.97">Washington is the least retired retired person I've ever met, thanks to Katrina. He opened this cafe.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Washington</h4><p begin="00:08:04.91" data-timestamp="484.91">Ah, it's [INAUDIBLE] in the cafe, baby.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:08:08.42" data-timestamp="488.42">Every day but Sunday, when the cafe's closed, he's here. Washington's a retired postal worker. He didn't know anything about running a cafe. After Katrina, he just saw that there was no place to send a fax or photocopy anything or look stuff up online, which you need to do with construction permits and home inspectors and FEMA and the city. So he thought, I'll build that.</p><p begin="00:08:32.67" data-timestamp="512.67">Then he kept going with other things they needed-- food, a game room with pool tables, a small clothing store, a recording studio. One day, I watched him help a resident apply for a home loan, rack a pool table for some kids, cook burgers and sandwiches for six people, and fax someone's proof of employment, all in under an hour. He also rents rooms to people for cheap-- he owns two houses-- so folks can afford to get back on their feet. He does all this for one reason.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Washington</h4><p begin="00:09:02.53" data-timestamp="542.53">To benefit the neighborhood, to bring the neighborhood back, you know.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:09:07.01" data-timestamp="547.01">Washington's lived in the Lower Ninth Ward since the late '70s. He bought his house in the '80s, bought the property next door to it too, fixed them both up. He stayed during Katrina because he's one of those people who always stays during a hurricane. An estimated 2,000 people in the Lower Ninth Ward decided to stay. 10 years later he thinks all the time about that decision to stay.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Washington</h4><p begin="00:09:29.31" data-timestamp="569.31">I've been all over the world. I've been all through Vietnam, everywhere. When that hurricane hit, I had never been that scared before in my whole life-- my whole life. I've been through a whole lot of things, scary, scary things, but that was as scared as I've ever been in my whole life.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:09:45.62" data-timestamp="585.62">Here's how Washington survived the storm. Sunday the 28th, the mayor orders the mandatory evacuation. That night, Washington is at home with three of his neighbors-- the Taylors from next door and Isaac from across the street. They plan on riding out the storm together.</p><p begin="00:10:05.33" data-timestamp="605.33">Early morning on the 29th the hurricane hits, winds over a hundred miles per hour. Washington calls the flying debris shrapnel, because it would kill you. At his house, the group isn't sure what to do.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Washington</h4><p begin="00:10:18.77" data-timestamp="618.77">I said, this is going to be dangerous, man. I said, y'all could stay if y'all want. But if y'all want to go, I think y'all should go and buckle down.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:10:26.24" data-timestamp="626.24">Everyone goes home. The levees fail. The entire Lower Ninth Ward floods.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Washington</h4><p begin="00:10:31.70" data-timestamp="631.7">All I could hear was this, when that water came. I could hear little babies howling and screaming. I could hear ladies hollering and screaming. I heard my neighbor hollering and screaming. The air was full of noise, people that was in dire need for someone to help them. I mean, people was really drowning. They were drowning.</p><p begin="00:10:58.43" data-timestamp="658.43">And, you know, there was nothing you could do. That was the hardest part about things. What can you do? I mean, you can't go out there, the wind is still-- you still have shrapnel flying all through the air. The water's rising so fast that, hey, you know, how are you going to negotiate the water?</p><p begin="00:11:14.48" data-timestamp="674.48">Yeah, I could swim. But guess what? I don't want to take no chances getting into the water. It was one thing that nobody should want to experience in their whole life.</p><p begin="00:11:30.67" data-timestamp="690.67">It got to the point that our neighbors, we started coming out to survey what was going on. Well, one of my neighbors drowned.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:11:41.23" data-timestamp="701.23">One of your friends who was in your house earlier that night?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Washington</h4><p begin="00:11:43.99" data-timestamp="703.99">Yes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:11:46.04" data-timestamp="706.04">That was Isaac. His full name was Isaac Castle. He was 58.</p><p begin="00:11:51.57" data-timestamp="711.57"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Washington</h4><p begin="00:11:52.73" data-timestamp="712.73">You feel you was a failure, you know what I'm saying? Because you could help, but you didn't. But it's the thing inside you that says, well, man, I could've did more than what I did. And it just kind of gets to you a little bit, because this person is gone, you know. And I didn't do anything about it. But I thought he was going to be safe. He couldn't swim. He couldn't swim.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:12:22.40" data-timestamp="742.4">Washington got picked up by a Wildlife and Fisheries boat and made his way to Baton Rouge. Two days after Katrina, he got himself to a Dodge dealership, figuring no matter what, he's going to need a car. And that's where, standing alone in a used car lot, exhausted, he started to feel something for the first time in days.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Washington</h4><p begin="00:12:42.92" data-timestamp="762.92">Of all the destruction and all the death and all the hollering and screaming, is just hit me. I mean, it was just like a whole three-story building just crushing me, like a tornado going around in my head. It was just like, wow, all these things have happened, and I'm just blinking my eyes and just seeing all of them at one time. It was just like a nightmare.</p><p begin="00:13:05.20" data-timestamp="785.2">I came to reality like, man, man, look. Did I go through all this? I'm really alive and this really did happen. You know what I'm saying? Everything that happened, everything that happened, this is real. This is real. It just hit me. It just hit me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:13:24.54" data-timestamp="804.54">What happened? You started crying?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Washington</h4><p begin="00:13:26.59" data-timestamp="806.59">Yeah. That was it. People, they was standing, watching. And they couldn't deal with it, so they went in the room. And they talk and talk and talk. And one of the guys came, after he saw me. I quieted down some.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:13:40.44" data-timestamp="820.44">The salesman?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Washington</h4><p begin="00:13:41.65" data-timestamp="821.65">Yeah. He said, man, I have a car for you. He said, you could get it right now. We're not going to charge you too much. So I pay in cash for the car. And I got  on the highway. It was just one thing after another.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:13:55.17" data-timestamp="835.17">He bought a white truck, drove it to Corpus Christi, Texas, and back home three weeks after the storm, during a time when most people weren't allowed back into the Lower Ninth Ward. Washington says his veterans ID card worked as a pass. And he rebuilt both his houses, one piece of sheet rock and one birchwood panel at a time.</p><p begin="00:14:20.37" data-timestamp="860.37">I spent a lot of time talking with Washington on three different days. And he never bragged or complained about anything. But I wanted to know what he lost in the storm, which is how I learned about the cars.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Washington</h4><p begin="00:14:31.18" data-timestamp="871.18">I lost a Mercedes Benz. I lost a Jaguar. I lost a BMW. I lost a Ford F-150.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:14:43.60" data-timestamp="883.6">He told me he got them right after he retired. He took his savings and bought them at auction, a car a year for four years. He got the last one just a year before the storm. He loved driving around in those cars. It was indulgent, after a life of saving money and working at the post office.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Washington</h4><p begin="00:15:01.92" data-timestamp="901.92">I don't talk about it that much. But when I get in my car, I'm sick as a dog, because I don't have these cars. I really don't want another one of those cars, because it's going to remind me, and I feel that I'm going to be more sicker than what I am.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:15:19.64" data-timestamp="919.64">You'll be more upset?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Washington</h4><p begin="00:15:20.67" data-timestamp="920.67">Yeah. Sick, sick to my stomach, like this thing in your stomach-- nerves, probably.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:15:27.40" data-timestamp="927.4">Your stomach hurts a lot?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Washington</h4><p begin="00:15:29.38" data-timestamp="929.38">It just has that little funny feeling. And when I get that funny feeling, I know it's something that's triggering it, and it's coming from my mind. It's coming from my head.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:15:42.22" data-timestamp="942.22">Here's the tangle for Washington. He's throwing all this energy into rebuilding and making everything new again. But all the new stuff that he has now, like his new bathroom and his new house, his new business, everything new reminds him of what was old, daily.</p><p begin="00:15:58.30" data-timestamp="958.3">Brushing his teeth with running water reminds him of when, after the storm, he couldn't do that. Turning on a light reminds him how for a while after the storm, he didn't have electricity. It doesn't stop, no matter how he tries to keep busy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Washington</h4><p begin="00:16:13.49" data-timestamp="973.49">I need things to do so that I won't get caught up in this mind thing, you know what I'm saying. So in order for me not to, I have to occupy my mind with something. I have to, because if I don't, my mind is going to play tricks on me. Do you daydream?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:16:34.78" data-timestamp="994.78">Sometimes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Washington</h4><p begin="00:16:35.72" data-timestamp="995.72">OK. I hate daydreaming. Do you have nightmares?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:16:42.34" data-timestamp="1002.34">Sometimes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Washington</h4><p begin="00:16:43.30" data-timestamp="1003.3">You see that? "Sometimes." It's constant. Do you have illusions of things while you're driving? Like you're driving your car, and you think that you driving this Mercedes Benz or this Jaguar? You see what I'm saying? I mean, I can't hide from it. It's real.</p><p begin="00:17:03.60" data-timestamp="1023.6">I know it's there. I know what the symptoms are. I know it's impossible for me to treat it. It's impossible, because daily things are going to bring me to it. Talking to you right now is bringing me to it.</p><p begin="00:17:24.15" data-timestamp="1044.15">I walk out the front of my house, and I look over at that door, I see my friend. I see Isaac. Then I have to let it go. Let it go. I come down this street. When I'm looking down from the bridge up there, I'm seeing nothing but the top of houses all water.

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:19:01.91" data-timestamp="1141.91">We're on a walking tour of the Lower Ninth this hour. Kirk Washington's house is all the way on the bottom of the Lower Ninth, right near the Mississippi. That's higher ground. That's the part of the Lower Ninth that survived the most. Houses are jammed together here, and most of them are occupied.</p><p begin="00:19:16.29" data-timestamp="1156.29">And just a two-minute walk from Washington's house, five blocks away, there's a bar that Kim Ford, who you heard at the top of the show, brought one of our producers, Zoe Chace to. She was like, go to this bar. It's the best.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:19:27.67" data-timestamp="1167.67">Call out the street name.

It looks well taken care of, which is not true of the street in front of it, you will notice if you turn that way. So many streets in the Lower Ninth are just awful, and this is one of them. Lots of potholes, and they're big potholes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kim Gordon</h4><p begin="00:20:19.06" data-timestamp="1219.06">And if you pull in there, you're going down in a hole.

  <h3>Act 3: Third Stop</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:30:10.83" data-timestamp="1810.83">It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Today on our program, we have a tour of the Lower Ninth Ward, the part of New Orleans that has come back the least since Hurricane Katrina hit 10 years ago this week.</p><p begin="00:30:20.46" data-timestamp="1820.46">We've arrived at the third stop at our tour, the corner of Jordan Avenue and North Prieur Street, right across from one of the levees that collapsed a decade ago. If you stand here facing south with the levee to your right-- well, first of all, this is the part of town where Brad Pitt bought a bunch of houses with the Make it Right Foundation after the storm. And you see some of those right in front of you. They're boxy and moderne. Lots of them have solar panels. There are also a couple of regular houses on the streets, some overgrown yards.</p><p begin="00:30:46.87" data-timestamp="1846.87">The levee itself across those houses has a grassy embankment with a 14-foot concrete wall at the top. And most people you talk to down here will tell you the same thing about what happened right here at this spot on the levee on August 29, 2005.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:31:01.10" data-timestamp="1861.1">It was dynamited in six places on the Industrial Canal. They got people that live on this street who will go to their grave and tell you that they heard the dynamite.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:31:10.32" data-timestamp="1870.32">And they heard an explosion, and then the water start coming up the streets. That's just to keep the water from going downtown, Bourbon Street. Because they didn't get no water. They just blew the damn thing and send it this way.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:25.17" data-timestamp="1885.17">Lots of people heard an explosion. And lots of people say it was the government. The government blew up the levees to get black people out of the Lower Ninth. Lucrece Phillips lived on the other side of the canal. And she said flooding had started that morning, but it wasn't much-- like as high as your car tires.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucrece Phillips</h4><p begin="00:31:40.50" data-timestamp="1900.5">Then all of a sudden we hear a boom, like the windows were sucked out. Now, we have them taped and all, so they just wanted to blast, but they couldn't. After the boom, then the water went from the tire of the car to the second floor so fast. I think they blew the levees and they redirected the water from downtown.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:32:12.85" data-timestamp="1932.85">In the last decade, there's been a ton of investigation into what caused this boom and what blew up the levees. The big official investigations did not find evidence of dynamite or of anybody blowing up the levees on purpose. So the question is, what made the boom?</p><p begin="00:32:26.20" data-timestamp="1946.2">Well, the consensus is that it was not one boom. There were lots of booms coming from a few different sources, like, for instance, when the levee on the north side of the Lower Ninth Ward cracked and toppled over at 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning of the storm. That would've made a huge boom, like a thick branch snapping in half, and then water would have rushed in. Other booms came from electrical transformers blowing up and from a massive barge that banged against the Industrial Canal levee later that morning, like somebody beating on a huge, empty steel trashcan one expert told me, till it came over the levee and landed in the Lower Ninth.</p><p begin="00:33:00.21" data-timestamp="1980.21">But it's also clear that people aren't crazy to believe the levees were dynamited by the government. They believe that for some very good reasons. For starters, the government's done it before.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Barry</h4><p begin="00:33:10.70" data-timestamp="1990.7">It is very real. It very much happened. And you combine that with the sound of the boom, and it's not surprising that that theory has life.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:33:24.65" data-timestamp="2004.65">John Barry has served on the levee board responsible for protecting New Orleans, the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority East. But he's a journalist. And before that, he wrote a great book called <i>Rising</i> <i>Tide</i>, about the 1927 flood that caused more devastation than Katrina did and that led city officials to decide that they were going to save downtown New Orleans by blowing up the levees in an area where poor people lived, a spot that's just a 20-minute drive from the Lower Ninth. All this with the consent of the governor, federal government, and the president.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Barry</h4><p begin="00:33:54.10" data-timestamp="2034.1">They had to promise to pay for reparations to everyone who was damaged. 95% of the people who ended up being flooded out by this dynamiting were white. But they had no political power. Many of them didn't speak English. They spoke an 18th century Spanish. They were referred to as Islenos. Most of them came from the Canary Islands. And it was dynamited.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:34:24.87" data-timestamp="2064.87">And it was kind of hard to do, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Barry</h4><p begin="00:34:27.91" data-timestamp="2067.91">It was very difficult to do. That was a very good levee.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:34:32.62" data-timestamp="2072.62">They just had to keep going back and blowing it up again and again.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Barry</h4><p begin="00:34:36.42" data-timestamp="2076.42">That's correct.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:34:38.43" data-timestamp="2078.43">How many people were displaced?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Barry</h4><p begin="00:34:41.58" data-timestamp="2081.58">Roughly 10,000.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:34:43.27" data-timestamp="2083.27">And did the government pay reparations?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Barry</h4><p begin="00:34:45.95" data-timestamp="2085.95">Well, it was the city of New Orleans that was supposed to pay the reparations. And the city pretty much stiffed everyone who they had made promises to.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:35:00.44" data-timestamp="2100.44">There's another good reason that people believe that the government wanted them out and blew up the levees to do it. Gwen Adams, who you heard at the beginning of the show, talked to me about this. It's a more immediate reason, a more personal reason.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gwen Adams</h4><p begin="00:35:11.92" data-timestamp="2111.92">It's so believable, because when people were interested in coming back to see what they needed to do in order to rebuild, they said, you can't do that, because we're going to green space this area. We wanted to come back and see what our property looked like. They held us off at gunpoint. When you attempted to get permits to rebuild, they fought you tooth and nail at City Hall with permitting for every little thing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:35:39.05" data-timestamp="2139.05">FEMA housing money was distributed with a formula that made it harder for families in the Lower Ninth to rebuild. City services, running water, schools arrived so much later in the Lower Ninth. In other words, it's the things that the city and state did after the flood that made the idea that the government just wanted everybody out, and it might have blown up the levees to achieve that, seem so very credible.</p></div>  </div>

It's an empty green lawn with a square of sidewalk in front. 23 years ago, Roy's family all came outside and wrote their names in wet cement.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roy Bradley</h4><p begin="00:37:26.89" data-timestamp="2246.89">This is my sister Veronica, my sister Kesie.

He has two houses here in the Lower Nine, bright blue, right next to each other. It was a big deal when he and his wife bought them-- 2001, not long before Katrina.</p><p begin="00:38:16.47" data-timestamp="2296.47">This was Roy's life plan, a classic life plan. Pay down the mortgage on both houses by renting out one of them. He worked two jobs, still does. He cooks at Mizado's at night and at TGI Friday's during the day. Once the mortgage was paid off, he and his wife Danielle would buy another place and rent out the starter homes to pay off that one.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roy Bradley</h4><p begin="00:38:36.91" data-timestamp="2316.91">These houses would help us pay for the next house, or the next step.

I'm going to go.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:39:26.47" data-timestamp="2366.47">Did you see some of your neighbors when you were driving out? And you were like, yo, let's go.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roy Bradley</h4><p begin="00:39:31.18" data-timestamp="2371.18">Oh, I seen a couple of them, man. And my neighbor at this corner here, at Gordon and El Dorado, he was washing the car. And he was washing the car. He was cleaning out the drains at the corner there, because we used to do that before the storm.</p><p begin="00:39:45.10" data-timestamp="2385.1">And I was like, man, you ain't leaving? You ain't going nowhere? Man, I ain't going. I ain't worried about no storm. You know how we do around here. And that actually was the last time I seen him. He didn't make it through. Wanda, his wife, told me that he drowned, that they was on top of the roof. And he had drowned before they got to the roof.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roy Bradley</h4><p begin="00:40:13.50" data-timestamp="2413.5">Roy estimates the number of neighbors he lost in the storm around 14. As we walk, he points out their houses, or where their houses were. There was a guy across the street who died right after the storm. He was running a generator, and his house burned up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roy Bradley</h4><p begin="00:40:28.35" data-timestamp="2428.35">He died, and burned in the house.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:40:29.99" data-timestamp="2429.99">The son of Danielle's pastor died, Roy says, when his house was dragged a few blocks away. The roofs here were filled with people during the storm. One of his neighbors even swam to Roy's house to look for him.</p><p begin="00:40:42.55" data-timestamp="2442.55">It took months before he was even allowed back onto this block. He had to show ID at the bridge. And then the National Guard gave him 30 minutes. You already know the house was totaled. Everything they had was gone.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roy Bradley</h4><p begin="00:40:55.36" data-timestamp="2455.36">My wife cried. She cried the whole time we was in the house. I thought it was gonna flood all over again in the house. [LAUGHS] I said, baby, you've got to stop.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:41:05.49" data-timestamp="2465.49">You didn't cry?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roy Bradley</h4><p begin="00:41:07.32" data-timestamp="2467.32">Well, seeing her cry, I might have dropped a tear or two. But I-- you know. [LAUGHS] Women, you know?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:41:14.74" data-timestamp="2474.74">He'll cry, though. He cried for an hour the night the Saints won the Super Bowl. Next, for Roy, the familiar beats of Katrina keep going -- 13 hour car ride to Baton Rouge, a year in Atlanta, then back to New Orleans and a FEMA trailer. No stores, no lights, nobody, no one around.</p><p begin="00:41:34.13" data-timestamp="2494.13">They got a little FEMA money, a little insurance money, and a whole bunch of free help from this nonprofit who set up shop right next to Roy's broken down home, lowernine.org. Two years after the storm, the family moved back in.</p><p begin="00:41:49.17" data-timestamp="2509.17">So picture right at this point in the story, it was like Roy was back where he was when he first bought his houses. It was a reset. Start at the bottom and climb back up. And this is the moment when Roy makes this totally fateful decision. He decides to take out a loan to borrow some money, fix up the other little house, which was a shell after Katrina; it was dry rotting, so he could start renting it again.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roy Bradley</h4><p begin="00:42:16.39" data-timestamp="2536.39">I put it on Facebook. That's what I did.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:42:19.07" data-timestamp="2539.07">What did you say?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roy Bradley</h4><p begin="00:42:19.65" data-timestamp="2539.65">I put it on Facebook. I'm trying to get a loan. Anyone knows someone that they can suggest to me to go to to get a loan. You get all these people, oh, yeah, yeah, [MUMBLING]. So that's when I went on to Loan Partners and took out the loan.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:42:33.60" data-timestamp="2553.6">Loan Partners.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roy Bradley</h4><p begin="00:42:34.23" data-timestamp="2554.23">[INAUDIBLE].</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:42:35.17" data-timestamp="2555.17">Loan Partners, the kind of company that made a lot of loans after Katrina to help with construction and rebuilding. And they lent Roy money for exactly that, to rebuild his rental property-- $60,000. But this was nothing like a typical mortgage loan. It had a very short deadline-- one year-- less, actually-- 11 months.</p><p begin="00:42:58.99" data-timestamp="2578.99">And it worked like this. For a year, you just pay interest every month. At the end, you pay off the whole thing, the original $60,000, all at once. I asked to see a copy. The rate seems high, 12 and 1/2%. And there are all sorts of hikes in fees that kick in if you're delinquent.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roy Bradley</h4><p begin="00:43:19.32" data-timestamp="2599.32">I didn't read all that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:43:21.84" data-timestamp="2601.84">These are really hard terms.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roy Bradley</h4><p begin="00:43:23.04" data-timestamp="2603.04">And I signed it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:43:25.08" data-timestamp="2605.08">Without really reading it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roy Bradley</h4><p begin="00:43:26.23" data-timestamp="2606.23">I didn't.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:43:28.53" data-timestamp="2608.53">Because why? You kind of trusted your friend, and they were like, this is a good company.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roy Bradley</h4><p begin="00:43:32.72" data-timestamp="2612.72">Right. That, and just to get my house fixed. That was my main goal is to get myself back on track to where I was before the storm hit.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:43:41.91" data-timestamp="2621.91">The only reason Roy was able to get this loan in the first place was because after Katrina, the government was handing out checks to homeowners to rebuild their houses. Loan Partners knew Roy would qualify for a bunch of this money as soon as he fixed up his rental property. And Roy did qualify. And the money did come.</p><p begin="00:44:01.38" data-timestamp="2641.38">But instead of paying off the loan all at once, he just kept sending those monthly payments. He thought it was like a mortgage, like the mortgages he'd been paying for years before the storm. Ray found out how big a mistake he'd made when he came home and he found this sign on his house.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:44:17.84" data-timestamp="2657.84">Can you read what it says?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roy Bradley</h4><p begin="00:44:19.63" data-timestamp="2659.63">"Five day notice to vacate the premises. First Civil Court of New Orleans states, February the 12th, 2015. Occupants--" I don't know when I became occupant in my house. "Owner wants possession." When have you became the owner? From Loan Partners?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:44:40.35" data-timestamp="2680.35">Here's the thing. Loan Partners does own Roy's house now-- both his houses. Roy didn't pay off his loan. The houses went into foreclosure, and Loan Partners got them. Roy and Danielle can't really believe this. They're challenging it in court and appealing the sale.</p><p begin="00:44:57.43" data-timestamp="2697.43">I talked to one of the guys at Loan Partners, Bob Bergeron. He said, no, their business isn't built through squeezing people through tough terms and then taking their property. Most of the people they've lent money to haven't defaulted, he says. And that seems to check out.</p><p begin="00:45:13.16" data-timestamp="2713.16">It's not such an unusual loan for a professional real estate investor. But it is for Roy, who is so far from where he thought he'd be at this moment-- close to losing his home for the second time in 10 years.</p><p begin="00:45:24.70" data-timestamp="2724.7"></p><p begin="00:45:24.96" data-timestamp="2724.96"></p><p begin="00:45:25.33" data-timestamp="2725.33"></p><p begin="00:45:25.70" data-timestamp="2725.7"></p><p begin="00:45:25.87" data-timestamp="2725.87"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roy Bradley</h4><p begin="00:45:26.18" data-timestamp="2726.18">To say that it's been 10 years, it should be better. You know, it's like I'm trying to get it back together, and now I'm back like I'm going back down this road. Then 10 years later, I shouldn't be there. I should be stepping to another step in life.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:45:41.81" data-timestamp="2741.81">There are so many lots for sale in the Lower Ninth Ward since the storm. And in Roy's neighborhood, people are buying them up, building new houses, then turning them around and selling them for a couple hundred thousand dollars just down the street from him. It's a fortune compared to what Roy paid 15 years ago.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:45:58.97" data-timestamp="2758.97">What do you think the neighborhood will be like in 10 years?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roy Bradley</h4><p begin="00:46:02.27" data-timestamp="2762.27">10 more years? Oh, all of us will be gone. Black homeowners, we'll be out of here. 10 more years-- this is just my theory of it-- they're going to be done kicked all of us out of here. And they're going to have these nice, big, pretty houses back here. You're going to have the street car come down through the middle.</p><p begin="00:46:17.56" data-timestamp="2777.56">And they're going to have the [INAUDIBLE] thing in the back on the levee.

  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:46:56.76" data-timestamp="2816.76">OK. We are at the fifth stop in our tour of the Lower Ninth, Royal Street. So you get on Royal Street and go as far east as it goes. Stop where it dead ends by that six-foot-high chain link fence. And as you stand here facing east, you can look through the fence and-- do that now-- you see the remains of the Holy Cross school. And you can see it was once a beautiful old southern school, three stories with columns and balconies and curved brick work, now left here basically to rot.</p><p begin="00:47:26.48" data-timestamp="2846.48">Look. The windows are boarded up. And there's a bright blue tarp on the roof that's ripping into shreds it's been up there so long. There's some kind of scary looking black mold that I think I see peeking through the bricks.</p><p begin="00:47:36.52" data-timestamp="2856.52">What you're looking at right now, believe it or not, is the site of one of the big gentrification fights in the Lower Ninth. This last year, a developer has been trying to build an upscale high-rise here-- condos, seven stories tall, hundreds of apartments and offices, a huge parking lot-- in a neighborhood-- again, look around. It's almost entirely family houses just one or two stories tall. And whether or not this gets built, newcomers are moving into this area, especially this part of the ward.</p><p begin="00:48:02.21" data-timestamp="2882.21">You remember Kirk Washington? Remember him, from the beginning of the show? He lives just a couple blocks from here. And across the street from him, a white couple moved in in his friend Isaac's old house. And he likes them. He likes them a lot, says hello.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neighbor</h4><p begin="00:48:15.87" data-timestamp="2895.87">How you doing?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Washington</h4><p begin="00:48:16.74" data-timestamp="2896.74">Doing fine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neighbor</h4><p begin="00:48:17.61" data-timestamp="2897.61">Hey, Mr. Wash, how are you doing?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Washington</h4><p begin="00:48:19.19" data-timestamp="2899.19">I'm fine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neighbor</h4><p begin="00:48:19.66" data-timestamp="2899.66">All right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Washington</h4><p begin="00:48:22.97" data-timestamp="2902.97">That's the house that Isaac-- he drowned right there in that house right there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:28.03" data-timestamp="2908.03">The couple going into the house are Simon Hand and his wife, Sarah DeBacher. She's active in the local neighborhood association, and popular enough that they elected her vice president, and then they elected her president. But it's complicated being, you know, sort of the face of the changing Lower Ninth. One of our producers, Sean Cole, talked to Sarah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:48:48.42" data-timestamp="2928.42">Even though she thinks about race-- her race-- all the time, Sarah DeBacher is still figuring out how to talk about it. She can have a hard time getting through a sentence without stopping to comment on what she's saying, like when I asked her why she moved to Lower Ninth Ward after the storm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Debacher</h4><p begin="00:49:03.21" data-timestamp="2943.21">Maybe some of it had to do with guilt and wanting-- god, this is sounding gross-- wanting to be part of helping in a meaningful way to rebuild.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:49:14.59" data-timestamp="2954.59">Which, on the one hand, is noble, of course. But on the other hand, in helping to rebuild a neighborhood that was 88% black before the hurricane, Sarah's worried she'll come across as some white savior asshole.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Debacher</h4><p begin="00:49:25.68" data-timestamp="2965.68">My role as ah, I don't even want to say "my role." Who I am as a white newcomer to the Lower Ninth Ward, that identity has been an uncomfortable one for me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:49:40.73" data-timestamp="2980.73">"Newcomer" should probably be in quotes. Sarah's lived in the Lower Ninth Ward since 2008, so about three years after the hurricane. Before that, Sarah and Simon were living upriver from the Lower Ninth in the Marigny neighborhood, next to the French Quarter. But when they decided to buy a house, the Marigny wasn't an option. Because after Katrina, it was suddenly totally unaffordable for them.</p><p begin="00:50:02.20" data-timestamp="3002.2">Katrina had a gentrifying effect on a lot of the city. First came the YURPS, or Young Urban Rebuilding Professionals. And after they helped put the city back together, another wave of entrepreneurs and tech workers and creative economy types came in. Sarah and Simon are both teachers. And the Lower Ninth Ward was more in their price range. Besides which, they liked it there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Debacher</h4><p begin="00:50:23.63" data-timestamp="3023.63">I don't want to romanticize some of the, like, "oh, because neighbors talk to each other." But I mean, that's part of it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:50:30.67" data-timestamp="3030.67">They actually started going to community meetings even before they moved to the Lower Ninth Ward. And ultimately, they bought a $50,000 double shotgun house, financed by an FHA loan for first-time homebuyers, and knocked out the middle wall that separated the two apartments.</p><p begin="00:50:46.04" data-timestamp="3046.04">As you're more than aware by now, people in the Lower Ninth Ward are friendly. And they were friendly to Sarah and her husband. But there was definitely a "what are you doing here" type vibe in the beginning, and even a few years in. She remembers this one night after her first son was born. It was late, maybe 11 o'clock. And these kids down the way started setting off fireworks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Debacher</h4><p begin="00:51:06.88" data-timestamp="3066.88">And my son had colic. And so, like, I was in the trenches with this baby who never stopped crying. And he was asleep. And then these fireworks started going off. And I went out in and first talked to the kids and just said, "hey, can you maybe do that another time?"</p><p begin="00:51:25.44" data-timestamp="3085.44">And then there was a voice from the porch. And she was like, if you have a problem, you can talk to me. You don't talk to my kids. And, you know, touche.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:51:35.06" data-timestamp="3095.06">That's fair.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Debacher</h4><p begin="00:51:35.84" data-timestamp="3095.84">That's fair.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:51:36.49" data-timestamp="3096.49">So Sarah says to her, look, you're a mom. I'm a mom. I've got this colicky baby. I'm going nuts. Can you please tell your kids to knock it off?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Debacher</h4><p begin="00:51:44.51" data-timestamp="3104.51">And she came off the porch and got in my face and said, you know, we didn't have any problems before you people moved in. We all minded our own business. And I was like, whoa. I really just need to sleep. I need just my baby to sleep. That's what this is about.</p><p begin="00:52:05.58" data-timestamp="3125.58">And she just wasn't hearing it. I mean, she was not hearing it. That conversation was about the changes in her neighborhood and anger about that. And at that moment, I was trying to make it about me. You know, like, can we be neighbors?</p><p begin="00:52:22.28" data-timestamp="3142.28">And I don't know. When I'm thinking about it now, I'm realizing that maybe my expectation that I would be able to diffuse that situation was coming from a little bit of a sense of entitlement. Like, why aren't you calming down?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:52:36.62" data-timestamp="3156.62">Right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Debacher</h4><p begin="00:52:37.30" data-timestamp="3157.3">But I recognize that that interaction was tied to who I am-- big W--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:52:47.07" data-timestamp="3167.07">Big W White person. But it's not just that Sarah's a white person in the Lower Ninth Ward. She's a community leader. When that interaction with her neighbor happened, Sarah was already vice president of her neighborhood association. And it's tricky to work on behalf of this largely African American community in a way that doesn't seem like she's saying, I know what's good for you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:53:08.73" data-timestamp="3188.73">Good afternoon, and thank you for coming. The public hearing before the city planning commission is now called to order.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:53:13.82" data-timestamp="3193.82">But this is how skewed and confusing the politics can get. That big condo complex that's been proposed in the Lower Ninth Ward? Sarah is one of the people spearheading the opposition to it. At a planning commission meeting last year, her neighbors applauded her before she even started talking. She cited specific zoning ordinances and showed slides.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Debacher</h4><p begin="00:53:32.02" data-timestamp="3212.02">I've been hearing again and again that the Lower Ninth Ward has to take what they can get. We do not believe that the Lower Ninth Ward has to take what we can get. In fact--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:53:41.37" data-timestamp="3221.37">But then one of the supporters of the project stood up, a guy who said he was born in the Lower Ninth and was around for Hurricane Betsy too, and that the area really needs a development like this one. And then he basically said the thing that Sarah's so concerned about all the time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:53:55.55" data-timestamp="3235.55">And you Johnny-come-lately people, y'all don't know about the Lower Ninth Ward. Y'all don't know anything about the Lower Ninth Ward.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:54:14.03" data-timestamp="3254.03">So for understandable reasons, Sarah wants to make sure she's being a neighbor in the right way. And she's actually checked in with folks, in a way that you never really encounter, to ask them point blank, am I doing this the right way?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Debacher</h4><p begin="00:54:27.61" data-timestamp="3267.61">You know, I came home last night and talked to a couple of my neighbors, Trina and Duane, about, like, what does this feel like for you, this 10 years later stuff? And how are you doing? And I was like, so what did you think when we moved here? What did you think? And Trina said, well, you know, Bud wanted to buy that house.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:54:53.65" data-timestamp="3293.65">Bud is Kirk Washington. Some people call him Bud. They also call him Wash and Washington. He has a lot of names.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Debacher</h4><p begin="00:54:59.64" data-timestamp="3299.64">And he just, I guess, didn't get it together in time or whatever. And so there was that. But we don't have a problem with you, Sarah, We don't have a problem with you. Which was interesting, because the implication there is that there are problems. Because there are.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:55:15.56" data-timestamp="3315.56">Do you feel like you're a part of the problem?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Debacher</h4><p begin="00:55:21.08" data-timestamp="3321.08">I don't know, man. In some ways, I don't feel like I really have control over that. That's a good question, right? But in some ways, I feel like, well, so what if I do or don't?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:55:34.58" data-timestamp="3334.58">It's really up to the people around her to make that call. And it's up to them whether to hold it against her that she wouldn't even be their neighbor if it weren't for this storm that upended all their lives.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Debacher</h4><p begin="00:55:47.97" data-timestamp="3347.97">My neighbor told me last night that the man who lived in our house-- and I knew this. I knew that someone had died in our house, although I didn't know when we bought the house. I really didn't. I mean, like, how naive can I be? It said one DOA, like, spray painted on the side of the house.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:56:07.31" data-timestamp="3367.31">Dead on arrival.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Debacher</h4><p begin="00:56:09.55" data-timestamp="3369.55">And then I went and talked to Washington. And Washington told me-- this is like why my neighbors are so dope, OK? So Washington told me the man who lived in our house that he had a bit of a drinking problem. And probably he just drank too much and fell asleep on the bed and the water just came up over his head. He told me that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:56:34.59" data-timestamp="3394.59">So just to clarify, this is what Kirk Washington said to Sarah at the time, seven years ago, when she first got to the neighborhood. He did not tell her what he told Robyn, about how his neighbor Isaac shouted for help and how he's haunted by that still.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Debacher</h4><p begin="00:56:48.93" data-timestamp="3408.93">And then last night, Trina told me the truth, which I'm not sure I can really utter without falling apart. But he didn't go quietly in his sleep.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:57:03.49" data-timestamp="3423.49">Even for people who weren't here for the storm, everything in the Lower Ninth Ward is attached to loss in some way. And the recovery has been so slow. And it's happening in a way that a lot of people here, including Sarah, didn't sign up for.</p><p begin="00:57:18.18" data-timestamp="3438.18">On the surface, it looks like the really typical story of gentrification. And as a country, we are terrible at that, at figuring out how to improve the neighborhood without fundamentally altering it and displacing the people who live there. There are always losers. But what's especially harsh here in the Lower Ninth is that this is happening in a place where so much loss has already come before it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:52.34" data-timestamp="3472.34">Sean Cole.</p></div>  </div>

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:58:02.36" data-timestamp="3482.36">We've arrived at the sixth stop, our last stop, on the tour of the Lower Ninth.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:58:06.22" data-timestamp="3486.22">Morning.

And there's some homes that look like Katrina just hit, like one house that scares the neighborhood kids that has possums living inside. In front of an abandoned lot, somebody's put up a basketball hoop.</p><p begin="00:58:23.16" data-timestamp="3503.16">And we talked to so many people in the Lower Ninth who are still so traumatized by what happened a decade ago that at some point, we just started looking for anybody who wasn't. That's how we ended up here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brishun Gary</h4><p begin="00:58:34.32" data-timestamp="3514.32">When I think about it, I just turn on the TV--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:58:36.16" data-timestamp="3516.16">You know what people do?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brishun Gary</h4><p begin="00:58:37.20" data-timestamp="3517.2">Shhh.

I'll be watching that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:58:47.93" data-timestamp="3527.93">Brishun Gary and his buddies talked to Zoe. They are 14, 13, and 11. And they do not remember the storm. Their big source of information, this film <i>Hurricane</i> <i>Season</i>, is a straight to DVD film about high school basketball players in the city after the storm. Needless to say, when these guys tell the story of the storm that destroyed their own neighborhood, it is without the pain you hear when adults tell it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brishun Gary</h4><p begin="00:59:09.60" data-timestamp="3549.6">Because my grandmother was with that. They was living through that. She said they lying down.

Because they were screaming. And then she was like, swish. And then the water just came on [INAUDIBLE]. The roof came off. [GROWL] So she said she couldn't get on top of the roof, so she got on top of her dresser.</p><p begin="00:59:32.59" data-timestamp="3572.59">And once she told me that, I'm like, man. I thought she was lying at first. So I started watching movies. And then I was like, oh, yes, must be true.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:59:38.66" data-timestamp="3578.66">What's interesting talking to kids about this is that some of the events that adults remember with horror, like being displaced to Texas or to Georgia, and all the difficulties in providing for their kids and finding housing and finding work, for the kids was sometimes just a very different experience.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Breyana</h4><p begin="00:59:54.06" data-timestamp="3594.06">It was so fun.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:59:55.78" data-timestamp="3595.78">Breyana was only two when her family fled the city for Texas.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Breyana</h4><p begin="00:59:59.01" data-timestamp="3599.01">Because I remember getting to spend time with my family. Because usually, you know your mom goes to work, and your grandma goes to work.

Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="01:00:45.42" data-timestamp="3645.42">Over on Gordon Street, between Burgundy and Rampart, Robyn ran into this 23-year-old, just, you know, on the street. And they started talking. And his name is Terrence Marshall. He went to Texas for a year after the storm. And then his family came back. And since then, he's found all of his old friends from when he was a little kid growing up here, from back when he was 13, except one of them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Terrence Marshall</h4><p begin="01:01:03.90" data-timestamp="3663.9">His name's Samuel.
