  <h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:10.00" data-timestamp="10"> From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. It's been such an extraordinary and painful few weeks since the killing of George Floyd. And we have a show today with people in scenes that we recorded this past week, trying to capture what this moment feels like and how different people are reacting and what they're doing.</p><p begin="00:00:29.38" data-timestamp="29.38">And I know usually right here at the top of the show, I jump right in with some story. But I think it actually captures what lots of people are feeling this week a lot better to start with this essay from one of our producers, Bim Adewunmi. Here she is.</p></div>  </div>
</div>
<div class="act" id="act1">
  <h3>Act One: Letter From America</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:00:46.25" data-timestamp="46.25"> The year I came to live and work in America, 962 people were shot and killed by police across the country. Or maybe the number was 1,093. It depends on who you ask about 2016. One project that counted the dead found that black males aged 15 to 34 were nine times more likely than other Americans to be killed by law enforcement.</p><p begin="00:01:10.09" data-timestamp="70.09">In case you've become fuzzy on timelines, Michael Brown was shot by police in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014. Walter Scott was shot in the back by police in Charleston, South Carolina in 2015. In 2016, Alton Sterling was killed by police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. And a day later, in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, police shot and killed Philando Castile, while he was in his car with his partner and her 4-year-old daughter.</p><p begin="00:01:38.11" data-timestamp="98.11">Those last two incidents were recorded. Both were viewed by the public at large. At the time Sterling and Castile were killed in 2016, I'd been living in New York for four months. I'd come to America to report on the presidential election campaigns with a wry British eye. I no longer have the original text of my visa application, but I remember distinctly that it mentioned both the 19th century French social scientist Alexis de Tocqueville and the late British journalist Alistair Cooke.</p><p begin="00:02:07.82" data-timestamp="127.82">Both Alexis and Alistair were men of letters, operating in very different eras of American upheaval. The aim of their writing was to help readers back home understand the unique American situation. They were good names to put on a visa application. It indicated I knew my literary lineage.</p><p begin="00:02:26.39" data-timestamp="146.39">But the reality is that beyond the common ground of our jobs, I wasn't really like Alexis or Alistair and moved through the world differently. I was a woman. I was a Muslim. I was a child of working class immigrants, born to parents who themselves were born in an African country still under the yoke of the English monarchy. And of course, I was black. I still am.</p><p begin="00:02:52.67" data-timestamp="172.67">Thanks to the spread of empire, I'm no stranger to the project of colonization. Of all the things I would be reporting on and experiencing firsthand in America, the subject of blackness was the thing with which I had the most literal, most lived experience. British police have historically not used guns like their American counterparts.</p><p begin="00:03:12.24" data-timestamp="192.24">But the history of disproportionate black deaths during and after interactions with police in the UK tells a familiar story. The lyrics are different, but the melody is old and known to me. That's the horrible thing about this moment. I've been here before.</p><p begin="00:03:30.29" data-timestamp="210.29">And so when George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis on Memorial Day in the last week of May, I had a feeling of resigned deja vu. Police had arrested a man, and then, less than a half hour later, that man was dead. The manner of it-- a cop's knee pressing down on his neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds-- felt like a stage play we'd all seen before. The fact that it had been recorded felt proper, like a sort of sacred practice.</p><p begin="00:04:01.23" data-timestamp="241.23">The mundane location of it was familiar, too-- a regular street suddenly transformed into an arena for public death. The echo of some of Floyd's dying words eerily the same as Eric Garner's in 2014-- I can't breathe. Even that felt like an on-the-nose rerun of a series called, How to Die in America.</p><p begin="00:04:23.02" data-timestamp="263.02">Almost every element of what happened next hit the exact beat it was supposed to. The video of his life being snuffed out went viral. Tabloid newspapers brought up his criminal past. Protests began the day after he was killed. Against police brutality, yes, but also against the organizing principle of colonialism in general, and explicitly against the ideology of white supremacy itself.</p><p begin="00:04:49.23" data-timestamp="289.23">And it wasn't just black people yelling. Things shifted. Something was different. By the end of the week, there were protests across the country-- all 50 states. And a week after that, there had been protests in other countries, too. Last weekend, I watched protesters in the west of England topple the statue of Edward Colston, a Bristol man who made his fortune by trading in thousands of enslaved Africans.</p><p begin="00:05:15.99" data-timestamp="315.99">After kneeling on the supine statue's neck, protesters rolled it down the street, before tipping it into the Bristol Harbour. My London friends sent me videos and photos of protests they had attended, while doing their best to maintain social distancing. As someone on Twitter put it, I can't believe corona blew a 28-3 lead to racism.</p><p begin="00:05:39.28" data-timestamp="339.28">The day after George Floyd was killed, I quit Twitter because of my propensity for doom scrolling. I knew my right thumb would be in constant, endless motion, eating up breaking news that would later crystallize into insomnia and migraines.</p><p begin="00:05:53.29" data-timestamp="353.29">But even on Instagram, it was a wall of George Floyd content. Suddenly, I was overwhelmed with graphics and photos and links to bail funds and that uniquely American habit-- crowdfunding. On pastel-colored digital easels, people wrote anti-racist quotes from Angela Davis and Ijeoma Oluo.</p><p begin="00:06:13.63" data-timestamp="373.63">Artists created tributes to people like 26-year-old Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her own home in Louisville, Kentucky back in March, and Tony McDade, a trans man killed in Tallahassee.</p><p begin="00:06:25.55" data-timestamp="385.55">There were guides on everything, from how to dress and prepare for a protest in the age of coronavirus to the specifics of raising truly anti-racist children. My favorite-- or least favorite-- genre of these is the one that teaches non-black people how to be people in this moment.</p><p begin="00:06:44.81" data-timestamp="404.81">Posts with headings like, "Here's what to say to your black friends," or, "Check in on your black friends," were seemingly everywhere. After that first weekend of protests, I got a text in one of my group chats from a black friend. "Have either of you gotten texts from white people this weekend," she wrote. "Yes," we both replied. We all shared a dark laugh.</p><p begin="00:07:08.40" data-timestamp="428.4">Black people have been dying in America and elsewhere for so long. What's so different about now? That first weekend, I kept asking myself this. What's making white people care now? I keep looking to see what I've missed. What was the thing that's making brands draw these lines now?</p><p begin="00:07:28.13" data-timestamp="448.13">What makes babynames.com dedicate its landing page to listing black victims of police violence, along with the note, "Each one of these names was somebody's baby. Babynames.com stands in solidarity with the black community."</p><p begin="00:07:43.50" data-timestamp="463.5">What is compelling people, a lot of them white, to stand up for the first time and proclaim that it's time to do something? How is it that I have read more proposals for defunding and abolishing the police in the last two weeks than over the course of the last two years? What's making people in small towns across America, from Lewistown, Montana to Bad Axe, Michigan, get up and protest now?</p><p begin="00:08:07.85" data-timestamp="487.85">If Sandra Bland didn't do it, if Eric Garner didn't do it, if Atatiana Jefferson didn't do it, if Aiyana Stanley-Jones didn't do it, how is the death of George Floyd the thing that moves the needle? I can't think of an easy answer.</p><p begin="00:08:25.15" data-timestamp="505.15">It's not because he was seven years old, like Aiyana Stanley-Jones was. It's not because he was a 12-year-old boy, like Tamir Rice was. It's not because he was an award-winning EMT who tweeted that 2020 would be her year, like Breonna Taylor was.</p><p begin="00:08:40.56" data-timestamp="520.56">So the next likely answer is that it's as simple as the effect of accumulation. Finally, there are enough dirty clothes in the hamper to justify putting on a load of laundry. Maybe the increased visibility of the stark differences between the haves and have-nots over the last few years has produced a populace ready to be pushed into the hitherto radical lane of thought that suggests, actually, black lives do matter. Maybe the activists finally broke through. Who can say?</p><p begin="00:09:10.92" data-timestamp="550.92">A part of me wants white people at large to feel deeply ashamed. This is entry level. Stop killing us. This is basic. If the killing of George Floyd could unleash this tidal wave of demonstration, what was stopping you before? He's as meaningful as any other victim of police violence, named or unnamed here today. You could have harnessed all this energy 15, 20, 200, 500, 1,000 deaths ago. But that didn't happen.</p><p begin="00:09:41.67" data-timestamp="581.67">And so when I ask the question, why now, the truth is that I don't really care. All these white people newly attuned to this frequency the rest of us know so well. I told a friend that I wanted everyone to do their belated learning far away from me.</p><p begin="00:09:58.76" data-timestamp="598.76">I don't want to see how anyone is carrying the one. I don't want to teach anyone. I have no office hours. I don't want to know what triggered your come to Jesus moment. I have no interest in seeing how the sausage gets made. I just want to rock up to the table and enjoy my breakfast.</p><p begin="00:10:16.25" data-timestamp="616.25">I know what's different for me. I'm angrier now. I think of what parents say about how their hearts grow bigger after a second child, instead of having to share the love they already feel. That's me. But instead of love, it's rage. I find that this time, I am furious. That's what's different.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:48.65" data-timestamp="648.65"> Bim Adewunmi is one of the producers of our show.</p><p begin="00:10:52.72" data-timestamp="652.72">[MUSIC - "BREATHING WHILE BLACK" BY MONONEON]</p><p begin="00:10:56.71" data-timestamp="656.71"></p><p begin="00:11:13.14" data-timestamp="673.14"></p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act Two: Before Sunrise</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:14.17" data-timestamp="674.17"> Act Two, Before Sunrise. So one night, recently, one of our producers, Diane Wu, stopped by Mr. Mango, which is a corner grocery in New York City. It's two or three blocks from the Barclays Center, where lots of the big New York City protests have happened. And it's just down the street from Brooklyn Hospital, which has been hard hit treating coronavirus patients in these last few months-- New York, of course, the epicenter of coronavirus cases in this country.</p><p begin="00:11:39.32" data-timestamp="699.32">Mr. Mango is a 24-hour grocery store that has stayed open through the city's shutdown, through the curfew. It is an intersection that all kinds of people pass through. And that particular night that Diane was there, protesters were singing "Happy Birthday" to Breonna Taylor at a little plaza across the street. A woman in scrubs at the store was FaceTiming somebody about onions. Cop cars pulled up.</p><p begin="00:12:00.14" data-timestamp="720.14">And standing there, watching all of this, during this intense moment we're all living through, where race and justice and survival are at the forefront of everything, Diane wondered what were all these different people thinking in this quiet little grocery store.</p><p begin="00:12:15.31" data-timestamp="735.31">So she went back the next night-- it was this past Saturday night, June 6-- with a microphone and with our co-worker, Lina Misitzis. They stayed all night, until 5:00 in the morning, talked to dozens of people. And they put this next story together.</p><p begin="00:12:29.66" data-timestamp="749.66">Usually, I just want to say, we do not point out the race of the people that we talk to on the radio, unless there's some particular reason. But race is the context for so many interactions, including the ones at the store, that in this story, we're going to identify the race or nationality of everybody who you're going to hear. OK, here's Diane.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:12:49.37" data-timestamp="769.37"> We got to Mr. Mango just before the city's 8:00 PM curfew. Inside, it was crowded and serious. People were shopping silently, trying to keep a distance, trying to move fast and get out of the store and get home by 8:00. A police helicopter buzzed overhead.</p><p begin="00:13:06.98" data-timestamp="786.98">Mr. Mango is a small grocery store with inexpensive produce out front and a mix of regular and bougie groceries inside. They have 35 kinds of honey, but also dollar pineapples. The cashiers were hurriedly checking everyone out from an island in the middle of the store.</p><p begin="00:13:26.45" data-timestamp="806.45">Once curfew kicked in, things relaxed. Like, all the anxious rule followers had cleared out. The regulars started filtering in-- neighborhood people, essential workers. A white guy in pajama pants came in to buy a corkscrew. Chan, who's Thai and manages the restaurant three doors down, he came in after his shift ended at 10:00 to pick up some pita chips for his husband. The curfew had actually been good for business.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chan</h4><p begin="00:13:51.61" data-timestamp="831.61"> When it's next to 8:00, people were so afraid that they will have to stuck at home or something, so a lot of delivery is going to happen around that time, yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:14:03.87" data-timestamp="843.87"> How many tonight?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chan</h4><p begin="00:14:05.03" data-timestamp="845.03"> Tonight, we hit, like, 3,000.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:14:08.42" data-timestamp="848.42"> $3,000, which is 50% more than usual, he told me. Devon, a black man who lives around the corner, stopped by in a camo facemask to pick up some ice and cups. He was hanging out with a friend from Jersey that night.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Devon</h4><p begin="00:14:22.52" data-timestamp="862.52"> Yeah, with all this going on, I need something to unwind a little bit. But this has been rough, this world right now-- everything that's going on. No basketball season, no sports. My daughter can't graduate high school. Couldn't have a graduation. Only great thing about this thing, my grandson is born now.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:14:43.21" data-timestamp="883.21"> Wow, congratulations.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Devon</h4><p begin="00:14:44.23" data-timestamp="884.23"> One month old. I'm sorry for people who lost death, but my daughter's happy. My grandson is home. They're safe.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:14:53.00" data-timestamp="893"> The ice he was carrying to the register, actually, was for a toast for baby Thurmond. One group of regulars was hard to get to talk, because they were either rushing to work or exhausted-- the hospital workers. Everyone else had moved on to the new crisis, but they were still very much inside the previous one.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:15:12.06" data-timestamp="912.06"> Do you have a minute to talk?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hospital Worker</h4><p begin="00:15:13.58" data-timestamp="913.58"> Mm, I just came from work. [INAUDIBLE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:15:16.32" data-timestamp="916.32"> A black woman on the hospital cleaning crew, Bernice, talked to me for one minute and 24 seconds while she shopped, and wasted none of it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bernice</h4><p begin="00:15:24.87" data-timestamp="924.87"> I'm tired.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:15:25.93" data-timestamp="925.93"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bernice</h4><p begin="00:15:26.72" data-timestamp="926.72"> Because of this coronavirus, I've been working for the last 96 days. And then you got these people out here protesting, which I'm all for that, but they're going about the wrong way with the burning buildings and stores. And people got to survive, you know. This is your neighborhood. You shouldn't be doing stuff like that. You know, you've got to do it the right way. But that's just my opinion. And I'm delirious and I'm tired right now, so I'm about to go.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:15:49.89" data-timestamp="949.89"> I know. I feel tired for you-- 96 days.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bernice</h4><p begin="00:15:53.16" data-timestamp="953.16"> I'm actually walking slowly by slowly, taking it step by step. I am, like, burnt out, drained. I don't know what to say anymore. Just go to work and just pray that the same way you leave there, you come back home that way. That's all I can say, mama. You be careful. Have a good night. I gots to go.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:16:12.12" data-timestamp="972.12"> At the cashier's island, there's Ronny, who's new at Mr. Mango. He just started working here this week. He's Latino, from Guatemala. And Dorje, the longtime overnight cashier, gracious and calm. Dorje is from Bhutan. He's the quiet center of gravity of the whole store and does not want to be on the radio. Every time I swing the microphone in his direction, he leans back and puts his hands up to protect himself from it.</p><p begin="00:16:40.11" data-timestamp="1000.11">Once the mic is safely out of sight, though, he's happy to talk. After I interview any of his regulars, Dorje helpfully fills in the details. That guy is a really hard worker. They come almost every day after a long day. They used to buy Corona, but after coronavirus, they started getting a different beer.</p><p begin="00:17:01.83" data-timestamp="1021.83">One of the regulars, Schecter, who's Asian, tells me that Mr. Mango is his favorite store in his whole life. And the reason is Dorje and the other night cashier, Karma, who's off tonight.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Schecter</h4><p begin="00:17:12.60" data-timestamp="1032.6"> Last year, I had a bad year. Everything started to fall apart. In my worst moments, I would come here at midnight or 1:00 in the morning and just be with them. And I found out that I wasn't the only one.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:17:25.77" data-timestamp="1045.77"> Ever since the pandemic, Dorje has been working more-- 72 hours a week. He's tired. Tomorrow is his day off. As it gets later, around midnight, the mood at Mr. Mango shifts. Some of the energy outside filters in. Lina tells what happens next.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:17:47.88" data-timestamp="1067.88"> Protesters keep turning up. A sunburned couple, white, holding hands on their way home from a rally. They buy ice cream, beer, and lemons. Patrick, an older black man with long hair and a beard to match, he'd been out protesting, too. Wanted to grab a snack before turning in. He bought one pineapple.</p><p begin="00:18:08.85" data-timestamp="1088.85">And then these protesters-- I call them Josh and Katie. They seemed about 30, both of them white. She had long red hair, and he had knuckle tattoos, but he refused to show them to us-- for his own protection, he said, and because he didn't want to put himself as an individual ahead of the movement.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:18:25.61" data-timestamp="1105.61"> Do you like persimmons?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:18:26.79" data-timestamp="1106.79"> Not really.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:18:27.60" data-timestamp="1107.6"> Why not? So tell me, what's up?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:18:30.87" data-timestamp="1110.87"> I just don't like them that much. I don't know why. I never really liked them that much.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:18:34.13" data-timestamp="1114.13"> You're getting started.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:18:35.00" data-timestamp="1115"> But I like them. You know I eat anything.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:18:37.26" data-timestamp="1117.26"> Josh and Katie told Diane they'd spent the day marching all over Brooklyn.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:18:41.07" data-timestamp="1121.07"> Went through Flatbush, Crown Heights, Bedstuy, and then back up here to Barclays.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:18:45.66" data-timestamp="1125.66"> You sound a little tired.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:18:47.64" data-timestamp="1127.64"> I was locked up for a long time after one of the recent violent assaults on a protest in one of the outer boroughs.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:18:56.25" data-timestamp="1136.25"> So you got arrested this week.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:18:57.87" data-timestamp="1137.87"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:18:59.52" data-timestamp="1139.52"> Josh kept talking about what he called movement moments. Katie focused on shopping for fruit.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:19:05.02" data-timestamp="1145.02"> They have the best fruit. They have plantains. They have litchis. They have soursop. They have star fruit. They have mamey. They have things you don't see in America. I mean, you know, these guys are the real deal.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:19:17.63" data-timestamp="1157.63"> Oh, oh, oh, oh.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:19:20.49" data-timestamp="1160.49"> Hang on.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:19:20.97" data-timestamp="1160.97"> What's going on?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:19:21.45" data-timestamp="1161.45"> What's going on?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:19:24.86" data-timestamp="1164.86"> Hey, what's up? How're you doing?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:19:27.18" data-timestamp="1167.18"> What just happened?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:19:29.53" data-timestamp="1169.53"> What happened was a couple NYPD walked into Mr. Mango, and Josh and Katie immediately reacted. Josh very dramatically stopped talking, wrapped a scarf around his face, so that all that were showing were his eyes. He looked like a mummy, who was also an anarchist. He crept away, picked up some tofu, and held it like a prop and glanced back at the police.

It was just Dorje and Ronny in there. They were in constant motion-- Ronny restocking the eggs and coconut water, Dorje cleaning the coffee machine and rearranging the pastries. Around 3:30, a really out of it man walked in. He was black. It seemed like he might have been homeless. He got a muffin.</p><p begin="00:36:46.46" data-timestamp="2206.46">After that, no one came in. And the store felt like a safe, clean cocoon, full of soap and honey and different kinds of sprinkles.

Today's show, Here Again, the stories in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd that we recorded this past week.</p><p begin="00:37:56.32" data-timestamp="2276.32">So there are these Twitter threads that have sprung up these last couple weeks where people were collecting as many videos of police violence against protesters as they can find. I spent a lot of time scrolling through the ones assembled by a North Carolina lawyer named T. Greg Doucette. He's also got them in handy Google Doc form online. He has over 600 videos so far, and he says people have sent him 1,600 direct messages with links that he hasn't even gotten to yet.</p><p begin="00:38:19.53" data-timestamp="2299.53">The stuff that police are doing in these videos, I mean, the tactics that they're using against peaceful protests, it is not news. There's nothing new about it. At this point, I think everybody knows or should know that this stuff is happening. But watching them back to back, all collected in one place, the sheer concentrated volume of it is unnerving. The simplest ones start with utterly peaceful demonstrators.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Protesters</h4><p begin="00:38:43.53" data-timestamp="2323.53"> This is what democracy looks like!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:38:45.99" data-timestamp="2325.99"> In San Luis Obispo, Bentonville, Arkansas, Columbus, Ohio, Huntsville, Georgia, Walnut Creek, California-- too many places to name.

There's a neighborhood in Brooklyn, Red Hook, where there was a debate about this.</p><p begin="00:41:11.71" data-timestamp="2471.71">A couple weeks ago, one woman, who is white, woke up, read the news of the day, and then posted online that she wanted to have a protest. She got several responses from local community leaders asking her not to do it.</p><p begin="00:41:23.98" data-timestamp="2483.98">The wife of a local pastor wrote, please reconsider this. There's more damage than good that will come from this. The hurt and anger that the black community has right now will not allow for this to end up peacefully. In the end, you will be able to go back home to a quiet peaceful block, but the residents of NYCHA-- that's the public housing-- won't. They will end up with more police presence, possible curfew, some may get hurt, and so much more.</p><p begin="00:41:48.23" data-timestamp="2508.23">The one who wrote the initial post backed down. But last weekend, there was a protest in Red Hook.

It's been-- it has been cordial. It has been cordial, but they say things like, so we need the route. And I say, I don't think you need the route. And they say, well, you don't have a permit. You know what I mean? Like, hey, if you don't give me the route, we're going to shut it down because you don't have a permit-- things like that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:42:52.06" data-timestamp="2572.06"> So you didn't give them the route.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Na Dortch</h4><p begin="00:42:53.08" data-timestamp="2573.08"> I didn't give them the route at all. I didn't give anyone the route.

Three weeks ago, Na was doing what a lot of us were.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Na Dortch</h4><p begin="00:43:03.58" data-timestamp="2583.58"> Literally, I was doing nothing. Literally nothing. I was just home in my house, doing nothing. Just going outside sometimes, getting some air, but I was doing nothing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:43:14.83" data-timestamp="2594.83"> And then George Floyd was killed. The country erupted in protest.

And nobody's out here protesting, and I was just like, fuck it. I'm going to do a protest.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:43:28.87" data-timestamp="2608.87"> He'd been to a few protests over the years. When he was 17, he joined a Black Lives Matter group for a few days. But he felt like he was too young to make a difference, to be heard. Everyone else in the group was ancient, in their 30s.</p><p begin="00:43:42.58" data-timestamp="2622.58">He texted his friend Crystal. She agreed to be his secretary. Made a flyer with the date and time for the protest. Na pulled in his friends, Mo Pringle-- like the chimp, she told me-- Naseem Stevenson, who plans to go to law school, and a few others. They came up with a name-- the New BLQK Leaders, black spelled BLQK, because the other version was taken.</p><p begin="00:44:12.89" data-timestamp="2652.89">Objectively, 2020 has been an unremitting shit storm of a year, but things have actually been going OK for Na. He recently came out to his friends and family. Most of them were supportive. His grandmother asked a few awkward questions and then tried to get some hot gossip about who else was gay. He's been feeling more empowered lately, more like himself.</p><p begin="00:44:34.99" data-timestamp="2674.99">But when he and some friends decided to have a protest, they got the same response from some community leaders as the other woman, the one who proposed a protest on Facebook. They worried it could be dangerous. People from outside the neighborhood could come in and start trouble. It could give the cops a reason to harass them or to get violent.</p><p begin="00:44:53.27" data-timestamp="2693.27">One of them felt like people have been protesting for years, and nothing had changed. The New BLQK Leaders had a Zoom call where they tried to convince them everything would be fine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Na Dortch</h4><p begin="00:45:03.74" data-timestamp="2703.74"> I'm going to express all throughout the protest, we do not want agitators here. If you see anyone who's trying to agitate, stop them. If you feel like you are going to get agitated or if you are here to be violent, leave. I'm going to constantly express that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:45:21.50" data-timestamp="2721.5"> After this call with the community leaders, though, one of them, a guy who serves as a community liaison to the 76th precinct, sent an email to the police, telling them what route he thought the march would take and giving them the names and photos of the organizers. It made Na feel even more targeted than he already did.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Na Dortch</h4><p begin="00:45:40.83" data-timestamp="2740.83"> It hurt me. It almost discouraged me, because it made me feel like, damn, nobody believes in us. You know what I mean? Even though we constantly express how it was going to go and we expressed that, you can help us make sure that these things remain-- like, the protest is safe. But it almost discouraged me. It kind of made me feel like, I didn't know what I was doing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:46:04.70" data-timestamp="2764.7"> Na's friends, the other organizers, convinced him to keep going. And that email, it was actually the reason one of the reticent community leaders, Tiffiney Davis, decided to go to the protest.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tiffiney Davis</h4><p begin="00:46:16.85" data-timestamp="2776.85"> It's a crazy day-- it's an empowering, but scary day.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:46:21.56" data-timestamp="2781.56"> Tiffiney runs an organization called Red Hook Art Project.

Do they look like they want to start trouble?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:47:25.68" data-timestamp="2845.68"> No, they look like they want to make T-shirts and signs.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tiffiney Davis</h4><p begin="00:47:29.01" data-timestamp="2849.01"> They just want opportunities to be seen and heard and respected.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:47:33.56" data-timestamp="2853.56"> The signs and T-shirts had George Floyd's face on them and Black Lives Matter-- and also, Forever Deion.

Some cops tried to arrest him, and he jumped into the subway tracks to get away.</p><p begin="00:47:52.69" data-timestamp="2872.69">He ended up in the hospital, paralyzed from the neck down in a coma and shackled to the bed. The police say he was hit by a train, but his family says he woke up from the coma and told them the police had beaten him and left him on the subway tracks. He died from the injuries not long after.</p><p begin="00:48:19.31" data-timestamp="2899.31">When 4:00 PM comes, there are probably 100 to 200 people waiting for the protest to begin.

So there's this video making the rounds that a bunch of us saw, and we thought the writer who is in it, Kimberly Jones, did such a good job giving context and laying out a history quickly in a way that anybody can understand. That even though this video has gotten a lot of views online and even after we learned that John Oliver ended his HBO show last week with this video, we still wanted to play it here.</p><p begin="00:58:55.21" data-timestamp="3535.21">Kimberly Jones starts this video by talking about the looters in the recent protests. And she says, people say all these negative things about the looters, but don't ask why they're looting. And to explain a feeling that lots of people have, she launches into an economic history of black people in America, starting with slavery.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kimberly Jones</h4><p begin="00:59:12.09" data-timestamp="3552.09"> We must never forget that economics was the reason that black people were brought to this country. We came to do the agricultural work in the south and the textile work in the north. Do you understand that? That's what we came to do.</p><p begin="00:59:27.04" data-timestamp="3567.04">Now if I right now decided that I wanted to play Monopoly with you and for 400 rounds of playing Monopoly, I didn't allow you to have any money, I didn't allow you to have anything on the board, I didn't allow for you to have anything. And then we played another 50 rounds of Monopoly and everything that you gained and you earned while you were playing that round of Monopoly was taken from you-- that was Tulsa. That was Rosewood.</p><p begin="00:59:53.37" data-timestamp="3593.37">Those are places where we built black economic wealth, where we were self-sufficient, where we owned our stores, where we owned our property, and they burned them to the ground. So that's 450 years. So for 400 rounds of Monopoly, you don't get to play at all. Not only do you not get to play, you have to play on the behalf of the person that you're playing against. You have to play and make money and earn wealth for them, and then you have to turn it over to them.</p><p begin="01:00:22.53" data-timestamp="3622.53">So then for 50 years, you finally get a little bit, and you're allowed to play. And every time that they don't like the way that you're playing, or that you're catching up, or that you're doing something to be self-sufficient, they burn your game. They burn your cards. They burn your Monopoly money.</p><p begin="01:00:39.39" data-timestamp="3639.39">And then, finally, at the release and the onset of that, they allow you to play and they say, OK, now you catch up. How can you win? How can you win? You can't win. The game is fixed. So when they say, why did you burn down the community, why did you burn down your own neighborhood, it's not ours. We don't own anything. We don't own anything.</p><p begin="01:01:08.56" data-timestamp="3668.56">Trevor Noah said it so beautifully last night. There's a social contract that we all have. That if you steal or if I steal, then the person who is the authority comes in and they fix the situation. But the person who fixes the situation is killing us! So the social contract is broken.</p><p begin="01:01:27.51" data-timestamp="3687.51">And if the social contract is broken, why the fuck do I give a shit about burning the fucking Football Hall of Fame, about burning a fucking Target? You broke the contract when you killed us in the streets and didn't give a fuck!</p><p begin="01:01:40.71" data-timestamp="3700.71">You broke the contract, and for 400 years, we played your game and built your wealth. You broke the contract when we built our wealth again on our own by our bootstraps in Tulsa, and you dropped bombs on us. When we built it in Rosewood, and you came in and you slaughtered us.</p><p begin="01:01:58.92" data-timestamp="3718.92">You broke the contract, so fuck your Target. Fuck your Hall of Fame. Far as I'm concerned, they could burn this bitch to the ground. And it still wouldn't be enough. And they are lucky that what black people are looking for is equality and not revenge.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="01:02:21.06" data-timestamp="3741.06"> Kimberly Jones, she's a writer, author of a young adult novel.
