    <div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:00:00.48" data-timestamp="0.48"> From WBEZ Chicago, it's This American Life. I'm Neil Drumming, sitting in for Ira Glass. Every so often, I'll be talking to another black person, usually someone with an accent. And they'll stop mid-conversation and ask me where my family's from or if I'm from the islands. And I'll say something like, "I'm not sure. I think I'm West Indian on my dad's side." I've said this 100 times without any actual proof. I don't know where I got it from, and there's no evidence that I can find. I asked my dad recently, and he wasn't sure. He said, maybe. Going back generations, someone stopped at some island between Africa and South Carolina.</p><p begin="00:00:35.67" data-timestamp="35.67">My cousin Yvonne, though, her dad was definitely born in Panama. A few years back, she invited me to come stand on the road with her and watch the big party Caribbean people throw here in New York every year, the West Indian Day parade-- technically, the West Indian American Day parade. I still remember how excited she got when a group of Panamanians came marching down Eastern Parkway.</p><p begin="00:00:55.18" data-timestamp="55.18">My cousin is tall, over six feet, and loud. And she really made a show of jumping and shouting and waving her flag. I envied her in that moment. This is uncomfortable for me to say, but I've sometimes felt a sense of vagueness just being black in America.</p><p begin="00:01:12.27" data-timestamp="72.27">That's the thing about the West Indian Day parade. There's all these black people who seem to know exactly, specifically, where they're from. And on this one day, they tell everyone. Like, this guy, for example. It's not just where he's from, but it's how he says it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:01:25.96" data-timestamp="85.96"> Where are you from?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Man 1</h4><p begin="00:01:27.49" data-timestamp="87.49"> Jamaica.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:01:28.88" data-timestamp="88.88"> You live in this neighborhood?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:01:30.40" data-timestamp="90.4"> No, I'm not living in this neighborhood. I'm living in the Bronx.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:01:32.63" data-timestamp="92.63"> OK, so you came all the way down here?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:01:34.35" data-timestamp="94.35"> Yes, mon...</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:01:34.86" data-timestamp="94.86"> He and his friend came down from the Bronx and had been partying nearby. I ran into them on Eastern Parkway early that morning. The parade hadn't even started yet, but they were already repping their country.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:01:44.54" data-timestamp="104.54"> Jamaicans control-- control the Parkway.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 2</h4><p begin="00:01:47.13" data-timestamp="107.13"> And go on like saying, Jamaican our own things. But we have the best artists, we have the best food, we have the best culture.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:01:52.66" data-timestamp="112.66"> And we have the best [INAUDIBLE], too.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 2</h4><p begin="00:01:54.52" data-timestamp="114.52"> We have to say no more.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:01:55.94" data-timestamp="115.94"> These guys, they don't even talk like this all the time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 2</h4><p begin="00:01:59.04" data-timestamp="119.04"> So later on, around 10 o'clock, the parade will actually start. That's the big, big thing. You'll see a lot more people flooding the streets.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:02:07.76" data-timestamp="127.76"> A few years ago, I moved just a few blocks from the parade route on Eastern Parkway, the broad tree-lined corridor that passes through the neighborhood of Crown Heights. The parade is actually part of a week-long celebration in Brooklyn called the Labor Day Carnival, which is itself just the New York version of Carnival, which is celebrated all over the Caribbean and the world.</p><p begin="00:02:26.24" data-timestamp="146.24">Most days, Crown Heights feels a lot like other neighborhoods I've lived in-- a corner bodega here, a liquor store there, gentrification creeping in. But one weekend every year, I wake up to reggae, and soca, and feathers, and floats, and people waving flags from all over. There's barely anywhere to stand. There's guys on stilts, and there are police everywhere. It feels like the neighborhood's been completely transformed.</p><p begin="00:02:47.55" data-timestamp="167.55">But of course, that's not what's actually happening. It's more like the neighborhood is turning inside out, letting you see what's at its core. So many of the people who make their homes in Crown Heights also carry pieces of another homeland with them-- the Bahamas, Grenada, Jamaica, Barbados, St. Lucia, Trinidad. Every year, anywhere between 1 and 2 million people show up. It's pretty thrilling just to stand on the sidelines and watch it all pass by you, you know, like a parade.</p><p begin="00:03:15.72" data-timestamp="195.72">But I wanted to live inside it more, to understand as best I can how my cousin felt that day, to know what it means to have a flag to wave. So that's what we're doing this hour. A bunch of us went out that weekend, dove in headfirst. Some of us even got pretty wet. Stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:03:34.86" data-timestamp="214.86">The typical image New Yorkers have of the West Indian Day parade is of thousands of people dancing down Eastern Parkway in elaborate costumes that are as colorful as they are skimpy-- feathered headdresses, winged backpacks, tiaras, and jeweled bikinis. I learned that this is called playing mas. The mas is short for masquerade.</p><p begin="00:03:59.86" data-timestamp="239.86">My co-producer Jessica and I went out really early on Labor Day and met up with some masqueraders who were dressed in costumes that they had chosen from a selection of different movie themes, like The Little Mermaid, Coming to America, and Showgirls. Just to say, the outfits were only marginally related to the films. It was more about color palette than anything. One woman wore a plume of black and yellow feathers, evoking Quentin Tarantino's most famous heroine.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jessica Lussenhop</h4><p begin="00:04:22.44" data-timestamp="262.44"> So explain your costume. Which costume is this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:04:25.44" data-timestamp="265.44"> So this is Kill Bill. I regret these big feathers. I don't know where I'm going with this. But this is Kill Bill and--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jessica Lussenhop</h4><p begin="00:04:31.26" data-timestamp="271.26"> Why do you regret them?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:04:33.70" data-timestamp="273.7"> Because they're-- do you-- girl, I'm going to need you put on a costume and try to walk down the Parkway with big feathers on it. It was a bad mistake. Feathers coming out of this, some stones came off.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jessica Lussenhop</h4><p begin="00:04:44.58" data-timestamp="284.58"> What's the experience of putting on an outfit like this and coming out--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:04:49.05" data-timestamp="289.05"> It's hell. It took me two hours, and a lot of people's breaking down already. We didn't even hit the Parkway. Just know if you're going to do it, just carry a lot of-- not a lot, but carry some Krazy Glue with you. And you're going to be putting yourself together once you get out here.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jessica Lussenhop</h4><p begin="00:05:01.53" data-timestamp="301.53"> What made you decide on Kill Bill?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:05:05.04" data-timestamp="305.04"> To be honest with you, I'm chubby. So Kill Bill had a monokini, and I liked it, so I went with that. And me and a two-piece, we ain't friends right now. And we ain't hit the gym. So Kill Bill it was.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:05:20.12" data-timestamp="320.12"> For many people, playing mas starts even earlier than the parade, at the parade before the parade. It's called J'ouvert, and it's a celebration with deep, deep roots in the Caribbean. J'ouvert's mythology is populated with outlandish characters, like the menacing Midnight Robber with his wide-brimmed hat, the insanely voluptuous Dame Lorraine, and the many devils.</p><p begin="00:05:42.25" data-timestamp="342.25">Writer Imani Brown grew up with J'ouvert, but she didn't actually start going until she got to Brooklyn. Her story starts over 2,000 miles away.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Imani Brown</h4><p begin="00:05:48.99" data-timestamp="348.99"> In Trinidad, Carnival is so big that you study it in school. The year I turned 10, we were given an assignment to pick one of the traditional Carnival mas characters we just learned about, create a costume, and put on a performance in front of the rest of the school.</p><p begin="00:06:07.77" data-timestamp="367.77">Picking my character was a struggle. But in the end, I settled on the jab molassie, sometimes called the Blue Devil in Trinidad. I picked it mostly because I knew the costume would be one of the easiest to make, and time was running out. I cut holes into an old pair of shorts and a thin T-shirt. I fashioned horns from paper towel rolls and looped strips of paper into a chain that I could wrap around my body. A pitchfork I fabricated from tree branches from my backyard completed the look.</p><p begin="00:06:40.05" data-timestamp="400.05">On the day of the performance, I changed into my costume in the classroom, smeared myself all over with blue paint, and then headed towards the auditorium. I was the kind of child who avoided attention, and everything in me was fighting the idea of being onstage. When I stepped out alone in front of the whole school, my heart was racing.</p><p begin="00:06:59.53" data-timestamp="419.53">My teacher told us that the jab molassie was a demon that terrorizes, a creature barely kept on its leash. So on the stage that day, I might have crouched, or jumped, or hissed, or bared my teeth at the crowd-- I'm not sure. I just remember my anxiety wasn't painful anymore. It was exhilarating. I felt wicked, and nasty, and playful, and tricky. So completely out of character and still so utterly myself. Deeply inside my body and yet somehow floating above it. When it's good, that's what it feels like to play mas.</p><p begin="00:07:41.63" data-timestamp="461.63">For a long time, mas didn't really feel like mine. I grew up in Trinidad, but my father and mother are from Jamaica and Guyana respectively. Carnival in those places simply does not compare to the space the festival takes up in Trinidad, where Carnival is king and its influence swirls year round.</p><p begin="00:08:00.63" data-timestamp="480.63">Everyone, my mother would say, laughing and shaking her head, everyone from the biggest partier to the most religious church mouse is out on the road come Monday. My family didn't go to church regularly, but there was no way my parents were going to let me participate in Carnival proper as a teenager. That was for grown people.</p><p begin="00:08:21.19" data-timestamp="501.19">When I left Trinidad for college in the States, the loneliness took me by surprise. I was 18, and homesickness was a physical and nearly constant ache. It was then that I played J'ouvert for the first time at Brooklyn's Labor Day parade. There, I finally felt at home again. And in the year since, the parade has become a spiritual practice.</p><p begin="00:08:48.87" data-timestamp="528.87">J'ouvert always begins in the dark. This year, climbing up and out of the subway at Grand Army Plaza, the sky isn't quite pitch black, but it's close. Against the glare of police floodlights, I can just make out a stream of people trickling down the road in clumps. My friends and I join the stream, moving towards the NYPD metal barriers that narrow into a checkpoint. We are patted down and our bags opened.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Officer</h4><p begin="00:09:13.87" data-timestamp="553.87"> How're you doing, ma'am? Can you just open that up and just show me all what you got in there?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Imani Brown</h4><p begin="00:09:16.94" data-timestamp="556.94"> J'ouvert is derived from the French Creole word for daybreak. And traditionally, Brooklyn starts at around 4:00 AM, ending not too long after the sun rises. But this year, the rising sun is what marks the beginning of the parade. At 6:00 AM, the parade is starting much later than usual. The reason given is that it will help curb the violence that many have come to associate with the event.</p><p begin="00:09:43.01" data-timestamp="583.01">In 2015, a young lawyer in Governor Andrew Cuomo's administration, Carey Gabay, was hit and killed by a stray bullet along the route. The next year, it was reported that four people were shot at the parade, two of whom died. Here's what's rarely mentioned in those news reports. The violence that black people experience in these long neglected neighborhoods is year round. It doesn't end when the cameras leave the parade. And in some cases, the incidents that the media have connected to the parade happen away from the parade's actual route.</p><p begin="00:10:15.13" data-timestamp="615.13">The news coverage J'ouvert typically receives is frustrating, but not surprising. No matter what part of the globe you're from, you know that this is part of what it means to be black. The things you do to secure joy for yourself in a world that would rather see you dead become the way the world then rationalizes your suffering.</p><p begin="00:10:34.31" data-timestamp="634.31">For the media, for everyone outside of our community, the story of the parade is the story of the violence. This is why it feels impossible to smile back when the officer checking our bags grins as if we're sharing an inside joke and comments, "Just need to make sure you don't have a gun," before letting us through.</p><p begin="00:10:57.15" data-timestamp="657.15">Once we're past the checkpoint, the crowd thickens. It's clear that for some people, the morning is just beginning, and that for others, a long night of partying is simply stretching itself a little bit longer. Everyone is drifting, tripping down the street in no real hurry.</p><p begin="00:11:13.92" data-timestamp="673.92">No one is wearing anything they wouldn't mind sacrificing to the J'ouvert gods-- old tanks and short shorts, ratty T-shirts, and strappy dresses that ride up the thigh. Flags are everywhere, tied around waists, worn as capes. The red, green, and gold of Grenada's flag in particular can be seen near and far.</p><p begin="00:11:35.26" data-timestamp="695.26">The closer we get to the front of the route, the more clearly we can hear the sound of whistles and conchs up the road. The tinny sound of somebody beating out a rhythm on a small metal pan is joined briefly by the heavy beat of a cowbell. Both are swallowed up by the sound of the steel pan band warming up.</p><p begin="00:11:57.85" data-timestamp="717.85">And the devils are out. The Grenadian jab jabs are covered from head to toe in slick, black oil. The whites of their eyes and teeth seem to jump out of their skin. Locks and wigs and braids are wrapped up tightly in plastic bags. Sacrificing old clothes is one thing, but getting oil and powder out of a new sew-in is quite another.</p><p begin="00:12:20.16" data-timestamp="740.16">The devils wear hardhats and helmets crowned with black horns. I narrowly avoid getting hit by one of the many shopping carts many of the devils are pushing down the road, most of them full of plastic bags and buckets-- and in some cases, other passed-out devils.</p><p begin="00:12:37.22" data-timestamp="757.22">The smell of grease and smoke rose heavier. Two young devils spot my friends and me and loudly proclaim that we're too clean. One of the devils dips his hands into a bucket of oil, and the other beckons us closer. He smiles wide, and it's both a dare and a promise, an invitation and a threat. We shake our heads, but we're all laughing as he walks up to us and starts rubbing us down with the oil anyway. You don't come to J'ouvert if you're not prepared to get dirty.</p><p begin="00:13:12.68" data-timestamp="792.68">The U-Haul vans pulling along the rhythm section and steel pan bands, who are now in full swing, start inching down the road. A woman climbs on top of the bumper of a van, winding her way slowly in a smooth, rippling motion that extends from her shoulders down to her legs. A man hoists himself up behind her, and she picks up the pace.</p><p begin="00:13:35.11" data-timestamp="815.11">We flag down a young woman selling Nutcrackers, sweet drinks mixed heavily with rum and vodka, despite reports of a crackdown on the sale of these drinks. She asks if she can take a picture of us that she then posts on her Instagram to promote her business. We all giggle like we've known each other for years as we pose.</p><p begin="00:13:58.48" data-timestamp="838.48">Trying to mark the moment the parade slides from darkness into daylight is like trying to track the ripening of a mango. It happens slowly and then all at once. Suddenly, I'm squinting into the sun, and everything that felt clear in the night looks and feels strange to me now. This is a part of it, too. Within this space, what is real and what is a hallucination?</p><p begin="00:14:21.51" data-timestamp="861.51">Moko jumbies, sure-footed performers on six-foot stilts, drift by like clouds without looking down. Three devils covered in white paint are on the roof of a nearby building, winding and waving a huge Trinidad flag over the crowd, as if claiming territory. How did they get up there? I have no idea. But somehow, in the moment, there's nothing that doesn't make sense.</p><p begin="00:14:51.18" data-timestamp="891.18">J'ouvert began as a way to celebrate surviving the most brutal aspects of slavery. In J'ouvert, you can see out of the eyes of the demons that once drove you with the whip. You can embody the worst thing that ever hurt you and come out the other side invincible. When our people were enslaved, they were driven into burning cane fields to harvest the land. Those that survived came out covered in soot and ash. The horror defies imagination.</p><p begin="00:15:22.06" data-timestamp="922.06">But at every turn, we have been taught that we are weak, that we are cowards, that we are less than human. So we play J'ouvert to remember that no one has the power to make monsters of us but ourselves. We play J'ouvert, and in that time, we become more fearsome than anything that could ever terrorize us. In a world that asks us to be quieter, to do less, to accept the worst of everything and to pretend to like it, J'ouvert becomes the altar where we can finally fall to our knees and worship ourselves.</p><p begin="00:16:00.17" data-timestamp="960.17">I am two Nutcrackers in when the brass of the rhythm section really gets going. Something deep and sweet fills me. This year has been harder than most. I haven't had the money for a plane ticket, and it's been over a year since I was in my backyard, pressing my feet into the grass, watching the sunset, feeling the wetness of the air hug my body. There is a person I am when I am home, and I miss her desperately.</p><p begin="00:16:28.37" data-timestamp="988.37">Now, a current runs through my chest, my belly, my legs. I am not home, but I am home. I'm home. I swing my hips and roll my waist and slow dance, and for a moment, feel the way I did when I was 10, jumping back and forth between fear and exhilaration, getting low to the ground, feeling something like awe and pride start to crack my chest open.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>       Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:16:54.54" data-timestamp="1014.54"> Imani Brown is a Jamaican writer and poet whose work focuses on race, gender, and Caribbean folklore.

  <h3>Act Two</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:17:12.00" data-timestamp="1032">Pretty much all summer, if you're walking around certain parts of Brooklyn, you can hear the sound of steel drums late into the night. But you never really see them. I always wonder, where are the steel drums coming from? Because when the parade comes along, it's all flatbed trucks loaded with DJ equipment and booming speakers.</p><p begin="00:17:31.27" data-timestamp="1051.27">What was all that steel drumming I heard? As it turns out, part of Labor Day Carnival is a whole steel drum competition. It's called Panorama. Those mysterious tropical sounds in the night, those are steel jam orchestras practicing, sometimes 100 people all playing together.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Angie</h4><p begin="00:17:46.30" data-timestamp="1066.3"> You know, when I say to people, "I practice every night," like, they'll say, well, can you do this?

I'm like, yeah, I say I practice every night every time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jona</h4><p begin="00:17:54.84" data-timestamp="1074.84"> Even members of our family.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Angie</h4><p begin="00:17:55.91" data-timestamp="1075.91"> Even members of our family are like, you're going to practice? Yes, we're going to practice. It's what we do.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:18:00.84" data-timestamp="1080.84"> That's Angie and her daughter Jona. This is the thing they do together every year, all summer long. And they were really hoping their band would win this year. The competition was basically going to be the last thing they did together as mom and teenage daughter. As soon as it was over, literally hours after it was over, Jona would get on a flight and leave home for her first year in college.</p><p begin="00:18:24.20" data-timestamp="1104.2">I don't know anything about steel drums, or pans, as they're called. But we found a reporter, Marlon Bishop, who is also a musician and who loves this instrument. He followed Angie and Jona as they prepared, and one of our producers, Nadia Reiman, went with them to the competition.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Marlon Bishop</h4><p begin="00:18:37.16" data-timestamp="1117.16"> The band Angie and Jona play in is called Radoes. The name comes from this famous band in Trinidad called Desperadoes. The US branch of it was called Despers, but then there was a rebellion in the ranks and the band split. It was like a divorce. The rebels were like, you want to be Despers? Fine, we'll be Radoes. That was years ago, though, and it's all good now. Well, kind of. They're rivals-- friendly rivals.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Angie</h4><p begin="00:19:03.82" data-timestamp="1143.82"> We don't want them to win.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jona</h4><p begin="00:19:05.84" data-timestamp="1145.84"> Not necessarily we don't want them to win, but we want to win on our own.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Angie</h4><p begin="00:19:09.70" data-timestamp="1149.7"> No, no, no.

Today's show, We Come From Small Places, stories from the West Indian American Day parade and the Labor Day Carnival in Brooklyn, New York City.</p><p begin="00:35:28.57" data-timestamp="2128.57">The neighborhood that the parade goes through includes another group of people that are unapologetically themselves. That's the Hasidic Jews. On this day, you'll see many of them dressed up in a costume that's particular to their culture. But unlike the mas players, they wear their uncolorful costumes year round-- the long black coats and black hats and beards, outfits that date back to 19th century Poland.</p><p begin="00:35:51.10" data-timestamp="2151.1">During the parade, they all seem to be rushing down the street, like people on their way to an important appointment, not looking at the festivities at all. My co-worker, Ira Glass, the regular host of this program, was at the parade with us and tried to talk to some Hasids about this huge yearly event that takes place in their neighborhood.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:36:07.91" data-timestamp="2167.91"> Walking up to Hasids on the street felt like walking up to people from another planet, people who had a general air of hostility-- or at least, suspicion-- towards outsiders like me. They waved me off. The best I got was from a young man who took pity on me and gamely mustered this non-committal quote about the parade.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:36:25.86" data-timestamp="2185.86"> Every person has a right to do what they want, what they feel is right.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira  Glass</h4><p begin="00:36:29.87" data-timestamp="2189.87"> But I finally found one Hasid who would actually talk to me by marching myself over to 770 Eastern Parkway, the worldwide headquarters of the Chabad movement. Chabad is the biggest Hasid organization.</p><p begin="00:36:41.58" data-timestamp="2201.58">And 770 is such an important spiritual site for them that a replica of the building at 770 Eastern Parkway was built in Jerusalem, nearly a brick-by-brick copy, with other replicas in cities around the world, which include the number 770 on the building. The number has mystical significance, meaning, among other things, depending on who you ask, Beis Moshiach, House of the Messiah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yehuda Menasha Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:37:05.11" data-timestamp="2225.11"> The 770 is not just a three digit number on the door and the address at 770 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, New York.

And he's talking about the last great leader of the Chabad movement, who died in 1994, has no successor, Menachem Mendel Schneerson. Some, like Yehuda, believe Schneerson was the messiah.</p><p begin="00:37:43.72" data-timestamp="2263.72">Yehuda spoke with me because he's taken it upon himself to be a schliach, which is a kind of emissary or missionary spreading the word about God's laws. And what that meant was that when I strode up to 770, he seemed just as glad for somebody to talk to as I was. Like, he walked up to me. Like, God had sent us both out to talk to strangers on this day at the parade, and now, here we were.</p><p begin="00:38:06.81" data-timestamp="2286.81">He admitted he'd put up a handmade sign across the parade route about the seven laws of Noah. And he was kind of hoping that the sign would do a lot of the proselytizing for him today, and he wouldn't have to engage too much with the crowd.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yehuda Menasha Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:38:18.58" data-timestamp="2298.58"> Due to the weakness of the eyes, I try to put signs over there to do my work for me.

There's a lot of colors in it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:46:54.70" data-timestamp="2814.7"> When Hai first opened his shop, his main customers were figure skaters, ballroom dancers, and drag queens. He'd never heard of Carnival. Then about 12 years ago, a Trinidadian man walked into his shop and asked for 400 identical sequined appliques. It turns out the guy was buying them for Carnival for one of the big costume groups you see march in the parade. They're called mas bands, or mas camps. Again, the mas is for masquerade.</p><p begin="00:47:21.09" data-timestamp="2841.09">Now Hai is the go-to guy for Carnival feathers for so many bands, not just here, but all over the Caribbean. Everyone knows Hai, one Trinidadian told us. While Jessica was in Hai's shop, the leader of one of the biggest mas camps in Brooklyn stopped by. Her name is Reishelle Maynard-Richards. She runs a camp called Ramajay.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hai</h4><p begin="00:47:38.43" data-timestamp="2858.43"> And half will be leg pieces, arm pieces.

Wow, you guys are so lucky.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reishelle Maynard-richards</h4><p begin="00:47:45.67" data-timestamp="2865.67"> Hi.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jessica Lussenhop</h4><p begin="00:47:46.75" data-timestamp="2866.75"> Hello.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reishelle Maynard-richards</h4><p begin="00:47:47.91" data-timestamp="2867.91"> How are you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hai</h4><p begin="00:47:49.07" data-timestamp="2869.07"> That's the Ramajay bandleader.

Like, sherbet or what would you call that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hai</h4><p begin="00:48:02.59" data-timestamp="2882.59"> Coral.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reishelle Maynard-richards</h4><p begin="00:48:03.28" data-timestamp="2883.28"> Coral.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Hai</h4><p begin="00:48:04.72" data-timestamp="2884.72"> Coral or shrimp color.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reishelle Maynard-richards</h4><p begin="00:48:06.42" data-timestamp="2886.42"> I came to get the feathers for today. Are you getting the feathers for that one today?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hai</h4><p begin="00:48:09.85" data-timestamp="2889.85"> All these are your feathers, no?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reishelle Maynard-richards</h4><p begin="00:48:10.87" data-timestamp="2890.87"> Yes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hai</h4><p begin="00:48:11.76" data-timestamp="2891.76"> All these are your feathers.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:48:13.83" data-timestamp="2893.83"> Reishelle went off to pick out more ostrich plumes, which are some of the most expensive feathers in the shop. It turns out that all these feathers are real. Hai gets his ostrich plumes from farms in South Africa. The turkey feathers, mostly from Missouri. And there are also these really long, striped pheasant tail feathers. Those are from farms in Vietnam and Cambodia. Each individual feather or piece costs $25.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hai</h4><p begin="00:48:37.49" data-timestamp="2917.49"> And sometimes you'll see individual masqueraders having over 200 pieces on their backpack, and just imagine how much money he spent on that one backpack.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jessica Lussenhop</h4><p begin="00:48:48.23" data-timestamp="2928.23"> Wow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hai</h4><p begin="00:48:49.89" data-timestamp="2929.89"> Yeah, but those are very Carnival and this is what they love. And so they save up for that one costume, right?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:48:56.34" data-timestamp="2936.34"> When the actual finished product walks down the Parkway, you're looking at almost a year's worth of work by everyone from peacock farmers in Cambodia to the designers in Trinidad and the seamstresses in southern China to Reishelle and her family in Canarsie, where her father actually hand glues feathers onto wire and bends them into headdresses and wings.</p><p begin="00:49:16.95" data-timestamp="2956.95">One other important thing that you should know about Hai's feathers is that people tell us that, because they're real, they're waterproof. Which is fortunate, because this year, it started pouring down rain early Labor Day morning. And Jessica and I found maybe 100 masqueraders hiding out in a nearby Walgreens. In the cosmetics aisle, I saw a woman posing for a picture like some odd winged supermodel underneath the fluorescent lights.</p><p begin="00:49:39.96" data-timestamp="2979.96">There was a long line to the bathroom, women in sequined bikinis crowding in two at a time. Even though everyone's feathers were soaked through and drooping, they were trying to stay in good spirits.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 1</h4><p begin="00:49:49.15" data-timestamp="2989.15"> It ain't going to stop. And we're drying our feathers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 2</h4><p begin="00:49:52.31" data-timestamp="2992.31"> I took my feathers off to dry.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jessica Lussenhop</h4><p begin="00:49:55.41" data-timestamp="2995.41"> It's wet. They are hanging up behind me in a bunch of school supplies. Yeah, I don't know. I guess, I'm curious, like, does the fact that it's raining, like--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 3</h4><p begin="00:50:02.28" data-timestamp="3002.28"> No, it don't stop us.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 4</h4><p begin="00:50:03.34" data-timestamp="3003.34"> No, it don't stop us.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 5</h4><p begin="00:50:05.18" data-timestamp="3005.18"> It don't stop us. We could party in the rain.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 6</h4><p begin="00:50:07.76" data-timestamp="3007.76"> It don't stop us, and the party don't stop.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 7</h4><p begin="00:50:09.98" data-timestamp="3009.98"> I'm still running the Parkway.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 8</h4><p begin="00:50:12.92" data-timestamp="3012.92"> It's our culture. We're here to pick up our culture, you know what I mean? Like, rain or shine, tornado.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:50:17.84" data-timestamp="3017.84"> Eventually the rain stopped. People put on their damp costumes and rejoined the parade. Mas players pay hundreds of dollars to join mas bands. For their money, the masqueraders get a costume, food and drink, and a chance to dance behind a truck with an obscenely loud sound system.</p><p begin="00:50:39.76" data-timestamp="3039.76">The folks at Ramajay, they say the number of masqueraders has been dropping over the years. This is Darryl Cox. He designs costumes for Ramajay. He was wearing a jewel-encrusted ski mask at the time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Darryl Cox</h4><p begin="00:50:49.69" data-timestamp="3049.69"> So there's a whole bunch of factors that play into part. But overall, I think it's just people may want to do different things with their income. They may not necessarily want to be half naked on the road for a couple hours, so.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:51:00.41" data-timestamp="3060.41"> What Darryl means is they'd prefer to be half naked on the road for considerably more than a few hours. He says the mas play business is suffering because people feel like the city is getting more and more strict every year about when the parade is supposed to end. Everyone's supposed to be off the road by 6:00, so masqueraders are less inclined to pay a band like Ramajay for the experience.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reishelle Maynard-richards</h4><p begin="00:51:19.30" data-timestamp="3079.3"> And one of our biggest battles is why should I spend $600 for a costume in New York when I can spend that on a flight and go to St. Lucia, or go to Jamaica, or go somewhere else and play mas there?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:51:30.11" data-timestamp="3090.11"> That's Reishelle, the woman we met in the feather shop on 37. She founded Ramajay about a decade ago and turned it into the family business. Her father played mas in Trinidad, and to this day, still spends months helping her make the band's lavish costumes by hand. For Reishelle, these days, not enough people are willing to commit to the masquerade, to the tradition of playing mas.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reishelle Maynard-richards</h4><p begin="00:51:52.21" data-timestamp="3112.21"> When you walk, what you see now, you don't see much costumes anymore. You see a lot of T-shirts and just flags. A lot of people don't get to witness the beauty of the costumes anymore, because they just see flags, and rags, and short pants, and they don't see the beauty of a lot of the costumes anymore.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:52:09.98" data-timestamp="3129.98"> Within Caribbean culture, not everyone is steeped in the same traditions Reishelle was taught. They celebrate however they can. Though there's one way of cutting loose that seems to be happening more and more, and it drives Reishelle and her staff crazy. When Ramajay rolls down the Parkway, speakers blasting, some bystanders hop the metal barriers and flood the band's ranks, dancing and waving their flags. People call this storming. Some mas players welcome it, like the more, the merrier.</p><p begin="00:52:36.34" data-timestamp="3156.34">But it doesn't look great. The traditional mas players in their feathers and jewels, jostled and crowded by stormers in shorts and T-shirts and everyday street clothes, it's just messy. And it can also be dangerous. People get harassed, even assaulted. Fights can break out. The DJs kept trying to separate the non-paying civilians from the costumed players.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>DJ</h4><p begin="00:52:55.25" data-timestamp="3175.25"> But make way for the masqueraders, please. We ask that all the people who are not playing mas to step to the right side, far, far right side of the truck, please, and make space for the masqueraders. And ladies and the men, stop winding with the outsiders and encouraging these things now. Stop winding on the outsiders, OK?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:53:14.21" data-timestamp="3194.21"> They made this announcement over and over, without much impact. And the band security got pretty fed up trying to enforce it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Security</h4><p begin="00:53:22.86" data-timestamp="3202.86"> I need the costumes to come through. Anybody that have on costumes, come through. Costumes, come through. Anybody without costumes, you're not coming in. I don't give a [BLEEP] what y'all say. Y'all mother [BLEEP] ain't coming in.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:53:36.39" data-timestamp="3216.39"> Reishelle has had enough. She recently decided that this would be Ramajay's last year in playing mas in New York City. And the stormers are why she's calling it quits. Ramajay will continue to play mas, but Reishelle would rather fly her staff to Miami, where she feels more people embrace Carnival as she knows it. It's big news. Again, here's Darryl, Ramajay's designer.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Darryl Cox</h4><p begin="00:53:57.32" data-timestamp="3237.32"> There's a lot of sadness. I haven't really even been dancing because it's almost like I miss this, but I don't miss it. Everyone seems to be happy. And I think it's finally going to hit them when we cross that stage one last time. That's not going to happen again.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:54:14.53" data-timestamp="3254.53"> It's easy to think of a parade as something unchanging, something that passes through the same place at the same time every year. The Carnival is this living thing that goes anywhere it's welcome, picking up pieces here and there, and dropping them off along the way.</p><p begin="00:54:36.92" data-timestamp="3276.92">Just as Ramajay is reaching the end of the parade route, the sky cracks open again, drenching the procession in steady sheets of rain. Plenty of people flee through the barriers for the safety of open subway entrances or storefront awnings. But a lot of people stay. And then something kind of magical happens. Ramajay's DJs crank up the music. They lead the mas bands and chants of wetted up, and the people want water, almost as if they were taunting the clouds, daring the rain to fall.</p><p begin="00:55:07.83" data-timestamp="3307.83">The masqueraders, already soggy from earlier, collectively decide, what the hell, and start to jump up in unison, harder and more exuberantly than they have all day. As they cross the finish line, the band is as presentable as it can be under the circumstances. And it's just like Darryl predicted. There's lots of people crying-- Reishelle, her family, her security, and the people who have been playing mas with Ramajay for years.</p><p begin="00:55:40.98" data-timestamp="3340.98">They pass by a panel of judges who are supposed to be scoring them on presentation. But honestly, the judging seems like it's beside the point right now. Everyone just seems happy to have spent all this time together, and they just want to keep winding and rocking.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>DJ</h4><p begin="00:55:55.46" data-timestamp="3355.46"> How many people need two more hours on the road? Put your hands up in the sky right now.</p></div>  </div>
