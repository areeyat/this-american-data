    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.43" data-timestamp="0.43"> It's a typical camp, all the normal activities-- canoeing, archery, sports. There are two girls who everybody calls the homesick girls, who will cheerfully identify themselves that way to anybody they meet.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl 1</h4><p begin="00:00:12.31" data-timestamp="12.31"> She wants to go home.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Homesick Girl 1</h4><p begin="00:00:13.42" data-timestamp="13.42"> I do. I swear to God, I want to go home.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl 2</h4><p begin="00:00:15.39" data-timestamp="15.39"> The food is like the best.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Homesick Girl 2</h4><p begin="00:00:15.85" data-timestamp="15.85"> I want to go home too.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl 3</h4><p begin="00:00:17.02" data-timestamp="17.02"> Including me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:18.19" data-timestamp="18.19"> Because it's a pretty upscale camp, there's also horseback riding. And on the rifle range, suburban girls from Chicago's North Shore lay on their bellies in sniper position while a real former Israeli soldier barks orders about how to shoot.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Instructor</h4><p begin="00:00:30.97" data-timestamp="30.97"> I know it's really hard for you ladies to keep it quiet, but try, OK? Aim and fire.</p><p begin="00:00:39.53" data-timestamp="39.53">[GUNSHOTS]</p><p begin="00:00:40.99" data-timestamp="40.99"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:41.48" data-timestamp="41.48"> The boys' cabins are all named after Indian tribes, the girls' cabins are all named after women's colleges. So perky little suburban kids are constantly informing you, I'm an Apache, I'm Mohawk, I'm in Vassar, I'm in Bryn Mawr. And it seems pretty simple, but everybody here will tell you, no one back home understands it. None of their friends, nobody. There is just a gap between camp people and non-camp people.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl 1</h4><p begin="00:01:06.77" data-timestamp="66.77"> I know. All the time during school, I'm like, I want to go to camp. I want to do this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl 2</h4><p begin="00:01:10.40" data-timestamp="70.4"> Camp is all I talk about during the year.</p><p begin="00:01:12.44" data-timestamp="72.44"></p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:01:12.55" data-timestamp="72.55"> Really?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl 2</h4><p begin="00:01:12.86" data-timestamp="72.86"> Yeah. My friends get so mad at me. They're like, we don't want to hear about camp anymore.</p><p begin="00:01:17.36" data-timestamp="77.36"></p><p begin="00:01:20.58" data-timestamp="80.58"></p><p begin="00:01:21.07" data-timestamp="81.07">Because everything that goes on at home, you can always think of something that relates something that happened at camp. And so then you tell that, and they'll be like, camp? We've heard about camp way too much.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl 1</h4><p begin="00:01:32.87" data-timestamp="92.87"> It's also little stories you tell, and you think they're so funny and everybody in your cabin understands them. And then you go home and you're laughing, and they give you a look like, what are you talking about? Like, that's stupid.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:48.35" data-timestamp="108.35"> Well, today on our program, we try to bridge the gap between camp people and non-camp people who try to understand what is the cult-like, mystical connection some people feel with their summer camps? From WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio International, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass.</p><p begin="00:02:02.72" data-timestamp="122.72">Today on our program, Notes On Camp. Six different notes, some recorded at a summer camp, and some amazing stories that actually came from you, people who listen to this program and called us up to talk camp. Stay with us.</p><p begin="00:02:14.90" data-timestamp="134.9"></p><p begin="00:02:18.22" data-timestamp="138.22"></p><p begin="00:02:20.59" data-timestamp="140.59">Most of today's program takes place in Michigan, not far from Paw Paw. Two affiliated camps, Greenwoods and Lake of the Woods, one is a boys camp, one's a girls camp. But they sit on the same land. They share everything. Basically they function as one camp. Producer Julie Snyder and I spent a fair amount of time there.</p><p begin="00:02:36.12" data-timestamp="156.12">Julie usually hung out with the girls, I usually stayed with the boys. Here then, our findings.</p></div>  </div>

Mr. Popular.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Himmel</h4><p begin="00:02:46.89" data-timestamp="166.89"> Let's try the chorus again, because something in that last part is weird.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:50.40" data-timestamp="170.4"> Counselors David Himmel and Dean Hines practice a song for Saturday night's camp show.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Himmel</h4><p begin="00:02:54.85" data-timestamp="174.85"> All right. Ready?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dean Hines</h4><p begin="00:02:55.38" data-timestamp="175.38"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Himmel</h4><p begin="00:02:55.68" data-timestamp="175.68"> OK. (SINGING) And even Hitler had a girlfriend who he could always call. She'd always be there for him, in spite of all his faults. He was the worst guy ever, vile and despised. Even Hitler had a girlfriend, so why can't-- (SPEAKING) It goes to high there. That's the problem, It's going too high.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dean Hines</h4><p begin="00:03:23.23" data-timestamp="203.23"> You think so?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Himmel</h4><p begin="00:03:24.02" data-timestamp="204.02"> (SINGING) Even Hitler had a girlfriend, so I can't--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:26.71" data-timestamp="206.71"> David Himmel has been coming to this camp since he was 11. Now, he's a counselor and a sailing instructor, a college sophomore, a boy with clear, blue eyes who actually has no trouble getting a girlfriend. Like a lot of campers and counselors we met at this camp, he says that all the best moments of his life have either been at camp or with camp people.</p><p begin="00:03:43.72" data-timestamp="223.72"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Himmel</h4><p begin="00:03:44.02" data-timestamp="224.02"> Camp. it's number one with everything I do, I guess. Camp is just-- it's kind of ridiculous, but it's everything. It changes people's lives. People base their life around camp. I would not be who I am if it wasn't for camp.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:58.90" data-timestamp="238.9"> Who would you be?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Himmel</h4><p begin="00:04:01.69" data-timestamp="241.69"> I don't know. I think I enjoy things better now because of camp. When you live so close to people like this-- and it's sort of like college-- but everybody at camp is just real close knit. It's like a bond that just happens. And that's why a day at camp is like two weeks in real life. It's like a time warp here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:24.67" data-timestamp="264.67"> And people at summer camp treat David with a deference that few of us get in real life. He and I are walking around camp one day when a group of 13-year-old girls comes up to us.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl 1</h4><p begin="00:04:32.84" data-timestamp="272.84"> He is the best counselor.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Himmel</h4><p begin="00:04:35.11" data-timestamp="275.11"> This is my fan club.

Everyone, get out of your cabins, please, immediately, and head over to get some delicious food. That would mean stop playing ping pong right now. Let's go. Go to lunch. Almuerzo. La comida.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:43.75" data-timestamp="343.75"> I sit next to Dave at lunch one day. In the mess hall, everybody at camp eats together, and it is constant singing. The girls have their own traditional songs, the boys have theirs. Most of the cabins have songs of their own. After the oldest girls' cabin sings their cheer, which, by tradition, is chanted so quickly that none of the boys and none of the younger girls can figure out what the words are, the oldest boys' cabin, the Mohawks, stands to respond.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mohawks</h4><p begin="00:06:04.62" data-timestamp="364.62"> (CHANTING) Mohawk once, Mohawk twice.

It goes, Mohawk once, Mohawk twice. Holy jumping, golly gee, Cheez Whiz, we're the best that ever lived. And it's a clean version. There's a dirty version with swear words in it. And we started singing it at lunch. We kept on getting in trouble, I said, well, we got to make a clean one.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:40.20" data-timestamp="400.2"> Radio edit.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Himmel</h4><p begin="00:06:40.74" data-timestamp="400.74"> And it just popped into my head, and it's kind of cool hearing that.

And this is kind of dumb, but I get a kick out of it. We go, (SINGING) Happy birthday to you-- and last year, I went, whoo! And now everybody does it. And it's just kind of cool. You make stuff up, and--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:04.41" data-timestamp="424.41"> It survives.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:07:05.94" data-timestamp="425.94"> David's a force. David is the one who people turn to. David is the man, at least when it comes to some things. The night of the last camp dance, David wanders the grounds, keeping his eye out for the 13-year-old boys in his cabin. He spots two of them sitting with two girls, and he says to me--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Himmel</h4><p begin="00:07:21.33" data-timestamp="441.33"> You got four 13-year-olds just chilling in a circle.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:24.72" data-timestamp="444.72"> Sitting on the ground.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Himmel</h4><p begin="00:07:25.35" data-timestamp="445.35"> Sitting on the ground, Indian style. It's like a powwow. And Dan is with Amanda, and he's going to try and kiss her tonight.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:32.91" data-timestamp="452.91"> Has he ever kissed a girl?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Himmel</h4><p begin="00:07:33.99" data-timestamp="453.99"> That's what I asked him.

He's like, no, I got it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:44.22" data-timestamp="464.22"> Which one is Amanda?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Himmel</h4><p begin="00:07:45.48" data-timestamp="465.48"> Amanda's the one with the hair braid.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:49.20" data-timestamp="469.2"> The beads in her hair?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Himmel</h4><p begin="00:07:49.86" data-timestamp="469.86"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:51.22" data-timestamp="471.22"> Now, Dan is just sitting there, kind of quiet. But he's not really saying very much.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Himmel</h4><p begin="00:07:54.09" data-timestamp="474.09"> He's a quiet kid. I mean, he doesn't really say anything unless he has something to say. Hey, buddy. He's a cool kid. He's a really--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:03.96" data-timestamp="483.96"> How do you think he's doing?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Himmel</h4><p begin="00:08:05.04" data-timestamp="485.04"> In the cabin, or in general?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:06.78" data-timestamp="486.78"> No, how do you think he's doing over there, right now, at this moment?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Himmel</h4><p begin="00:08:09.09" data-timestamp="489.09"> Oh, with Amanda? I think he's doing good. She's really into him. In that hair thing, she's got three beads that says, A heart D. Amanda loves Dan. And I talked to her, and I'm like, so how's Dan? (IMITATING AMANDA) Oh, he's fine. You like him? (IMITATING AMANDA) Yeah. So I think he's doing good.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:27.42" data-timestamp="507.42"> One of the things he most likes about camp, David tells me, is the constant, ongoing drama. It is a soap opera. And David is one of the people who's always making up skits and songs based on the hundred inside jokes that are at the heart of any camp humor. Later that night, after the dance, all of David's 13-year-olds are back in the Cheyenne cabin, getting ready for bed. And David gets a report from each one.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Himmel</h4><p begin="00:08:49.80" data-timestamp="529.8"> Keith.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Keith</h4><p begin="00:08:50.80" data-timestamp="530.8"> What?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Himmel</h4><p begin="00:08:51.78" data-timestamp="531.78"> What are you smiling about?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Keith</h4><p begin="00:08:53.76" data-timestamp="533.76"> Nothing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Himmel</h4><p begin="00:08:55.83" data-timestamp="535.83"> And Dan?

  <h3>Act Three: You</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:49.22" data-timestamp="1069.22"> Notes on Camp three, You. Well, a few weeks ago, we invited your stories about camp. And you responded, so many of you, with so many great camp stories. Here is a selection.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 1</h4><p begin="00:17:59.33" data-timestamp="1079.33"> When I was five, my parents got divorced, and my father remarried the day after. In fact, he eloped to South Dakota because, in Minnesota, you had to wait six months between your divorce and remarriage. And then when I was eight, my mom died, and we were adopted by a nice, young couple, my sister and brother and I.</p><p begin="00:18:18.80" data-timestamp="1098.8">And I remember one year, we went to a long weekend type of religious camp. It was sponsored through our church, but it had counselors there from a lot of different churches. And there was this one guy there that looked just like my dad. And I must have been, I don't know, nine and a half, 10. I was convinced that that was my father and that he had realized the error of his ways. And I had imagined that there must be some prohibition on him contacting the kids after he put them up for adoption, and I just thought this was his way of checking on us.</p><p begin="00:18:52.64" data-timestamp="1132.64">And I would say things, like leading statements like, do you remember when I was little and you fixed my dolly, Peaches? Well, of course, he just looked at me like I was nuts. I mean, he must have thought, what an odd little girl. But I was sure. And I told my sister, Tracy, isn't that Dad? And she said, no, of course not. But I was sure. Somehow, it made me feel better, as strange as that seems. For that long weekend, that was my dad.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 2</h4><p begin="00:19:17.42" data-timestamp="1157.42"> My mother emigrated to the United States from Germany in the '50s, and her understanding of American culture and traditions wasn't always quite clear. And one of her confusions was about summer camp. She knew that kids should go to summer camp, but she didn't realize that it usually involved 24-hour adult supervision. So one week, she drove us up to a campground on the coast of Malibu and set us up in this tent and left us some groceries, and then she drove home to go back to work.</p><p begin="00:19:51.69" data-timestamp="1191.69">And so I was left in charge of my brothers, and I was 12 and my brothers were 10 and 7. And we were at summer camp. We played in the ocean. We played in the little stream that ran by our campsite. We picked things and tried to figure out whether they were edible. And the only problem that we had, really, was that we had to keep it a secret that our parents weren't there, and this involved lots of stealth and subterfuge. We would notice that campers were looking over in our direction at some point and kind of wondering where our parents were.</p><p begin="00:20:32.81" data-timestamp="1232.81">So in the morning, when we got ready to go to the beach, I would unzip the tent and yell into the tent, bye, Mom, bye, Dad. We're going to the beach, see you later and hope that we'd be overheard doing this. And my brothers kind of picked up on this, so one of them, when he would see a man in a car driving out of the campground, if he was alone, he would yell after him, bye, Dad. Don't forget the Popsicles, as if the guy in the car were going to get us some groceries. We were pretty obsessed with groceries.</p><p begin="00:21:05.26" data-timestamp="1265.26">And a week later, my mom came back. We had called her and told her how much we hated summer camp. And she thought that we were extremely spoiled because we didn't appreciate this great outdoor experience that was obviously a big part of American life.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adina</h4><p begin="00:21:19.86" data-timestamp="1279.86"> The first year I went, I was 10 years old. And that was a kind of a fluke because my parents were very committed left-wingers, and they wouldn't let me join the Girl Scouts because my mother called them a bunch of little brown shirts. And they wouldn't let me go to a fashionable summer camp because they didn't believe in fashion. So my father asked a friend where his kids went, and his kids went to this very left-wing, Zionist camp. And so they got me in.</p><p begin="00:21:51.84" data-timestamp="1311.84">But we had, one day at lunchtime, a rock came through the window of the dining hall. And it landed in my soup, and there was a note wrapped around the rock. And it said, we don't want no Jew camps in Wisconsin. And so, of course, being a highly political group of people, they got together, and they had discussions, and they went on and on. And they posted guards. We had to paint our faces black so we wouldn't show up at night, and so on.</p><p begin="00:22:23.47" data-timestamp="1343.47">And so a bunch of us were sitting in the dining hall, and somebody said, look, out on the lawn. And there was this large cross burning out on the lawn of the campgrounds. And these people came in, and they were all wearing white sheets, and they had these white things over their heads like pillowcases. And they made us all go outside, and there was another guy in a white sheet and a white pillowcase riding up and down on a horse.</p><p begin="00:22:51.24" data-timestamp="1371.24">And they started to yell at us that they wanted the lousy Jews out of Wisconsin and that they didn't want no Jew camps in Wisconsin. And they said, don't bother trying to call the authorities because in this neck of the woods, we are the authorities. And everybody was just petrified.</p><p begin="00:23:07.68" data-timestamp="1387.68">And we all stood around, shaking in our boots, and all of a sudden, one of the counselors said, I'm an American citizen. You can't treat me like this. So two of the guys in sheets grabbed him by the arms and marched him away. And another counselor said, I'm an American citizen. You can't treat us like this.</p><p begin="00:23:28.53" data-timestamp="1408.53">And pretty soon, all the counselors were being marched away, and we were all left there. And I got really frightened. So I went, I'm an American citizen too. And somebody came over in a white sheet and took me down towards the beach. And as he was marching me down to the beach, he said to me, Adina, couldn't you have kept your big mouth shut? And it was all a political lesson that we were supposed to be learning.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 3</h4><p begin="00:23:57.76" data-timestamp="1437.76"> Anyway, I was seven, and it was church camp. And several men dressed in black holding machine guns entered the chapel at different areas. They immediately tied the hands of the four pastors on stage and held a gun on the main pastor.</p><p begin="00:24:17.23" data-timestamp="1457.23">I think as soon as the man said, if you're a Christian, stand up, the devoted stood, and the rest just ran off. And there were kids running all over the woods. And as we walked to our cabin, we saw counselors with flashlights and bullhorns proclaiming it was only a play. We heard kids yelling and cursing and crying, and it was pretty bad.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:24:47.80" data-timestamp="1487.8"> Thanks to everybody who called.

One of the cofounders of the Boy Scouts of America ran a camp in 1901 in which he organized boys into a make-believe tribe called the Sinaways. The Red Man is the apostle of outdoor life, he wrote back then. His example and precept are what young America needs today, above any other ethical teaching-- Indianness and a real connection to nature, an appreciation for all that was being lost with industrialization and urbanization.</p><p begin="00:27:36.52" data-timestamp="1656.52">Just one generation after Custer's Last Stand, fake Indianness was an integral part of the early Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts organizations in this country. By 1910, camps with names like Camp Minnewawa, Camp Miramichi, Camp Pokanoket were springing up everywhere for middle-class and upper-class children. It is still a big part of camping all across America. And after a year without powwow, Camp Lake of the Woods brought the powwow back.</p><p begin="00:28:07.86" data-timestamp="1687.86">Most of this simply has to do with tradition. The special songs and ceremonies are a part of so many American camps, and it's not just because they're fun. A camp director in Wisconsin told us as we were putting together today's program that, financially, you cannot run a camp without lots of repeat customers. These traditions bring kids back year after year. You have the kids singing constantly about their loyalty to their cabinmates and their camp. You let them know about all the extra rights and privileges and honors that they're going to get if they return as older campers.</p><p begin="00:28:38.44" data-timestamp="1718.44">It is part of making the business run. And in addition, it's part of what makes camp thrilling. It is using all of the stagecraft that all the world's religions have always used, the ceremonies, the chanting, the repeated words, the official honors and offices, but for an entirely secular purpose-- to thrill children, to make them feel part of something big and special.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl 1</h4><p begin="00:28:59.34" data-timestamp="1739.34"> I think it's a really important part of camp. I mean, I personally-- I like the traditions because you know what's going to happen, and you can trust things that--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl 2</h4><p begin="00:29:09.98" data-timestamp="1749.98"> You expect it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl 1</h4><p begin="00:29:10.70" data-timestamp="1750.7"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl 3</h4><p begin="00:29:11.42" data-timestamp="1751.42"> I come back for the traditions.

  <h3>Act Five: How The Israeli Army Is Just Like Summer Camp</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:29:47.42" data-timestamp="1787.42"> It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's program, Notes on Camp-- summer camp. A lot of the pleasure of being in camp is the pleasure of being part of this team, this group that you just feel loyal to, which also happens to be one of the pleasures of being in the military, since ancient times.</p><p begin="00:30:10.03" data-timestamp="1810.03">Well, Adam Davidson is half Israeli, grew up in America. And when he was 15, he went to a camp run by the Israeli Army in Israel on their own training facilities. The campers ran the same drills. They shot M16s. It was all designed to convince these American Jews to move to Israel and join the Israeli Army someday.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:30:28.18" data-timestamp="1828.18"> It's so exciting because you really feel-- I mean, you know-- that at that age, when you're 15, and you're in Israeli Army summer camp, there is no one in the history of the world who is cooler than an elite army unit soldier. I loved the fact that we would go to the bathroom, and the toilets wouldn't have a seat because that's a place where terrorists could put a bomb. And it just felt so macho crouching on top of the seat and showering in this freezing cold water. Because what? (IN ISRAELI ACCENT) A Sayeret Matkal would need hot water? Why?</p><p begin="00:31:02.67" data-timestamp="1862.67">Now for me, for the first few weeks, what was tough about this was that I was really a nobody there, and I'd always be bringing up the rear. I'd always be kind of slow. And I wasn't showing myself to be macho even though there were so many opportunities in a given day to prove yourself macho.</p><p begin="00:31:28.45" data-timestamp="1888.45">I mean, we were always, for no apparent reason, running like crazy from one tree to another tree, or up some mountain every few minutes, or something you could be the best at. And I was never the best.</p><p begin="00:31:51.44" data-timestamp="1911.44">But all of this changed. My geek status was completely transformed. One night, the different units would put on plays, and we were supposed to do take-offs of fairy tales. And this was some kind of a competition. There was voting over who did the best job.</p><p begin="00:32:14.75" data-timestamp="1934.75">So my group, [INAUDIBLE], our fairy tale was Steve White and the Seven Dwarfs. And I would be Steve White, this fabulous gay man who lives with these seven dwarfs, and the prince who comes to rescue me would be Rambo.</p><p begin="00:32:36.39" data-timestamp="1956.39">This was one of those moments where I just knew that I was in the zone. I was in my element. I mean, I was from Greenwich Village. I had been an actor all through my childhood. My dad was an actor.</p><p begin="00:32:52.57" data-timestamp="1972.57">But more than that, there's a way that Americans can be very free that Israelis can't be, precisely because they have to be macho. And no matter what they're doing, even if they're mocking themselves, they have to maintain that studliness. And I had no obligations in that area.</p><p begin="00:33:17.44" data-timestamp="1997.44">I dressed myself just-- I tried not to be too outrageous, but I had to be kind of outrageous for them to get it. So a little bit of rouge, a little bit of eyeliner, my hair kind of slicked back with mousse, and sort of ridiculously short shorts.</p><p begin="00:33:33.73" data-timestamp="2013.73">And so I'm lying there, and I hear a knock on the door. And I just stand up, and I remember the entire crowd is howling, just howling. And I just do the most awful, mincing gay voice, just who is it?</p><p begin="00:33:59.38" data-timestamp="2039.38">And my friend, who was a skinhead from Toronto whose parents happened to be Israeli, says, it's Rambo. And I say, oh, Rambo, you sexy beast. And everyone is freaking out, just laughing like mad, like maniacs. And of course, throughout it all, I'm making jokes about the camp members themselves, like saying, oh, I think Commander Oloney is just the thing. And everything I say, the entire crowd is just with me, is just laughing hysterically.</p><p begin="00:34:36.58" data-timestamp="2076.58">And what happens to Snow White-- to Steve White-- I eat the apple, I pass out, and I need to be resuscitated. So Rambo comes to kiss me, and what we had worked out is he put his hand in front of his mouth, and I put my hand in front of my mouth, and we just touched hands. And we'r kissing our mouths, but from a distance, it looks like we're making out.</p><p begin="00:35:01.48" data-timestamp="2101.48">And I mean, at this point, the camp, they're standing up, they're howling. I mean, I have transgressed every boundary that the Israeli man sets for himself, and they are loving the other side.</p><p begin="00:35:22.81" data-timestamp="2122.81">And from that point on, I was no longer the unknown American bringing up the rear of the obstacle course. I was like a movie star. I mean, everyone-- the Israeli guys, particularly the macho-est, toughest Israeli guys, constantly wanted to do this make out thing where we put our hands over our mouths and make out.</p><p begin="00:35:48.37" data-timestamp="2148.37">We'd be relaxing after some really long hike in the Negev Desert or something, and Nehtyu or Shaoul or whatever would come up to me and say, (IN ISRAELI ACCENT) it's very funny the way you do this make out thing. Show me do it. Let's do it.</p><p begin="00:36:05.33" data-timestamp="2165.33">And the first few times I would do it. I mean, I guess part of me was flattered that, like, the macho future Sayeret Matkal guys were into me in any way. But after a while, it was just so weird. I'd just be like, look, Shaoul, I'm just not going to do that. I don't do that anymore. I'm just not going to do it. And they'd be like, (IN ISRAELI ACCENT) why not? Do it. It's very funny, that's all. It's not for anything, but just the funny.</p><p begin="00:36:33.26" data-timestamp="2193.26">Now, I've been to plenty of camps, and in every camp, you're somehow a part of a team. I remember in Boy Scout camp when I was at horse riding camp, it was the people who rode horses in the morning versus the people who rode horses in the afternoon. And I just loved my guys, and I would look in the lunchroom at the other bunk and just-- I just didn't understand how you could even live in that bunk.</p><p begin="00:36:54.45" data-timestamp="2214.45">But Israeli Army summer camp is the purest distillation I've ever seen of this joy in being a part of the group. Every week, I would do things that I wouldn't have thought I could possibly do, and that was so incredible. And I knew that was because of the group. I knew that was giving me the force. And there was never a moment where I had to ask myself, can I do it? It was just, we're doing this. [INAUDIBLE] is going to do this.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:37:34.75" data-timestamp="2254.75"> Adam Davidson is now a member of our <i>Planet</i> <i>Money</i> team.

  <h3>Act Six: Color Days</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:37:46.06" data-timestamp="2266.06"> Note on Camp number six, Color Days. It is impossible to overstate what a big deal Color Days is at the camp in Michigan Julie Snyder and I visited. It is like any Color Wars at any camp, except that it's three days, and once you're assigned a team-- a Blue team or a White team for girls, Black or Red for boys-- you will stay on that team all your years at camp. There are legacies. Your brothers and sisters will be on the same team as you are.</p><p begin="00:38:09.58" data-timestamp="2289.58">Being named a captain of the Color Days teams is considered such a big deal that many older campers can name all the captains of all their Color Day teams going back years. Two girls and two boys are named as captain each year for each team. Only campers from the oldest bunks can be captain. Bryn Mawr is for girls, Mohawks and Blackhawks for boys.</p><p begin="00:38:27.13" data-timestamp="2307.13">Counselors who were once named as captains, if you talk to them about it, they get all choked up when they tell you about the moment they were chosen. Even Dayna Hardin, the 29-year-old owner of the camp, went into this long explanation of the ceremony with me at one point, her voice cracking, ending with--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dayna Hardin</h4><p begin="00:38:40.99" data-timestamp="2320.99"> Oh, I'm almost in tears right now. [LAUGHS] I really am, because, I mean, it was the biggest honor in my life.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:38:47.68" data-timestamp="2327.68"> Julie Snyder watched the girls Color Days this year.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Julie Snyder</h4><p begin="00:38:50.47" data-timestamp="2330.47"> Just to give you a sense of the intensity of Color Days, a month before it all begins, an 11-year-old Blue team member tells me Color Days isn't all that competitive. I mean, she'd talk to a girl on the White team and everything. And all I could think was, if you have to say something like that, you know there's going to be trouble. The speculation about who will get the honor of being captain of the Color Days team, the biggest honor at camp, is so intense that, weeks before Color Days begins, Lindsay Sayowitz and some friends in Bryn Mawr East decide to consult Lindsay's Ouija board.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lindsay Sayowitz</h4><p begin="00:39:20.45" data-timestamp="2360.45"> Is anyone here?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl 1</h4><p begin="00:39:21.32" data-timestamp="2361.32"> Hello? Who is this? B-L-A-I-R. Blair.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lindsay Sayowitz</h4><p begin="00:39:27.32" data-timestamp="2367.32"> Our old friend.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl 1</h4><p begin="00:39:28.37" data-timestamp="2368.37"> Blair? We talk to her a lot. OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl 2</h4><p begin="00:39:31.94" data-timestamp="2371.94"> Do you know who the Color Days captains are for girls? Could you name one of them? OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl 1</h4><p begin="00:39:39.02" data-timestamp="2379.02"> A-L-I-S-S-A. Alissa. Alissa Strom.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lindsay Sayowitz</h4><p begin="00:39:47.69" data-timestamp="2387.69"> She'll get it, I bet.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Julie Snyder</h4><p begin="00:39:50.15" data-timestamp="2390.15"> Everyone thinks Alissa's a shoe-in. And the Ouija board also picked Jamie Stream, another favorite, and Lindsay Sayowitz, who, coincidentally, had her hands on the Ouija pointer at the time.</p><p begin="00:40:04.32" data-timestamp="2404.32">Two weeks later, in the middle of the night, all the girls' counselors snake through the cabin area with lit kerosene torches and wake up the girls for the opening ceremonies of Color Days 1998.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Counselor</h4><p begin="00:40:16.04" data-timestamp="2416.04"> Girls, it's time to wake up. Everybody up out of bed. Get a pair of pants on, shoes on. Wake up, [INAUDIBLE].</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Julie Snyder</h4><p begin="00:40:24.90" data-timestamp="2424.9"> Little girls stumble out onto the sidewalks, rubbing their eyes, wearing mismatched shoes and looking confused. Across the way, the Bryn Mawr girls have never even gone to sleep, anticipating this moment when they find out which one of them will be named Color Days captain. They stand with their faces pressed up to the screen door of their cabin, holding hands and silently crying. Counselors with torches lead 120 girls. They march down to the lakefront and surround an enormous bonfire 10 feet high. It looks like some cross between a debutante ball and a Klan rally.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Counselor 1</h4><p begin="00:40:57.07" data-timestamp="2457.07"> We are here tonight to usher in our three days of competition known as Color Days. I call forth the first spirit. Do you hear me, O spirit? Come forth and tell us who you are and why you are here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Julie Snyder</h4><p begin="00:41:13.83" data-timestamp="2473.83"> Like a summer stock Grecian play, one of the counselors dressed in a white toga comes out of the forest and stands behind the fire.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Counselor 2</h4><p begin="00:41:21.12" data-timestamp="2481.12"> I am the spirit of the white. I represent the clouds of a summer's day, white caps in the water, and the dove of peace and purity.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Counselor 1</h4><p begin="00:41:29.79" data-timestamp="2489.79"> What is the message you bring, O white spirit?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Counselor 2</h4><p begin="00:41:33.03" data-timestamp="2493.03"> It is a difficult thought to convey, but rich in meaning in every way. One can't find peace in a world of dream. Each person is a fraction, a part of the team. We have no choice, everyone must belong. If no one is weak, can the team be strong?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Counselor 1</h4><p begin="00:41:50.40" data-timestamp="2510.4"> I call forth the next spirit. Do you hear me, O spirit?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Julie Snyder</h4><p begin="00:41:55.20" data-timestamp="2515.2"> The spirit for the Blue team, another counselor in a toga, appears before the fire and talks about blue and blueness. Candles are lit, and the girls vow to abide by the camp's seven virtues during Color Days. Those virtues? Friendship, determination, sportsmanship, tolerance, enthusiasm, patience, and unity.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Counselor 1</h4><p begin="00:42:14.76" data-timestamp="2534.76"> In order that you may have time to consider carefully the meaning of these next few days, we ask that you now take a vow of silence. Please repeat after me. I will be silent.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Campers </h4><p begin="00:42:26.04" data-timestamp="2546.04"> I will be silent.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Julie Snyder</h4><p begin="00:42:28.14" data-timestamp="2548.14"> Finally, the camp director, Dayna, picks up four whistles, two on a white string and two on blue. This is the moment everyone's been waiting for and guessing about, the moment Dayna remembers so well from 16 years ago when she was at Bryn Mawr. She walks behind all the girls to the last row, where the Bryn Mawr sit, and silently places the necklaces over the heads of the girls selected to be the captains of Color Days 1998.</p><p begin="00:42:55.17" data-timestamp="2575.17">[SOBBING]</p><p begin="00:42:58.67" data-timestamp="2578.67"></p><p begin="00:43:06.66" data-timestamp="2586.66">The chosen girls stand up, sob, and cling to each other. The other girls stay seated, sob, and cling to each other. It turns out the Ouija board was only right about one of the captains, Lindsay Segenreich. Alissa and Jamie looked shocked and heartbroken. There's so much crying, some of the girls can barely walk straight as they stumble back to their cabins after the ceremony. Because of the vow of silence, there are lots of sniffles, gasps, and blowing noses. Color Days hasn't even started yet.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jamie</h4><p begin="00:43:42.78" data-timestamp="2622.78"> OK, for those who don't know yet, I'm Jamie.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lindsay</h4><p begin="00:43:45.84" data-timestamp="2625.84"> I'm Lindsey.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Beth</h4><p begin="00:43:46.98" data-timestamp="2626.98"> I'm Beth.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lindsay</h4><p begin="00:43:48.21" data-timestamp="2628.21"> And we have an awesome team. I'm so excited.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Julie Snyder</h4><p begin="00:43:52.08" data-timestamp="2632.08"> It's the next morning, and the White team has gathered for their first team meeting. The veteran campers are dressed entirely in white-- white shoes, shirts, socks, bandannas. Their faces are painted white. Their hair is painted white. Lindsay and Jamie, the White team captains, are in charge of organizing all the girls, raising their spirits and motivating the team. But it's difficult to hold your first pep rally within the confines of a vow of silence. Under the vow, only team captains are allowed to talk.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jamie</h4><p begin="00:44:19.71" data-timestamp="2659.71"> OK, are you guys excited? Just nod your head.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lindsay</h4><p begin="00:44:22.59" data-timestamp="2662.59"> Just like that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Julie Snyder</h4><p begin="00:44:26.04" data-timestamp="2666.04"> After the flag raising on the first morning, the vow of silence is lifted. And then you realize why it was instituted in the first place. What follows are three days of solid wall-of-sound screaming. The girls cheer at the individual and team competitions. They cheer while standing around and waiting for their events to begin. They cheer on the way to the mess hall, they cheer outside the mess hall, and they cheer on the way back from the mess hall. They have constant team meetings where they talk about the importance of cheering.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lindsay</h4><p begin="00:44:53.28" data-timestamp="2693.28"> You guys, cheering tonight is the most important night to cheer. That's why--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jamie</h4><p begin="00:44:57.39" data-timestamp="2697.39"> Cheer so loud.

And if you don't get it, then you think about, or at least I think about, what I did to not do it and what I did wrong and how I'm not as decent as a person as other people. And it's just-- I mean, it's a letdown, but it's not everything. And that's what a lot of people lose grip of. That's what I always lose grip of, is that it's not everything, as much as it means.

The younger girls and older girls split off. They do track and field events, swimming and boating events, scavenger hunts, and an all-camp songfest. Both teams seem pretty evenly matched, and for the most part, the girls win and lose with grace. Most of the girls I talk with all say Color Days is their favorite part of camp. They like the cheering. They like the games. They like feeling a part of a team.</p><p begin="00:47:05.78" data-timestamp="2825.78">[CROWD CHANTING AND CHEERING]</p><p begin="00:47:09.15" data-timestamp="2829.15"></p><p begin="00:47:11.56" data-timestamp="2831.56">But one night, after an intense capture the flag game, where Blue team pulls it off by one point, one of the White team girls doesn't take the loss too well.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl 1</h4><p begin="00:47:20.07" data-timestamp="2840.07"> White team, can I talk to you for a second?

Usually, whoever wins the relay wins the Color Days. The Blue team gathers at their meeting spot on the go-kart track to organize all of the team members for the race. Certain things are clear. Alissa Strom does the longest run. Carly Siegel always does the math problem. Rebecca Stern rules the pie eating contest. But there are some open spots, which require careful consideration.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl 1</h4><p begin="00:48:25.59" data-timestamp="2905.59"> OK.

Absolutely amazing. Do you have any idea how much it takes to keep up with Lexie?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Julie Snyder</h4><p begin="00:49:36.71" data-timestamp="2976.71"> The relay race goes all over camp. One camper has to wait for the runner with the baton, then jump in the shower, wash her hair, get out, and passes the baton to the next runner, who goes to the waterfront, where a little girl will do 25 jumping jacks with a life jacket on, who then passes the baton to another girl, who goes all the way back to the other side of camp to a cabin, where a camper unmakes and makes a bed. All along the way, the girls are yelling for their teams, jumping up and down, and trying to control their nerves.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl 1</h4><p begin="00:50:03.65" data-timestamp="3003.65"> Oh, I am so scared right now. I am, like, here, but I'm not. I'm, like, somewhere else. Go Blue.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl 2</h4><p begin="00:50:13.34" data-timestamp="3013.34"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Julie Snyder</h4><p begin="00:50:14.78" data-timestamp="3014.78"> As an outsider watching three days of all of this, I have to say what was shocking was how gung ho everyone was. Camp is this unusually safe bubble where kids can let themselves go, crying and screaming and singing. They all buy into this. None of them stands back. Nobody thinks they're too cool for it. Back at school, the rules are completely different. Everywhere the rules are completely different.</p><p begin="00:50:40.09" data-timestamp="3040.09">[CHEERING]</p><p begin="00:50:43.39" data-timestamp="3043.39"></p><p begin="00:50:47.64" data-timestamp="3047.64">Down at the waterfront, the White and Blue teams stand side by side with dueling cheering, waiting for the final leg of the relay race. When the last baton is passed, the two captains from each team have to build a fire under a rope that's suspended between two sticks about 3 feet off the ground. The first team whose rope catches fire and burns all the way through wins the race. Some Bryn Mawr girls have been saving wood for the burn-the-rope since the second day of camp.</p><p begin="00:51:14.79" data-timestamp="3074.79">Tonight, the Blue team has about a full two minutes on the Whites as the runner hands off the baton. The Blue team captains, Carley and Dana, drop to their knees and begin with the kindling. They get only one match a minute as they add twigs and sassafras to the fire.</p><p begin="00:51:28.83" data-timestamp="3088.83">[CHEERING]</p><p begin="00:51:32.01" data-timestamp="3092.01"></p><p begin="00:51:32.92" data-timestamp="3092.92">Soon the White team starts on their fire. The captains' hands are shaking. Both teams are jumping up and down, cheering and hugging. The first pile of sticks to become like a real fire is the White team's, and the moment it catches, tears start streaming down Carley and Dana's cheeks on the Blue team. Both look close to hyperventilating as they lie down on the dirt, their cheeks on the ground, blowing on their fire, crying and frantically moving sticks around. But the White team's fire rises, their rope starts burning, and once it snaps, the race is pretty much over.</p><p begin="00:52:06.95" data-timestamp="3126.95">[SCREAMING AND CHEERING]</p><p begin="00:52:10.35" data-timestamp="3130.35"></p><p begin="00:52:14.72" data-timestamp="3134.72">Girls are jumping up and down, collapsing into each other's arms, sobbing and laughing. The younger girls, it's almost as if their little bodies can't take all this emotion. I watch one girl, about eight years old, who stands off to the side, begins to tremble, and her face gets redder and redder as tears pour down her cheeks. A teammate tries to comfort her. It's OK, she says, we won.</p><p begin="00:52:37.79" data-timestamp="3157.79">It might seem strange, standing in the middle of a hundred crying girls, that most of them will tell you this is the best day of camp. But it's the best day of camp precisely because it's a hundred girls all crying together. If the point of camp is to feel this camaraderie, to feel like you belong to something, that feeling is at its most concentrated during Color Days. This is also the last day of camp.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lexie</h4><p begin="00:53:06.75" data-timestamp="3186.75"> It's strange. It's this whole thing, there's so many things to deal with. And then it's just all jumbled in at once, and it's confusing and-- I don't know.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Julie Snyder</h4><p begin="00:53:19.52" data-timestamp="3199.52"> I talk to Jamie Stream and Lexie Cowurtz. Jamie's been here for seven years and can't come back as a camper again. Lexie starts high school this year, and for her, this isn't just the last day of camp, her last day living in this safe little bubble. In a way, it's her last day of childhood.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lexie</h4><p begin="00:53:36.89" data-timestamp="3216.89"> One camp summer has never meant so much to me now that we're getting older. And I'm so frightened of going into high school that I don't want to leave here anyway, but I'm so secure here. It's such a haven for me that I can't imagine going home.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jamie</h4><p begin="00:54:02.69" data-timestamp="3242.69"> Also, I think it's hard, maybe not for you, but for me, since this is my last year, these are my last, like, three days of ever being a camper. And it's so weird. It's like, this is my last Tuesday at camp. This is my last dinner with my cabin. This is my last time ever being in a cabin with my friends. And that's what's so weird about it because you're just thinking about the last this, last that.</p><p begin="00:54:41.43" data-timestamp="3281.43">I'm kind of scared to go home, in a way, because my friends at home are so different from my friends here, and it's going to be scary.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lexie</h4><p begin="00:54:48.15" data-timestamp="3288.15"> They're so dull. I don't mean that as in like-- I mean, I love my friends to death. But when you think of the things that we go through here, we're not really living at home. We go to school, and we go out. And It's not their fault, but the environment is so different that it's dull living at home.</p><p begin="00:55:16.69" data-timestamp="3316.69">I'm perfectly content here just sitting here getting mail. I don't really care as long as I just-- it's so strange. And I'm going to miss walking-- I was just talking to Lauren [INAUDIBLE] about this. I'm going to miss walking down the path. I'm going to miss the doors slamming. I'm going to miss the overflowing bathrooms. It's unreal that we have to leave.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jamie</h4><p begin="00:55:41.02" data-timestamp="3341.02"> The stupid little things is what you really miss.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:04.90" data-timestamp="3364.9"> Well, our program was produced today by Julie Snyder and myself, with Alix Spiegel and Nancy Updike.
