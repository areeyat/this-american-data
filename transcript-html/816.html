  <h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:01.01" data-timestamp="1.01"> When I talked to Scharlette Holdman, she'd spent 35 years working with defense teams on death penalty cases, including a very high-profile cases. But she hadn't given an interview to the press in decades, ever since an incident where she had a few drinks with a reporter, and said some things she was unhappy to see in print.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scharlette Holdman</h4><p begin="00:00:15.69" data-timestamp="15.69"> And it was so embarrassing. And I thought, well, I either have to quit drinking or quit doing interviews. And I wasn't ready to quit drinking yet. So I quit doing interviews.</p><p begin="00:00:23.96" data-timestamp="23.96">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:00:25.47" data-timestamp="25.47">So this interview is a very rare event for me. I haven't done any kind of interviews with the media since '85.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:32.33" data-timestamp="32.33"> And you are ending the moratorium in this one instance, for this story, why?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scharlette Holdman</h4><p begin="00:00:40.64" data-timestamp="40.64"> Well, a fluffy, red-combed leghorn deserves his moment in the sun-- just the image. And I'm not talking about any chicken. I'm talking about-- you can just picture it, this beautiful Leghorn, his tail perked up, and that red comb, sitting at a rakish angle on his head, and his head cocked to the side. And he looks at you with his little eyes. That's what this story is about.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:20.40" data-timestamp="80.4"> That is not just what this story is about. That is what a lot of today's radio show is about. Back in the early days of our radio show, once a year, during the highest poultry consumption time in the country, which is, of course-- if you about this for a second, you can guess the answer to this. It's the weeks that begin with Thanksgiving, and go through Christmas and New Year's.</p><p begin="00:01:38.44" data-timestamp="98.44">Anyway, during that period, for years on our show, we had a tradition here, where we would devote an entire hour of our program to stories of chickens, turkeys, ducks, fowl of all kind. In an homage to Chicago's poetry slams, which were spread across the country, but were created at the Green Mill Bar on the North side by poet Marc Smith, we named these programs "poultry" slams-- poultry.</p><p begin="00:01:57.42" data-timestamp="117.42">But I just want to be clear, before we begin, the word "slam," we are using that with no malice toward any bird of any kind at all. No birds were hurt, no birds were slaughtered, no birds were slammed in the making of today's program. And we have incredible stories today, incredible enough that at least one woman has ended a quarter-century moratorium on talking to the press to be here with me. And you should too. From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One: Witness for the Barbecue-tion</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:35.69" data-timestamp="155.69"> Act one, Witness for the Barbicue-tion. Scharlette Holdman didn't just get the idea of calling a chicken as a witness in a murder case out of the blue. She was working on this case-- and we're going to call this guy Harry-- and there was no question that the guy had killed somebody. This wasn't about whether he'd done it. It was about what sentence he would get.</p><p begin="00:02:55.22" data-timestamp="175.22">He had sat on death row at San Quentin for 10 years. But Scharlette says he was schizophrenic, with an IQ of 58, and just out of touch with reality.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scharlette Holdman</h4><p begin="00:03:04.42" data-timestamp="184.42"> And one of the things he did-- he wrote messages and symbols on little pieces of toilet paper, and rolled them up in a ball-- and had done this for years on death row-- rolled the little secret messages up in a ball, and then rolled them in feces, his own feces, into little, tiny, bead-sized balls, and put those into the braids in his hair--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:30.20" data-timestamp="210.2"> Oh, my.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scharlette Holdman</h4><p begin="00:03:30.68" data-timestamp="210.68"> --so that they dangled around his forehead.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:32.93" data-timestamp="212.93"> And the things he was putting in his hair, from his point of view, were they communicating some information, the little messages?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scharlette Holdman</h4><p begin="00:03:40.26" data-timestamp="220.26"> Exactly. But he couldn't tell me what the messages were because they were secret. When I would talk to him about his mother, he would tell me she lived in a Coca-Cola can.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:52.20" data-timestamp="232.2"> It's against the law to execute somebody who is so crazy he doesn't understand why he's being executed. And Scharlette said that was true for this guy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scharlette Holdman</h4><p begin="00:03:59.85" data-timestamp="239.85"> When I would say, do you know what's going to happen on the 12th of June, he was befuddled. And with pressure, he would finally say, well, yeah, he thought he was going to be re-upholstered.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:13.77" data-timestamp="253.77"> The state of California did not agree with Scharlette about this guy. They wanted to execute him in 30 days. Scharlette's team was making a last-ditch appeal to stay this execution. Meanwhile, the state was gathering its evidence.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scharlette Holdman</h4><p begin="00:04:26.46" data-timestamp="266.46"> San Quentin sent in a prison psychiatrist to determine, was he competent to be executed? Did he know he was going to be executed? And did he know why he was going to be executed? So the psychiatrist goes and interviews Harry.</p><p begin="00:04:41.52" data-timestamp="281.52">And then the psychiatrist testified in court that not only was Harry aware that he was going to be executed, she was so certain of this because she had played tic-tac-toe with him and Harry had beat her.</p><p begin="00:05:04.05" data-timestamp="304.05">Well, it was so absurd and so outside of any normal experience in a courtroom-- and this was after 30 years of being in death penalty cases in the South, around the world. And I really couldn't believe she had said it. But at the same time, the only image that came to me-- I'm from the South, obviously.</p><p begin="00:05:30.54" data-timestamp="330.54">And growing up, we always went to the Mid-South Fair. And they had a chicken that played tic-tac-toe, that absolutely mesmerized me. And it was pretty clear to me, OK, we've got to find a chicken who can play tic-tac-toe.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:48.48" data-timestamp="348.48"> Scharlette thought-- and this is not a joke. It's not an exaggeration-- she thought that a chicken like that could save this man's life. Jurors, after all, tend to believe the state and its witnesses. And a chicken like that could totally undermine the psychiatrist's testimony, by proving that playing tic-tac-toe doesn't mean that you understand things like why you're being executed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scharlette Holdman</h4><p begin="00:06:09.48" data-timestamp="369.48"> I just knew a chicken would work. It's a sad state. But I think a chicken has more credibility than the defense team did. And I think it would have brought the jury over to seeing us as people, rather than as these obstructionists, who were interfering with an execution. And who can doubt a chicken? Chickens aren't going to lie. Chickens have integrity.</p><p begin="00:06:39.78" data-timestamp="399.78">I had this image of the psychiatrist being on the stand. And I would quietly enter through the wooden doors, as they opened, with this beautiful Leghorn under my arm, and the comb at a rakish angle.</p><p begin="00:07:01.05" data-timestamp="421.05">And as I walked into the courtroom, not saying a word, and quietly took a seat on the front row, the psychiatrist, who we knew because we had investigated her background from New York City, would see a person with a chicken and think, why is that-- oh, my god, no. And that psychiatrist would slowly realize that she was going to have to play tic-tac-toe with a chicken.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:27.90" data-timestamp="447.9"> So you're trying to psych out-- you were trying to get inside the psychiatrist's head--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scharlette Holdman</h4><p begin="00:07:31.74" data-timestamp="451.74"> Exactly.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:31.89" data-timestamp="451.89"> --and make the psychiatrist unravel even before you pull your stunt.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scharlette Holdman</h4><p begin="00:07:34.98" data-timestamp="454.98"> The jury's eyes as awareness overcame her. So it wouldn't work with the frazzled chicken. I didn't want to splotchy, beat-up, tired, exhausted chicken. I wanted a chicken that could capture the audience's attention. In this case, the audience was the jury.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:52.10" data-timestamp="472.1"> Right. You needed a chicken like in a cartoon.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scharlette Holdman</h4><p begin="00:07:55.58" data-timestamp="475.58"> I had to have a chicken that could take on a psychiatrist. It had to be a stand-up chicken.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:02.39" data-timestamp="482.39"> Noted.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scharlette Holdman</h4><p begin="00:08:03.11" data-timestamp="483.11"> So we began to hunt for this stand-up chicken.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:11.60" data-timestamp="491.6"> Well, this task fell to the legal interns. A man was scheduled to die, at that point, in less than two weeks. And they needed a chicken. And they searched the places that you find tic-tac-toe playing chickens, namely county fairs, carnivals. And really, within hours, they found a tic-tac-toe playing goose in Montana. But of course, Scharlette says that was totally unacceptable.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scharlette Holdman</h4><p begin="00:08:33.05" data-timestamp="513.05"> Geese are nasty. They bite you. And I didn't want a goose running around the courtroom, chasing someone.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:39.39" data-timestamp="519.39"> Next was a guy at a roadside stand in Wyoming who did have a chicken. And it did play tic-tac-toe. But he said that flying or driving it to California for the trial would probably upset it so much that he could not guarantee that it would win the game of tic-tac-toe. So he was out.</p><p begin="00:08:55.71" data-timestamp="535.71">Finally, they found a fellow in Arkansas who trains chickens to play tic-tac-toe. And he had a whole list of chickens that he had trained around the country. And he sent the legal team to one of those birds, in San Francisco. That turned out to be a dead end. San Francisco had actually passed an ordinance banning the playing of tic-tac-toe by chickens, as animal cruelty. Fortunately, another chicken on the list was not far from there, at the boardwalk in Santa Cruz. They had their chicken.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scharlette Holdman</h4><p begin="00:09:25.07" data-timestamp="565.07"> So the next step was to convince the Court to let us bring the chicken to court as a witness, as demonstrative evidence, to introduce the chicken, and let the chicken play tic-tac-toe. Now of course, I wanted the chicken to play tic-tac-toe with the psychiatrist. But I realized--</p><p begin="00:09:44.60" data-timestamp="584.6">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:09:46.85" data-timestamp="586.85">--yeah, that most likely, no one was going to let us get away with that. But I did think that any of us, a really healthy group of interns. They knew how to play tic-tac-toe-- so that we could demonstrate to the jury that playing tic-tac-toe did not mean that you were aware of the consequences of your actions.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:07.55" data-timestamp="607.55"> Why wouldn't you be allowed to make the psychiatrist play tic-tac-toe with a chicken? I understand why the psychiatrist would not want to do it. But from a legal point of view, what line does that cross?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scharlette Holdman</h4><p begin="00:10:20.61" data-timestamp="620.61"> Well, evidently-- I agree with you. But the Court felt-- it never addressed the issue of having to play the psychiatrist-- but the Court felt that bringing the chicken into the courtroom to play tic-tac-toe would degrade the dignity of the Court.</p><p begin="00:10:43.96" data-timestamp="643.96">I thought that the dignity of the Court was degraded by executing a mentally-ill person. So the Court denied our motion and said we could not bring the chicken into the courtroom for demonstrative evidence. It ruled against us.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:59.31" data-timestamp="659.31"> They weren't even allowed to show the jury a video of the chicken playing tic-tac-toe. And without a chicken on the stand, without a video of a chicken, the jury found the psychiatrist credible, and ruled to execute Scharlette's client. His life was saved, later, on appeal. And in the years since then, in 2002, the Supreme Court ruled that a person at his level of mental retardation cannot be executed.</p><p begin="00:11:21.90" data-timestamp="681.9">For Scharlette, though, the story stays with her, the story of the chicken, because in decades of doing these capital trials, bringing hundreds of witnesses, it is the greatest courtroom move she ever invented, bringing in the chicken. And she never got to try it. She invented this thing. She never got to try it. It was snatched away from her. Something like that sticks in your craw.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scharlette Holdman</h4><p begin="00:11:45.36" data-timestamp="705.36"> Well, yeah, because I didn't get to do it. But it's also because of the nature and quality of a chicken. When you do this kind of work, when you're down in the worst part-- when you're trying to work for folks that literally, the community wants to kill, it can be pretty discouraging.</p><p begin="00:12:11.37" data-timestamp="731.37">But you have this nice, fluffy Leghorn, brightens up your day-- for John. And all of this-- all of this is not to make light of death as punishment, of people with mental retardation, of people who are mentally ill, or of chickens.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:32.40" data-timestamp="752.4"> Thank you for saying that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scharlette Holdman</h4><p begin="00:12:33.51" data-timestamp="753.51"> Yeah. And no, it's really not. I actually am a member of PETA.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:47.56" data-timestamp="767.56"> Scharlette Holdman in New Orleans. Today's show is a rerun. We first broadcast this story back in 2011. In the years since, capital punishment was suspended in the state of California by Governor Gavin Newsom. Scharlette, this incredible person that I loved talking to, she was called the Angel of Death Row for her work in getting proper legal representation for people on death row. She died in 2017.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act Two: Chicken Diva</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:16.22" data-timestamp="796.22"> Act two, Chicken Diva. Chickens are what we make of them, in lots of ways. If you could possibly need further evidence of that, after that first act, we have this story from Jack Hitt.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:13:29.72" data-timestamp="809.72"> Oddly enough, it wasn't Susan who was obsessed with chickens. It was Kenny, a pal who worked backstage at the 92nd Street Y in New York. His house was filled with chicken cups, chicken masks. He got the whole staff onto chickens, including Susan. For a time there, in the '80s, poultry-related jokes and references became the fast way to get a laugh at the Y.</p><p begin="00:13:50.47" data-timestamp="830.47">I guess most of us are condemned to see nothing more than the easy comedy of chickens. But Susan Vitucci saw something else, their potential greatness, their hidden beauty, their grandeur. One day she glued together some finger puppets for a 10-minute rendition of the <i>Chicken</i> <i>Little</i> story for her nephew. That was 14 years ago.</p><p begin="00:14:10.12" data-timestamp="850.12">Today, it is a full-length opera, enjoyed by a cult following whenever it goes up in a workshop or cafe or small theater. It's still performed with finger puppets. But now it has a complete score, written by a noted composer, Henry Krieger, who did <i>Dreamgirls.</i> The <i>Chicken</i> <i>Little</i> opera he wrote with Susan Vitucci is called <i>Love's</i> <i>Fowl.</i> Needless to say, that's F-O-W-L.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:14:34.59" data-timestamp="874.59"> Well, we were going to start with the opening, [NON-ENGLISH]. We are the Clothespin Repertory Theater. And we have a special singing guest for you, which I don't know--</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:14:47.49" data-timestamp="887.49"> Susan and I are sitting at Henry's baby grand piano. Henry's guest is his Maltese terrier, named Toby.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Henry Krieger</h4><p begin="00:14:53.31" data-timestamp="893.31"> Perhaps Toby would be kind enough to join me--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:14:56.27" data-timestamp="896.27"> Yeah, would he sit on your lap for this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Henry Krieger</h4><p begin="00:14:57.78" data-timestamp="897.78"> --at the piano. Yeah, let's see what we can do.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:14:59.49" data-timestamp="899.49"> OK.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:15:01.49" data-timestamp="901.49"> OK, listen carefully because once Toby gets going, he actually harmonizes with Henry and Susan</p><p begin="00:15:07.62" data-timestamp="907.62">[MUSIC - HENRY KRIEGER AND SUSAN VITUCCI SINGING IN ITALIAN]</p><p begin="00:15:15.21" data-timestamp="915.21">[DOG WHINING AND HOWLING TO MUSIC]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:15:29.71" data-timestamp="929.71"> You may have noticed that this libretto is in Italian, just like a real opera.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Vitucci</h4><p begin="00:15:33.99" data-timestamp="933.99"> Before, it was just a bunch of puppets in a box, with a good idea. And then suddenly, as soon as it went into Italian, it became something bigger than what it had been. And it's because when it's in English, we all know it. And it's really not that interesting. And it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. As soon as it's in Italian, it gives us enough distance that we can come in.</p><p begin="00:15:55.54" data-timestamp="955.54">It makes us-- it's like the lover who doesn't want you. You don't want anybody more than you want the one who doesn't want you. Right? And so it's the same thing.</p><p begin="00:16:09.03" data-timestamp="969.03">[SINGING IN ITALIAN]</p><p begin="00:16:11.05" data-timestamp="971.05"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:16:34.07" data-timestamp="994.07"> You may recall that when you last heard of Little, back in kindergarten, she was just an average barn-door fowl, who had an acorn drop on her head, which she mistakenly understood to be the sky falling. Her alarms excited her friends, Goosey Loosey, Turkey Lurkey, and Ducky Lucky. And they join her for a journey to the king, to tell him the important news.</p><p begin="00:16:53.12" data-timestamp="1013.12">On the way, they meet up with Sly Fox. Little's pals eagerly accept his invitation for dinner, literally as it turns out. Fortunately for Little, hunger is not enough to distract her from her mission. And she tracks on. When she meets the king, he tells her that the sky is not falling. It's just an acorn. So the enlightened Chicken Little returns to her coop. And that's where the story ends.</p><p begin="00:17:17.57" data-timestamp="1037.57">What are we to take away from Little's experience? I'd like to think it's that Little is rewarded with life, precisely because she went off on this quixotic mission, totally in the grip of a wrong idea.</p><p begin="00:17:30.06" data-timestamp="1050.06">[SINGING IN ITALIAN]</p><p begin="00:17:31.91" data-timestamp="1051.91"></p><p begin="00:17:44.88" data-timestamp="1064.88">The children's fable barely figures into the story. It's just one small episode in the life of Chicken Little, now known as La Pulcina Piccola. After the acorn incident, she goes on to become an internationally renowned figure in almost every field imaginable, a diva of politics, academe, theater, art, daring-do.</p><p begin="00:18:04.17" data-timestamp="1084.17">Like Venus, she arrives from some other world, transported on a scallop shell. But the triumphs of her life began after a youthful love affair with a fighting cock ends bitterly. And she consoles herself, as we all do at some point in our lives, by plunging into Shakespeare. She becomes an overnight sensation as an actress, celebrated all over the world for one role, Juliet, Cleopatra, Ophelia?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Vitucci</h4><p begin="00:18:27.88" data-timestamp="1107.88"> The company, then, performs an excerpt-- a recreation of her signature role, which was <i>Richard</i> <i>III.</i> Well, Sarah Bernhardt did Hamlet.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:18:43.38" data-timestamp="1123.38"> Well, there's a great tradition of women playing the men's roles in Shakespeare. But I think <i>Richard</i> <i>III</i> is one of the more rare roles to be played by a woman.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Vitucci</h4><p begin="00:18:51.00" data-timestamp="1131"> Well, that's how adventuresome an actress this chicken was.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:19:00.82" data-timestamp="1140.82"> I can assure you, there is nothing like watching a 4-inch tall finger puppet crying out, "a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse" in Italian. Not to mention that puppet is a chicken, surrounded by a whole supporting cast of poultry and other avian supernumeraries. Susan says that artistically, there's something special about chickens.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Vitucci</h4><p begin="00:19:21.81" data-timestamp="1161.81"> They're a clean slate. You can put anything on them. You can project anything onto them because it's not like they have, to me at least, a very strong personality.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:19:33.30" data-timestamp="1173.3"> Except for La Pulchina. In the opera, she moves into the field of archaeology, masters it, needless to say, and makes a great discovery, the last tomb of Gallapatra, but not before she sails the seven seas, is shipwrecked, gets rescued, but it's by pirates, and then she meets the pirate king.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Vitucci</h4><p begin="00:19:52.50" data-timestamp="1192.5"> As soon as he meets her, he falls in love with her because of her sweet spirit-- because she comes in and she says, here you see a little chicken who, although I'm dripping wet, I'm proud and yellow.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:20:06.43" data-timestamp="1206.43"> Let me repeat that lyric for you in a pure translation.

Susan has written, or as she puts it, translated La Pulcina Piccola's diaries, which detail the other adventures that happen in between those in the opera. There are 60 pages so far, excerpts of which have appeared in Clotheslines, the official fan-club newsletter of the opera. <i>Love's</i> <i>Fowl</i> has a strange effect on people.</p><p begin="00:22:00.92" data-timestamp="1320.92">I didn't understand it until Susan loaned me a videotape of one performance. To be honest, I thought I would be annoyed at the intentional irony and hokiness of the puppets. But there I was, with my three-year-old daughter, who loved the show, watching a plastic bird pantomime one of the simplest human moments, but also one of the most profound, the confession of a great love, in this case, with a Cock Robin.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Vitucci</h4><p begin="00:22:24.04" data-timestamp="1344.04"> The song that she sings as she enters goes, "I am a chicken and ready for love. My heart is as fragile as the egg from which I was born. Treat me gently, and so will I treat you. Together, from earthly love, we will reach for the divine." And then she sings, "I'm a chicken and I can't fly without love. My heart, it is strong as the egg from which I was born," and so forth. And so it is only with Cock Robin that she flies.</p><p begin="00:22:55.54" data-timestamp="1375.54">[SINGING IN ITALIAN]</p><p begin="00:22:57.94" data-timestamp="1377.94"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:23:19.27" data-timestamp="1399.27"> And after they have agreed to fly together and they are soaring in the air, Cock Robin is shot and killed, murdered by a jealous sparrow.

What happens, it turns out, is that you learn just where the thin line is that divides human beings from birds.</p><p begin="00:28:11.02" data-timestamp="1691.02">All right, maybe it's not such a thin line. But it's definitely a line.

And to understand why, to fully comprehend this little culture clash here in America, we have to leave the barnyard for a minute and flashback to something that happened back at Tamara's apartment in the city.</p><p begin="00:30:45.67" data-timestamp="1845.67">Tamara showed me this old red book from the turn of the century, this book with the seal of the American Poultry Association in gold on the front, and then right there, in gold letters--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tamara Staples</h4><p begin="00:30:54.91" data-timestamp="1854.91"> Standard of perfection.

These were show chickens, standing the way that chickens stand in competitions. Then Tamara pulled out one of her own photos to compare, to show me how her poses do not meet the standard in the book.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tamara Staples</h4><p begin="00:31:19.51" data-timestamp="1879.51"> The tail needs to be higher.

Because it's not about personality. It's about breeding.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:47.13" data-timestamp="1907.13"> And so that is that a pose that the owners would want to own a photo of?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tamara Staples</h4><p begin="00:31:52.92" data-timestamp="1912.92"> They're very particular about this. They want to see their bird in the standard-of-perfection pose, definitely, because that's what they've been taught, from 4-H, when they were kids, to do.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:32:06.02" data-timestamp="1926.02"> That's for them.

It takes about 45 minutes to set this up. That 45 minutes includes dismantling and moving a wall of hay that is probably 10 feet high and 15 long. This takes five people. Then in comes the power and the fancy lights and the cloth backdrop that gets hung from a steel pole. The backdrop is ironed first with an iron and ironing board, brought from the city just for that purpose.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tamara Staples</h4><p begin="00:32:47.23" data-timestamp="1967.23"> 11 and 1/2, 11, and an 8 and 1/2?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Assistant Dennis</h4><p begin="00:32:49.39" data-timestamp="1969.39"> Yeah, 11 and 1/2-- your test is going to be at 11 and 1/2, 11, and 8 and 1/2.

Things go well for a while. She gets a half dozen good shots of the bird, expressive shots, more personality than standard of perfection, George tells me. The bird's chest isn't high enough. Its body is not turned correctly to the camera. And then the bird stops cooperating. He gets tired.

So we're done with this background and--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:35:33.62" data-timestamp="2133.62"> Not standard of perfection. Even these perfectly-bred Cornishes could not achieve standard of perfection today. And even in this goofy, unbirdlike situation, an hour of watching them makes clear just how hard it is to ever get birds to hit the standard, which is to say, not only do we completely dominate every aspect of the lives of chickens, their birth, their feed, their eggs, their slaughter, not only have we bred them to human specifications to meet human needs, but we have created a standard of what it means to be a chicken that most chickens can never meet.</p><p begin="00:36:08.42" data-timestamp="2168.42">That's what the standard means. We judge them as chickens. And we find them lacking. If they had the brains to understand this, they would be right to feel indignant.</p><p begin="00:36:19.58" data-timestamp="2179.58">But of course, this is a city person's perspective. And that means that it is completely wrongheaded from the point of view of anybody who actually raises birds. Standing in the cold feed room, I had a long, long talk with George about this. George is 80 years old. He's been raising birds since the-- I guess the Calvin Coolidge administration. And he says the whole fun of raising birds is raising them to the standard.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>George Cairns</h4><p begin="00:36:42.36" data-timestamp="2202.36"> Well, for instance, if your birds lack bone, OK, you go out and buy a bird as near to like them as you can with better bone. But when you mate them together, you might get long-legged birds or too short or-- you don't get what you want just by mating. It takes four or five years to gradually get it up.

  <h3>Act Four: Winged Migration</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:44:38.43" data-timestamp="2678.43"> Act 4, Winged Migration.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kathie Russo</h4><p begin="00:44:41.37" data-timestamp="2681.37"> So it was Saturday, January 10, 2004. And Spalding was in our apartment, in New York, with our daughter, Marissa, who was 16 at the time, and Theo, who was six.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:44:52.50" data-timestamp="2692.5"> This is Kathie Russo. Her husband was Spalding Gray, who is best known for delivering monologues on stage, like <i>Monster</i> <i>in</i> <i>a</i> <i>Box</i> and <i>Swimming</i> <i>to</i> <i>Cambodia.</i> Both those monologues were also filmed as movies.</p><p begin="00:45:03.63" data-timestamp="2703.63">Spalding Gray went missing on January 10, 2004. Witnesses say they saw him on the Staten Island Ferry that night. His body was finally found, pulled out of the East River two months later. Our program today is about birds and the hold they have on us. And Kathie Russo tells the story about Spalding's last night and the days immediately after that.</p><p begin="00:45:24.39" data-timestamp="2724.39">Like she just said, her husband was with two of their kids that night. She was out. They have a third child, Forrest, who was 11 at the time. He was in Sag Harbor, Long Island, with friends and a babysitter. They had a house out there too.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kathie Russo</h4><p begin="00:45:36.00" data-timestamp="2736"> Spalding had had dinner with the kids. And then it got to be about 7:00 PM. He said he was going to meet an old friend. And Marissa goes, oh, that's fine. I'm here. I can watch Theo. And he went out. And about an hour and a half after that, he called to check in on the kids. Theo answered. And he said, how's everything going? He goes, good. He goes, well, I love you very much and I'll be home soon. And we never saw Spalding again.</p><p begin="00:46:06.51" data-timestamp="2766.51">The next series of events still seem like a blur to me, even five years later. But the first thing I had to do was go report Spalding missing. I did that. And then I decided to send the kids home, back to Sag Harbor, to join their brother. So I stayed for two days, did whatever I could, which was pretty much nothing. And after two days, I just decided, I'm going back to Sag Harbor to join all the kids.</p><p begin="00:46:32.86" data-timestamp="2792.86">So I'm driving on the Long Island Expressway, back to Sag Harbor. And I get a phone call on my cell phone. And it was Theo. And he was all excited. And he said, Mom, Mom, we came home today from school, and there was a bird, a little bird, flying around the island in the kitchen.</p><p begin="00:46:50.20" data-timestamp="2810.2">I said, and then what did you do next? And he said, well, we followed the bird. And Marissa followed him into the bathroom. And she tried to calm the bird. And she took a hat and cupped it over the bird and captured the bird and went outside and let him out free. And I was just so dumbfounded and awestruck.</p><p begin="00:47:13.25" data-timestamp="2833.25">The first image that came to my head, when he said that there was something-- a bird, in particular, circling over this island-- was I thought of Spalding and how for the last two years, he had obsessively circled around that island, talking to himself, just circling and in total anguish.</p><p begin="00:47:33.90" data-timestamp="2853.9">You see, two years before that, we had been in Ireland, celebrating his 60th birthday. And the second day there, Spalding and I were in a horrible car accident. Spalding suffered enormous head trauma. He was never the same.</p><p begin="00:47:51.52" data-timestamp="2871.52">They actually had to put titanium plate in his head. He was in and out of hospitals for two years after the accident. Doctors prescribed various cocktails of pills for him. Nothing worked, not even the 20 electric-shock treatments that he had.</p><p begin="00:48:10.00" data-timestamp="2890">And the second thought I had, when I heard about the bird was, was this a message from Spalding? Was he trying to tell us something? We've never had a bird in our house before. And I remember the Irish have this saying that if you find a bird in your house after someone dies, and it's alive, the person's soul is free. And if you find a dead bird, the person's soul is restless.</p><p begin="00:48:36.80" data-timestamp="2916.8">And I remember Spalding-- I'll never forget the story-- after his mother killed herself 35 years before, his father woke up the very next day, and next to his bed, where his slippers were on the floor, was a dead bird. And that story just stayed with me.</p><p begin="00:48:54.01" data-timestamp="2934.01">So that night, after the kids went to bed, I went around the house, and I was making sure that another bird could not get into this house because I wasn't going to take the chance of another bird coming into the house and dying. So I checked all the windows and I closed all the fireplaces to make sure, to guarantee, that there was no way a bird could come into our house.</p><p begin="00:49:14.44" data-timestamp="2954.44">And the next day, I was at the dining-room table, reading the paper. And I looked up. And there was a bird across the table, peering at me. And I just couldn't believe what I was seeing. So I yell out to the kids, who were in the other room. And they run in, and the bird takes off and flies up the stairs. And we all follow it.</p><p begin="00:49:38.13" data-timestamp="2978.13">And it goes into what's our office. And it's perched on top of this window. And I shut the door behind me. And for some reason, I held up my hands, thinking the bird might magically come to my hands. And I go, Spalding, it's OK. You're safe now. It's OK. Come to me.</p><p begin="00:50:01.98" data-timestamp="3001.98">And Forrest and Theo are on the other side of the door going, Mom, why are you calling the bird after Dad? And the bird just sat there, staring at me. And then it took off. And it flew over my hands. And in between the space in between the door and the floor, it scooted out, went past the boys, flew down the stairs-- and we had already opened up the kitchen doors-- and it flew out the kitchen doors. And it was safe. And it was gone.</p><p begin="00:50:33.55" data-timestamp="3033.55">The next day, I'm in the kitchen. And Forrest calls out from the TV room-- he was watching cartoons. He goes, Mom, the bird's back. It's at the end of the couch. So before I even go into the room, I open up the kitchen doors just to make sure we have an exit for the bird. And I run into the family room. And sure enough, there's the bird.</p><p begin="00:50:55.02" data-timestamp="3055.02">And it's become a drill now. This is the third day, consecutive day, with the bird in our house. And we follow the bird around. And this time, it goes through the living room. And then it comes back into the kitchen. And I actually got the camera out. And I took a picture of it. And the bird flew out. Just like that, it was gone. And two months later, they found Spalding's body in the East River.</p><p begin="00:51:23.67" data-timestamp="3083.67">I think with suicide in particular, it's a really hard death to digest. There's a lot of guilt. You go back and back, and you get into that mode of, I should have done this, I could have done that. It's a seesaw of guilt and forgiveness.</p><p begin="00:51:45.28" data-timestamp="3105.28">So last year was my 47th birthday. And I was feeling blue. And I was really missing Spalding. And I went on this bike route that the two of us used to take together. And it ends up by the water. And just before I got to the water, I saw this little brownish-gray bird sitting on the side of the road, just like the one that we had in our house.</p><p begin="00:52:07.94" data-timestamp="3127.94">And I passed by it on my bike. I ride pretty fast. But something told me, go back. And I did. And the bird was just sitting there. And I'd get up close to it, and didn't fly away. So I figured the bird was hurt.</p><p begin="00:52:19.73" data-timestamp="3139.73">And I'm looking at the bird, crouching over it. And this jogger goes by me, and he said, oh, that bird was there two hours ago when I started my run. So I raced back home on my bike. And I went into the house and I collected a shoe box and I filled it with grass and birdseed, got some rubber gloves.</p><p begin="00:52:38.60" data-timestamp="3158.6">And I drove back to where the bird was. And the bird was still there. It was about a mile from my house. And it's just looking up at me. So I thought it was really hurt. And I tried to scoop it into the shoe box. And it just gets up, looks at me, and flies away. There's nothing wrong with it. Wings were fine. I saw it flying off into the distance.</p><p begin="00:53:01.22" data-timestamp="3181.22">And I thought-- it just hit me like a ton of bricks, right at that moment, there was nothing I could do to save this innocent little bird, which in the end, he was fine. He flew away. And there was nothing I could do to save Spalding.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:18.44" data-timestamp="3198.44"> Kathie Russo, these days she's a producer on the podcast, <i>You</i> <i>and</i> <i>Me</i> <i>Both</i> with Hillary Clinton and the executive producer of the podcast <i>Here's</i> <i>the</i> <i>Thing</i> with Alec Baldwin.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:53:57.32" data-timestamp="3237.32"> Well, the various stories in today's rerun were produced by Alex Blumberg, Susan Burton, Ben Calhoun, Blue Chevigny, Jane Marie, Sarah Koenig, Jonathan Menjivar, Lisa Pollak, Brian Reed, Robyn Semien, Alyssa Shipp, Julie Snyder, Alix Spiegel, and Nancy Updike.</p><p begin="00:54:08.90" data-timestamp="3248.9">Music help from Mr. John Conners.
