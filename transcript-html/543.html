  <h3>Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.53" data-timestamp="0.53">Someone who works with our radio show, Bianca Giaever, went to this presentation at Columbia University a while back where two people onstage puzzled over this thing they had found online called Wake Up Now. And I say "thing they found online," because the whole point of their presentation was it was hard to tell exactly what it was.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:00:21.65" data-timestamp="21.65">Why do some people live their lives in black and white while others seem to live in vibrant color? Well, part of it is knowing a secret, a secret that changes how people see the world. This video is your invitation to WakeUpNow.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:35.90" data-timestamp="35.9">This is a video that was on WakeUpNow's website, which just looked like a kind of generic corporate-y website. And WakeUpNow seemed to be a company. But it was hard to tell exactly what the company did. This site talked about joining, about becoming a member, about living a better life. So was it a club? Was it an organization?</p><p begin="00:00:55.22" data-timestamp="55.22">And then, when you googled WakeUpNow, there were tons of videos. Bianca saw some at the presentation at Columbia. And then, after the presentation, she started Googling on her own. And then, she sucked one of our producers, Brian Reed, into the vortex with her. Here is one of the videos they found.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:01:11.72" data-timestamp="71.72">Hey, we're here in Cancun with the greatest team in the world, WakeUpNow. You should have been here. All the leaders are here. We're having fun. Beautiful island.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:18.77" data-timestamp="78.77">This is a video of a bunch of young people hanging out on the beach. You can see jet skis and the ocean. In the video, they refer to this as a leadership summit. And there was a whole genre of videos just like this, people in exotic locations, riding around in nice looking cars or, in this one, spelunking in a cave in Mexico, chanting.</p><p begin="00:01:35.69" data-timestamp="95.69">[MUSIC - "LA BAMBA"]</p><p begin="00:01:37.60" data-timestamp="97.6"></p><p begin="00:01:41.43" data-timestamp="101.43">That is, of course, WakeUpNow with "La Bamba." And then, there were a lot of videos with the word "scam" in the title, like "WakeUpNow is a scam, for real exposed truth." And so, these two producers on our staff were like, oh, so this is some kind of internet scam. But then, when they watched the videos, it seemed very different. Like, take this one for example titled, "WakeUpNow Warning, Don't Join Until You See This."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 2</h4><p begin="00:02:09.80" data-timestamp="129.8">WakeUpNow is one of the most legitimate companies out there. The reason why is because--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:15.74" data-timestamp="135.74">So "WakeUpNow Warning, Don't Join Till You See This" is actually not a warning at all but entirely about how great WakeUpNow is. And in fact, there were so many videos like this, a video called "Five Reasons Not to Join WakeUpNow" offered not a single reason why not to join WakeUpNow, but instead went on to describe what a super awesome company it is.</p><p begin="00:02:36.36" data-timestamp="156.36">So I'm joined in the studio right now by the two producers who were watching all these videos, Brian and Bianca. Hi, guys.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:02:41.93" data-timestamp="161.93">Hi.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:02:42.44" data-timestamp="162.44">Hey.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:42.95" data-timestamp="162.95">So at that point, as best as you could tell, what was WakeUpNow?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:02:47.42" data-timestamp="167.42">We honestly didn't know. Like, we couldn't figure it out. We eventually put some research in. We learned that, later, this move, the scam thing--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:56.00" data-timestamp="176">You mean labeling videos "Such and Such is a Scam"?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:02:58.58" data-timestamp="178.58">Yeah, exactly that. And then, having it not actually talk about it being a scam. So that's a move, I guess, that some people who are involved with certain companies or selling certain products will do. Like, that's a thing, I guess. But I'd never seen a video like that before. And it was really confusing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:03:14.45" data-timestamp="194.45">I mean, in so many of these WakeUpNow videos, we could tell people we're pitching something. But as far as we could tell, it wasn't a product.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Panama</h4><p begin="00:03:20.54" data-timestamp="200.54"> (SINGING) Build a bank, ah! I say, I say, I say, you need to build a bank, ah!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:27.02" data-timestamp="207.02">So what is this?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:03:28.06" data-timestamp="208.06">This is a video of a guy who calls himself Panama. And it's titled "WakeUpNow Scam, Lend a Hand, Build a Man, Woman."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Panama</h4><p begin="00:03:36.68" data-timestamp="216.68">What are you doing? Eating carrots? Tomatoes? [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:03:49.89" data-timestamp="229.89">So yeah, it wasn't really clear what WakeUpNow was. But still, there were hundreds of these videos. It was like this whole subculture with all these people, about thousands of people.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:59.03" data-timestamp="239.03">OK, so then, I know what happened next is that you found out that WakeUpNow had a conference coming up, right?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:04:02.81" data-timestamp="242.81">Yeah, and we went to try and figure out what this was.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:04:05.89" data-timestamp="245.89">Yeah, and what we eventually found out is that it's something called "network marketing." It's a network marketing company. But also what we found out is that that is a very bland term for something completely mind-blowing, way beyond anything we could have imagined.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:19.89" data-timestamp="259.89">So today on our radio program, Wake Up Now. If nothing else, I have to say, that is a completely genius name for a company. It promises so much so efficiently. That you'll open your eyes. You're life will be totally different, totally better.</p><p begin="00:04:34.37" data-timestamp="274.37">And so, today, as New Year's approaches, as lots of people take stock of who they've been and make resolutions about who they want to be, we have stories of people in very different contexts who try to wake up and wake up others. Stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One: Something’s Happening Here and You Don’t Know What It Is</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:57.83" data-timestamp="297.83">Act 1, Something's Happening Here and You Don't Know What It Is. So Brian and Bianca headed to WakeUpNow's conference in New York City at a hotel in Times Square to try to figure out what this was. Here they are, Brian and Bianca.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:05:12.02" data-timestamp="312.02">I'm a little embarrassed to admit this. But even after being at this conference for several hours, if you put a gun to my head and asked me what WakeUpNow is, what it does, I still don't think I could have told you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:05:22.10" data-timestamp="322.1">We talked to dozens of participants. And what we learned is that people were incredibly excited about something they weren't terribly good at explaining.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 1</h4><p begin="00:05:29.45" data-timestamp="329.45">Why do WakeUpNow? This is a new beginning for the new generation.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:05:33.77" data-timestamp="333.77">What is it? I don't even know what it is.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 1</h4><p begin="00:05:35.91" data-timestamp="335.91">Oh, it's a software company.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:05:38.70" data-timestamp="338.7">It's a software company, you said?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 1</h4><p begin="00:05:40.76" data-timestamp="340.76">I think.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:05:43.49" data-timestamp="343.49">People had come from all over, East Coast, Minnesota, California. They're mostly young and mostly people of color. They called WakeUpNow a lifestyle. They talked about WUN life, W-U-N, for WakeUpNow.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:05:57.09" data-timestamp="357.09">For the longest time, I couldn't even figure out what to call the hundreds of people at this conference. Were they customers of WakeUpNow? Employees? Card-carrying members? Whatever they were, some of them could list specific WakeUpNow products.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:06:09.58" data-timestamp="369.58">And the product is?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:06:11.39" data-timestamp="371.39">Awaken Thunder.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:06:12.99" data-timestamp="372.99">What's Wake and Thunder?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:06:13.78" data-timestamp="373.78">Awaken Thunder. It's--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:06:14.69" data-timestamp="374.69">What is that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:06:15.27" data-timestamp="375.27">--an energy drink. An energy drink.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:06:17.41" data-timestamp="377.41">Oh, so you're selling an energy drink.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:06:19.04" data-timestamp="379.04">We're not selling it. You can buy it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:06:21.67" data-timestamp="381.67">OK. I'm just try-- so are you guys going to work for the company? Or you're buying the product?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:06:27.15" data-timestamp="387.15">Well, we don't have to buy the product. So what you do is you just go around and spread the word about it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:06:35.40" data-timestamp="395.4">But are you selling an energy drink, though? I'm confused.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:06:39.28" data-timestamp="399.28">No, we don't have to sell it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 2</h4><p begin="00:06:41.27" data-timestamp="401.27">The company offers it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:06:42.53" data-timestamp="402.53">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 2</h4><p begin="00:06:43.07" data-timestamp="403.07">The company offers it for you. It's exclusive only for the people that are in WakeUpNow.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:06:48.28" data-timestamp="408.28">So there are products. And these people encouraged other people to buy them. But when we tried to use the word "selling," we were corrected.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 2</h4><p begin="00:06:55.83" data-timestamp="415.83">Yeah, I mean, I don't like saying "selling." I like using "providing." I provide people with it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:07:03.47" data-timestamp="423.47">Do they pay you money in exchange?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 2</h4><p begin="00:07:06.42" data-timestamp="426.42">No, not really. I got a commission from it. That's  about it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:07:11.59" data-timestamp="431.59">Awaken Thunder energy drink was not the only thing WakeUpNow was not selling, but providing. People seemed to be listing a totally random assortment of products.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:07:19.71" data-timestamp="439.71">Lots of things people said WakeUpNow offered were just discounts, off their AT&T phone bills, purchases at Office Depot, on groceries.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 3</h4><p begin="00:07:28.04" data-timestamp="448.04">We have the Trivanis.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:07:29.51" data-timestamp="449.51">What are those?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 3</h4><p begin="00:07:30.08" data-timestamp="450.08">They're like lotion, skin products.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 3</h4><p begin="00:07:31.50" data-timestamp="451.5">And then, we have the coffee.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 4</h4><p begin="00:07:34.25" data-timestamp="454.25">We have cyber-protection.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 5</h4><p begin="00:07:36.23" data-timestamp="456.23">Have you ever wanted to learn another language? well we have a program that has 80 languages, similar to Rosetta Stone.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:07:41.78" data-timestamp="461.78">There's a vacation club.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 5</h4><p begin="00:07:43.04" data-timestamp="463.04">For example, I'm going to Florida. Hotel's usually $1,100. I'm going to pay $290 for the whole week, a condo.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:07:48.35" data-timestamp="468.35">There's tax software.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 6</h4><p begin="00:07:49.19" data-timestamp="469.19">Most people can increase their tax deduction by $3,000 to $6,000 per year, just by the tax part alone.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:07:57.95" data-timestamp="477.95">But in this sea of hard-to-understand information and unrelated products, one thing everyone seemed to agree on, WakeUpNow had a mission.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 7</h4><p begin="00:08:06.95" data-timestamp="486.95">WakeUpNow actually is a financial wellness company, showing people how to save, manage, and make money.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:08:13.40" data-timestamp="493.4">In fact, so many people recited this mission so precisely, it was actually a bit weird.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 8</h4><p begin="00:08:17.89" data-timestamp="497.89">We'll save money, manage money, and make money.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 9</h4><p begin="00:08:19.64" data-timestamp="499.64">Save money, make money, and manage your money.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 10  </h4><p begin="00:08:21.62" data-timestamp="501.62">Save, manage, and make money.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 11</h4><p begin="00:08:22.88" data-timestamp="502.88">Save money, manage money, and make more money.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 12</h4><p begin="00:08:25.25" data-timestamp="505.25">Save, manage, and make money at the same time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:08:30.26" data-timestamp="510.26">It took us all day and, honestly, quite a bit more research afterwards, including signing up ourselves-- which was really complicated-- to piece together how WakeUpNow works. Like I said earlier, they're a network marketing company. And if you haven't heard that term, you've probably heard of Amway or Herbalife or New-Skin, companies where you sell things to people you know. That's network marketing.</p><p begin="00:08:51.83" data-timestamp="531.83">When you join WakeUpNow, you get access to a place on their website called The Hub, which is where you can purchase many of the products and services we heard about. You can join for free. But you're encouraged to sign up on a plan where you pay between $80 and $150 a month. You pay more money, you get more stuff, like the financial management and tax software.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:09:10.77" data-timestamp="550.77">So that's the saving money and managing money part of WakeUpNow. As for the making money part, you can make money by recruiting other people to join WakeUpNow. They buy stuff, you can earn commission. They recruit people, you make money off that too. A chain forms below you.</p><p begin="00:09:27.56" data-timestamp="567.56">That's the network in network marketing. You get three people to join, you get $100. If each of them gets three people to join, that's when the real money kicks in, about $600 a month. There are other ways to earn that money. But that's the one we saw them push.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:09:46.19" data-timestamp="586.19">I know, this may sound like a pyramid scheme. Whether it is one, though, would have to be decided by the courts. We called the Federal Trade Commission. And a spokesman said figuring out if a network marketing company is a pyramid scheme is very difficult and takes a long investigation. The FTC's website says a good tip off that a network marketing company might be a pyramid scheme is that members earn more money for recruiting new members than for selling products to the public.</p><p begin="00:10:15.27" data-timestamp="615.27">WakeUpNow's chief marketing officer told us that 100% of the company's profits come from product sales. But when you pay a monthly fee to join, they consider that a product. He said WakeUpNow is absolutely not a pyramid scheme.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:10:29.86" data-timestamp="629.86">For now though, WakeUpNow members are charging forth, recruiting more and more people into the company and, apparently, getting paid a boatload to do it.</p><p begin="00:10:38.08" data-timestamp="638.08">Boom, boom, boom. Just watch, probably 500K a month walked by you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:10:42.59" data-timestamp="642.59">This guy's pointing at a group of otherwise ordinary looking people. He's talking about all their salaries added together.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:10:48.22" data-timestamp="648.22">500K a month?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 13</h4><p begin="00:10:49.86" data-timestamp="649.86">500K a month just walked by you, under 25-years-old.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 14</h4><p begin="00:10:53.55" data-timestamp="653.55">This company is making history actually. This company is creating the largest amount of under 30-year-old 6-figure-earner that I've ever seen. Look, 6-figure-earner, 6-figure-earner.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:11:07.00" data-timestamp="667">People loved pointing out all the 6-figure-earner magnates among us. In our first few minutes of the conference, I saw this big bearded man. Someone else called him, quote, "a freaking duck hunter guy," which seemed like an apt description. People lined up to take pictures with him. Someone nearby told me why.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 15</h4><p begin="00:11:23.43" data-timestamp="683.43">My boy right here is making $114,000 a month right now, $114,000.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:11:27.91" data-timestamp="687.91">$114,000?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 15</h4><p begin="00:11:29.65" data-timestamp="689.65">$114,000 a month.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:11:32.79" data-timestamp="692.79">His name?

A surprising number of attendees at the conference told us they were planning on quitting to pursue WakeUpNow. These appear to be people with steady full-time E-M-P-L-O-Y-M-E-N-T, a compliance manager at a big bank, a human resources person at Coca-Cola.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:13:47.80" data-timestamp="827.8">And we also met people who had actually done it.

What's not so clear is why they'd choose to leave them for WakeUpNow. When you look at the WakeUpNow compensation plan, which we did later, it actually says in there how many members are making a small profit, 4%. That's it.</p><p begin="00:14:24.99" data-timestamp="864.99">And those 4% are not making a living, just an average of about $600 a month. The number of people making anything close to resembling a living is about 1%. Those are the company's numbers. If they're accurate, presumably 95% of the people chanting in this conference room weren't making any profit whatsoever.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Crowd</h4><p begin="00:14:43.60" data-timestamp="883.6">(CHANTING) WakeUpNow!

A lot of it was about how to recruit people into WakeUpNow.</p><p begin="00:15:04.79" data-timestamp="904.79">I should say, officially, the company doesn't use the word "recruit." But there's no other way to describe what we saw. It was about recruiting. Like this advice from a guy named Rob McFadden. He said that, on the day you launch your WakeUpNow business--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rob Mcfadden</h4><p begin="00:15:17.90" data-timestamp="917.9">You set up a conference call at 10:00 AM. You invite everybody you know to be on that call. On that call, all you tell them is, I'm launching. We're going nuts. I can't even tell you what we're doing. I have a call scheduled at noon. Who's going to be on it?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:15:32.48" data-timestamp="932.48">The next step was to get each person on the 10:00 AM call to bring 10 more people with them to the noon call and, then, to do the exact same thing over again for a 2 o'clock call, all with no mention of what the business actually is. After all--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rob Mcfadden</h4><p begin="00:15:45.08" data-timestamp="945.08">People care more about how you say something that anything you ever say.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:15:50.24" data-timestamp="950.24">The fact that they called this event a business presentation was strange, because there was so little actual business discussed.

But the fact that people were talking about quitting their jobs to do WakeUpNow, when the chances of making any kind of living were so low, that seemed alarming.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:18:55.97" data-timestamp="1135.97">And to our surprise, when we interviewed WakeUpNow's Chief Marketing Officer Jordan Harris, the guy who made the coupon announcement, he said that isn't meant to be the company's message. They don't want everyone quitting their jobs.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jordan Harris</h4><p begin="00:19:06.95" data-timestamp="1146.95">There's an element of any live event, like we have, where sometimes people get up there and they get excited. And there's things that you'd rather have them not say. Our standard advice for people, you should be replacing your income for at least three to four months consistently through WakeUpNow before you consider it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:19:24.59" data-timestamp="1164.59">So on WakeUpNow's Income Disclosure Statement, it says that 4% of members make a profit. Do you think most people who are doing WakeUpNow as a business know that number?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jordan Harris</h4><p begin="00:19:35.06" data-timestamp="1175.06">I think, no question. That is so widely disseminated. You can go pull income disclosure statements from--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:19:41.18" data-timestamp="1181.18">You guys-- like, I don't think you mentioned it aloud at the conference.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jordan Harris</h4><p begin="00:19:45.53" data-timestamp="1185.53">Yeah, we don't mention it aloud. But it's like, it is--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:19:48.38" data-timestamp="1188.38">Why not?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jordan Harris</h4><p begin="00:19:48.53" data-timestamp="1188.53">--on our website, on every-- eh? In a conference, when you're out there talking to them, it didn't come up. We're at a conference. We're trying to have high energy. We're there to have a lot of fun. That's not something that is pitched from stage. But we make sure that everybody is aware of it. I don't know if you saw to stage left. There was an income disclosure statement on the wall. It was in the booklet that everybody got.</p><p begin="00:20:10.55" data-timestamp="1210.55">So everybody left with that income disclosure statement in their hand. We don't want people joining with the idea that, hey, you promised me, if I joined, I would make this amount. That's not what we care about. We care about changing your financial situation from the products. And if you'd like to supplement it by making money, you have an opportunity.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:20:26.12" data-timestamp="1226.12">We told Jordan this wasn't the measured message we left the conference with. Instead, in a room where less than 1% was making any real money from WakeUpNow, we heard speakers spinning a fantasy of enormous wealth, infinity pools, trips to Cancun. One speaker had the crowd shout out their favorite fancy cars, Maseratis and Porsches.</p><p begin="00:20:46.16" data-timestamp="1246.16">Jordan understood why we got this impression. But he says that's not WakeUpNow is really about. He says their company was built around the idea of helping people make an extra $500 or $600 a month and that they chose that number deliberately.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jordan Harris</h4><p begin="00:20:59.96" data-timestamp="1259.96">Because we look at the statistics and the majority of bankruptcies could avoid it if they had $500 more per month. And so, really, if we can get a ton of people that are earning $500 to $600 a month, then for us, that's our sweet spot. We're not encouraging people to just walk away from their own personal income. We're just trying to be something in the middle that helps it be easier every single month.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:21:21.47" data-timestamp="1281.47">Right, but from being at the conference, it just does seem like the messages are not that. They're not, we want to help you live a easier life every month with supplemental income and financial management.</p><p begin="00:21:33.92" data-timestamp="1293.92">The message is much more like, your life is unsatisfactory. You are slave to some job. You don't have your own freedom. And this is the answer to that. The reality of the message I think people are getting is not what you just said. And does that concern you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jordan Harris</h4><p begin="00:21:49.45" data-timestamp="1309.45">Yeah. We want to unify the message from corporate. Like I said, I think you guys caught us right in the spike of our growth where there were so many people that were involved in WakeUpNow that we didn't necessarily have as good as communication from corporate as we could have. But we're a different company than we were eight months ago.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:22:08.34" data-timestamp="1328.34">The conference we went to was in April. Jordan says the company had grown 4,000% over the previous year. And they were scrambling to deal with that expansion. WakeUpNow, by the way, was only founded in 2009.</p><p begin="00:22:19.34" data-timestamp="1339.34">Since April, Jordan says they're running a tighter ship. They recently replaced their CEO. They're rewriting some of their introductory literature, downplaying the recruiting side of things. And they've changed what they say at their events. He says, WakeUpNow has never been intentionally vague. But he thinks we were not unique in our confusion. And that's one of the things they're trying to fix.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:22:43.48" data-timestamp="1363.48">A couple weeks ago, we talked to a guy who studies companies like WakeUpNow, Amway and Herbalife and other network marketing companies. And he said, when reporters talk about them, they usually focus on the money people spend on them, but rarely discuss the part he considers more troubling and more destructive-- what it does to members' personal relationships.</p><p begin="00:23:02.59" data-timestamp="1382.59">This guy's name is Robert L. Fitzpatrick. And he used a word to describe WakeUpNow that may sound hyperbolic. The word was "cult," except not a religious cult.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert L. Fitzpatrick</h4><p begin="00:23:12.61" data-timestamp="1392.61">It's an economic cult. That's the distinction that I think you may be grasping for when you say, what is this thing?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:23:20.92" data-timestamp="1400.92">Robert Fitzpatrick says it's not an accident that it took us so long to figure out what WakeUpNow is, that the videos all seem so vague and the website was so confusing about pricing and products when we signed up as a member. He says, vagueness is part of a strategy companies use. Robert became interested in network marketing after he and some friends got caught up years ago in the frenzy of recruiting people into a gifting scheme.</p><p begin="00:23:43.98" data-timestamp="1423.98">And he says the most disturbing thing about it was how it manipulated their thinking, made them suspend critical judgment. So he spent years researching how network marketing companies work. A regular business, Robert says, doesn't try to tell people how to treat their friends and family, which we saw at WakeUpNow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert L. Fitzpatrick</h4><p begin="00:24:00.07" data-timestamp="1440.07">The intention to isolate you from other people who are not in the scheme-- you are told to shun doubters, critics, even if they're in your family.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Wakeupnow Speaker</h4><p begin="00:24:11.89" data-timestamp="1451.89">And then, when you go around your friends and  they get uncomfortable, like, you buggin'!

And no surprise here. He says that's an unfair characterization. He says, he interprets those moments from the conference differently than Robert Fitzpatrick does.</p><p begin="00:25:32.67" data-timestamp="1532.67">WakeUpNow is not trying to isolate members from their family, he says. But if someone's being negative about your work, he thinks it is good advice not to hang around them. And what's wrong with believing in what you do?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jordan Harris</h4><p begin="00:25:42.83" data-timestamp="1542.83">Look, if you're going to do anything, you better believe that you can do before you start. I think that that is a universal truth. But to portray it as, the only way to be successful is to believe hard enough-- I would much rather have them preface that with, it is not enough to succeed. You've got to have the hard work. And you've got to have the talent to be successful.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:26:07.73" data-timestamp="1567.73">At the conference, everyone was so amped up. It was hard to get a sense of what it was really like to do WakeUpNow day in and day out. So we found someone who'd gone all in on WakeUpNow, who'd quit his job to dedicate himself to it, a guy with a wife and three young kids who recently stopped working in the kitchen of a really nice restaurant to do WakeUpNow.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:26:27.73" data-timestamp="1587.73">His name is Damien Lacks. He's 29 years old. We went to visit him at his apartment in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Damien grew up in a rough part of Baltimore. He was a charismatic kid, a good athlete who did well in school. But he got into drugs, dropped out, did some time in jail. By the time he was 24, he was living in a halfway house in Gettysburg, where he moved to get away from the city, and working at a McDonald's.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Damien Lacks</h4><p begin="00:26:50.62" data-timestamp="1610.62">I didn't know what I wanted to do with life. At the same time though-- and this might sound strange to some people-- even back then, even since I was 10 years old, I've known that I was supposed to do something great. Now, I ain't saying it to boast. I just am giving praise to God. Because that's who he made me. I haven't always lived up to it. I've been terrible at living up to it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:27:15.73" data-timestamp="1635.73">After McDonald's, Damien worked in kitchens at a couple of pubs in town, then landed at a TGI Fridays. But Damien was bored there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Damien Lacks</h4><p begin="00:27:23.95" data-timestamp="1643.95">The district manager would walk in. He wouldn't speak to the little guys on the line. I hated that feeling, feeling like I'm a little guy. And that the big guys, who are already making $100,000 a year, when you come around, you don't even have the decency to say, hey, how are you guys doing in here?</p><p begin="00:27:41.71" data-timestamp="1661.71">You know, we hot. We sweating. We busting our ass. Excuse me. You don't really care about nothing but how the restaurant is running and how much money we're making. You don't care about the people at all. It makes you feel low. No, I hated that. I hated it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:28:02.21" data-timestamp="1682.21">In other words, it was a J-O-B. So he applied to one of the best restaurants in the area, a place called Restaurant Sydney, founded by a chef he admired. Damien was taking online culinary classes. He had dreams of becoming a sous chef, of one day opening his own restaurant. So when Sidney hired him, he was thrilled.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:28:21.07" data-timestamp="1701.07">What were your expectations going in there?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Damien Lacks</h4><p begin="00:28:23.92" data-timestamp="1703.92">The highest level of chefness-- I don't know a better word.

They didn't seem inspired.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:28:49.15" data-timestamp="1729.15">And Damien was only making $10 an hour. After babysitters and gas-- Sidney is 25 minutes from his house-- Damien says his pay was basically a wash. He kept asking for a raise, but wasn't getting one.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:29:00.70" data-timestamp="1740.7">And that's when an Instagram friend sent Damien some of the YouTube videos about WakeUpNow.

Unlike us, though, his reaction was--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Damien Lacks</h4><p begin="00:29:11.89" data-timestamp="1751.89">The video she sent me was so inspiring.

And what it came down to was the positivity. It was a bunch of young people and, in particular, young black people succeeding as entrepreneurs. They were working for themselves, in total control of their own destiny.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 21</h4><p begin="00:29:35.37" data-timestamp="1775.37">What are you doing in your job?</p><p begin="00:29:36.62" data-timestamp="1776.62">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Damien Lacks</h4><p begin="00:29:38.23" data-timestamp="1778.23">To me, it was nostalgic. It took me back to that place, when I was a kid. You dream about where you want to be in your life. And it was like, that's right. That's right. That's what I wanted my life to be. That's right. I'm going after it. Thank you for reminding me. This is my calling right here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:29:57.49" data-timestamp="1797.49">Damien began reading WakeUpNow's literature obsessively. He went on a vacation with his family. And he says, the whole time, he couldn't tear himself away. He compares it to reading scripture. The company's Quick Start Guide includes a whole section called "Your Thoughts can Change the Future." Damien loved that. It talks about feeding yourself positive ideas and filtering out the negative, not hanging around negative people.</p><p begin="00:30:20.29" data-timestamp="1820.29">After that, every dirty joke his co-workers made felt like it was poisoning his mind. Then, after weeks of asking for a raise, his boss told him he wouldn't be getting one. Not long after, Damien quit Restaurant Sidney and devoted himself to WakeUpNow.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:30:42.33" data-timestamp="1842.33">When we visited Damien, he'd been doing WakeUpNow for four months. Here's what a typical work day looks like for him. He wakes up and helps get his two boys off to school. And once they're off, he usually dials into a 10:00 AM motivational group call. But most of the day, he watches his baby daughter.</p><p begin="00:30:59.26" data-timestamp="1859.26">While she's napping, he spends a few hours poking around on the computer, watching YouTube videos about how to present WakeUpNow to people and, then, just kind of being on Facebook. If he starts to feel down, he'll watch an uplifting video. Early on, he tried calling every contact in his phone to tell them about WakeUpNow. That yielded exactly one WakeUpNow recruit.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Damien Lacks</h4><p begin="00:31:19.85" data-timestamp="1879.85">My mom.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:31:21.50" data-timestamp="1881.5">His mom. After four months, she's still the only recruit he has, which means he's not making any income. And in fact, he's paying $100 a month to be part of WakeUpNow.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:31:31.70" data-timestamp="1891.7">What are you going to do if another four months go by and you still haven't gotten anyone and aren't making any money? And you're spending money to be in it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Damien Lacks</h4><p begin="00:31:40.76" data-timestamp="1900.76">Um-- that's a hard question. Because I honestly know that it's going to work.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:31:52.55" data-timestamp="1912.55">We spent a lot of time debating with Damien about this. It was nearly impossible to get him to even entertain the hypothetical of WakeUpNow not working.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:32:00.80" data-timestamp="1920.8">If the year goes by and you haven't made any money with WakeUpNow or network marketing, would you be disappointed?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Damien Lacks</h4><p begin="00:32:06.59" data-timestamp="1926.59">No, I would just keep going.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:32:09.38" data-timestamp="1929.38">Think about that. A year has gone by with no success. You wouldn't feel any kind of way about that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Damien Lacks</h4><p begin="00:32:15.32" data-timestamp="1935.32">A year gone by-- and network marketing is successful. Think about doctors and lawyers. They go to school for four years, eight years, before they actually reach the time when they can get paid for what they've been training for.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:32:27.38" data-timestamp="1947.38">Damien knows the stats, that just 1% of WakeUpNow members make a living. He actually pointed the numbers out to us on his own. But it's almost as if those dismal statistics made Damien even more optimistic about his prospects.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Damien Lacks</h4><p begin="00:32:39.86" data-timestamp="1959.86">I have the persistence to become in the 1%, in the less than 1%. Because it says, the results are not typical. Well, I say, I'm not typical. And the thing about it is, more people could be successful. But more people don't have desire. They're not going to put in the work. And if you tell yourself it's too hard, it's going to be too hard.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:33:02.55" data-timestamp="1982.55">But what if it's not the fact that you're telling yourself that something is really hard, but that it just is really hard? Like, that is the reality, the chances of making money are low. And so, when someone's telling themself that it's hard, they're right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Damien Lacks</h4><p begin="00:33:17.15" data-timestamp="1997.15">It's only hard if you believe it's hard.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:33:23.38" data-timestamp="2003.38">We thought that one person who might be silently freaking out about this was Damien's wife, Candice. Candace has a full-time job managing a store at the nearby outlet mall and is now the sole breadwinner in their family of five. They have two kids, a baby and an eight-year-old, and just became the legal guardians of a third child, a 12-year-old who neither is related to, the son of one of Damien's ex-girlfriends.</p><p begin="00:33:47.61" data-timestamp="2027.61">So we took Candice aside, out of Damian's earshot, to ask how she was dealing with the pressure of providing for three kids while Damien didn't have a job and wasn't bringing in any money with WakeUpNow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Candice Lacks</h4><p begin="00:33:58.56" data-timestamp="2038.56">I'm not as stressed out. I have a lot more help around the house. So my days off, I actually can enjoy instead of having mounds of laundry to do. [LAUGHS] So like, it's really helped us as a family unit.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:34:14.76" data-timestamp="2054.76">This is not the answer we were expecting. But Candice likes her job. And she says that her income is enough to support the family without Damien earning money. She says they're not in financial trouble at all. When Damien had restaurant gigs where he worked long erratic hours, she and the kids would sometimes go days without seeing him. Now that Damien has left the restaurant industry for WakeUpNow, Candice says her kids get to be raised by their father.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Candice Lacks</h4><p begin="00:34:37.96" data-timestamp="2077.96">And it's great. Because, with us adding on another child, getting that child in a routine and working on his homework-- because he is behind, so he needs a lot more help and attention with schoolwork and stuff. It's beneficial right now with the dynamics of our family.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:34:56.56" data-timestamp="2096.56">And Damien's been able to do that with him?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Candice Lacks</h4><p begin="00:34:58.23" data-timestamp="2098.23">Absolutely.

  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:36:44.09" data-timestamp="2204.09">It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>. I'm Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme. Today, with people making resolutions for how this new year will be different from the previous one, our show is "Wake Up Now." I hope you notice how classy we're keeping it here on the show by not inserting alarm clock sounds every time I say those words. Wake Up Now-- stories of people trying to wake themselves up or wake up others.</p><p begin="00:37:05.18" data-timestamp="2225.18">We've arrived at Act 2 of our program, Act 2, Board Games. So there's this thing that comes up in the news pretty regularly, CEO pay. When it comes up, rarely is it good for the CEOs. Usually, the point is that CEOs are overpaid, something needs to be done. If you figure that most people work 40 or 50 years in their work lives, it would take a typical worker four or five lifetimes to earn what the CEOs of large companies earn in a single year.</p><p begin="00:37:32.37" data-timestamp="2252.37">So you hear statistics like that in these stories. But what you almost never hear is anybody actually trying to cut the pay of a CEO. Well, David Kestenbaum and Jacob Goldstein of NPR'S "Planet Money" found a guy who tried to wake people up to the fact of the CEO of one small company seemed to be making way too much money.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:37:50.72" data-timestamp="2270.72">It takes an unusual person to wage a war against a CEO and his pay. The odds of success are just so low. And Tim Stabosz was definitely an outsider.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jacob Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:37:59.60" data-timestamp="2279.6">He lived in a small town, Laporte, Indiana, in a small house. We went to visit. In the dining room, there's a broken Dungeons and Dragons pinball machine. Tim tried to fix it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tim Stabosz</h4><p begin="00:38:10.37" data-timestamp="2290.37">Here it is. Yeah, it's sad. I made a boo-boo when I fried out the display. It was just a disaster.</p><p begin="00:38:18.47" data-timestamp="2298.47">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:38:19.78" data-timestamp="2299.78"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jacob Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:38:20.66" data-timestamp="2300.66">When Tim got out of college, he got a government job and tried his hand at the stock market on the side. He used a computer to pick out stocks he thought were undervalued. He still has that computer. And just so you have the right image in your head, this is the kind of computer you'd find sitting out on the sidewalk. It's got a floppy disk drive. And when you turn it on, it just goes beep.</p><p begin="00:38:39.37" data-timestamp="2319.37">[PRINTING NOISE]</p><p begin="00:38:40.70" data-timestamp="2320.7"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tim Stabosz</h4><p begin="00:38:41.14" data-timestamp="2321.14">That's the dot matrix printer.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:38:44.39" data-timestamp="2324.39">Over the years, Tim did well in the stock market, really well, well enough that he was never going to have to work a regular job again.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jacob Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:38:50.96" data-timestamp="2330.96">Sometime in the mid '90s, Tim came across this one company. He'd end up investing hundreds of thousands of dollars in its stock. It was a small company based on Long Island called P&amp;F Industries. It made pneumatic tools. You can actually buy them at Home Depot.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jacob Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:39:04.85" data-timestamp="2344.85">Have you ever used one of the tools?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tim Stabosz</h4><p begin="00:39:06.68" data-timestamp="2346.68">I don't believe so, no.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jacob Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:39:08.57" data-timestamp="2348.57">Tim just like the company's numbers. It was a small company where you could understand everything about it. P&amp;F seemed like a good deal. But over the years, something began to gnaw at him, the salary of the CEO, Richard Horowitz.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tim Stabosz</h4><p begin="00:39:20.60" data-timestamp="2360.6">Roughly $1 and 1/2 million a year, total compensation.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jacob Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:39:23.93" data-timestamp="2363.93">Is that a lot?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tim Stabosz</h4><p begin="00:39:25.34" data-timestamp="2365.34">$1 and 1/2 million is outrageous and outlandish.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:39:30.35" data-timestamp="2370.35">Tim looked around at similar companies, some in the same industry, some in the same geographic area. And he couldn't find any where the CEO was paid even half of what Horowitz made. Now, if you just own a few shares of a company's stock and you think the CEO is overpaid, there isn't much you can do. But if you own more, well, that's different. And by the fall of 2009, Tim owned 180,000 shares.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tim Stabosz</h4><p begin="00:39:52.52" data-timestamp="2392.52">I came to own 5%.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jacob Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:39:54.29" data-timestamp="2394.29">5% of the whole company?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tim Stabosz</h4><p begin="00:39:55.80" data-timestamp="2395.8">5% of the entire company.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jacob Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:39:57.74" data-timestamp="2397.74">His stake was worth more than half a million dollars. And it turned out, Tim had an ally in this fight, a guy with a little more experience, a guy who ran a hedge fund.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Shapiro</h4><p begin="00:40:07.16" data-timestamp="2407.16">I'm Andrew Shapiro. I'm president and portfolio manager of Lawndale Capital Management.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:40:12.23" data-timestamp="2412.23">Andrew also owned a big chunk of the company, about 8%. He and Tim didn't work together directly. They had very different styles. Andrew was a by-the-book investor, fond of semi-obscure military allusions.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Shapiro</h4><p begin="00:40:25.43" data-timestamp="2425.43">With what we do, we deploy what I call the Powell Doctrine of investments. And I try to take on targets where I can mount overwhelming force.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jacob Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:40:36.11" data-timestamp="2436.11">For years, Andrew had been arguing that the CEO was grossly overpaid. Over one 10-year period, he says, Richard Horowitz took home $13.5 million dollars. That's more than twice what the entire company made in profits over that time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:40:50.00" data-timestamp="2450">Sometimes, when people complain about CEO pay, they talk about it as if the money's coming out of the pockets of ordinary workers. That is not how Tim and Andrew see it. Every dollar the CEO gets is $1 less profit, $1 less for Tim and Andrew and all the other stockholders.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Shapiro</h4><p begin="00:41:05.58" data-timestamp="2465.58">The overpaid CEO's taking money out of the shareowner's pocket.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:41:09.08" data-timestamp="2469.08">You're not in it because, hey, wouldn't it feel great if CEOs weren't paid so much more than everyone else?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Shapiro</h4><p begin="00:41:16.10" data-timestamp="2476.1">I am doing this to make a return on our capital.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jacob Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:41:20.69" data-timestamp="2480.69">This is why, if you think CEOs are overpaid rich guys, your best hope for changing things may be other rich guys, rich guys with enough money to buy up a bunch of stock and take on the company to try and cut the CEO's pay, in hopes of becoming even richer themselves.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:41:42.94" data-timestamp="2502.94">We, of course, wanted to know what the CEO Richard Horowitz had to say about this. We tried to get him. We had a bunch of talks with the company's lawyer. In the end, Horowitz declined to be interviewed. But because this is a public company, there are plenty of recordings of him. Public companies have what are called "quarterly earnings calls" for investors, really anyone who wants to listen.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Operator</h4><p begin="00:42:02.81" data-timestamp="2522.81">Good day, everyone.

And then, here is the man himself, Richard Horowitz.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Horowitz</h4><p begin="00:42:11.89" data-timestamp="2531.89">Firstly, I'm pleased to report that the company's revenue from continuing operations was $14,164,000.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:42:18.76" data-timestamp="2538.76">I've listened to a lot of earnings calls like this over the years. Usually, they are incredibly dull. Analysts from big banks asking super specific things about the company's balance sheet. But remember, P&amp;F is a small company.</p><p begin="00:42:31.38" data-timestamp="2551.38">And on some of these calls, there are only two people phoning in with questions, two people who feel the CEO is grossly overpaid, Andrew and Tim. They get to ask the CEO whatever they want. Here's one exchange.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Operator</h4><p begin="00:42:44.32" data-timestamp="2564.32">Thank you.

It's called a compensation study. It looks at what CEOs at comparable companies are earning. P&amp;F Industries had hired an external firm to do one of these reports. And Tim wanted details.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Horowitz</h4><p begin="00:43:02.11" data-timestamp="2582.11">--a little shocked.

I'm frustrated right now, Richard.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Horowitz</h4><p begin="00:44:11.35" data-timestamp="2651.35">OK, you'll handle it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Operator</h4><p begin="00:44:13.63" data-timestamp="2653.63">Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Shapiro. Your line is open.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:44:19.46" data-timestamp="2659.46">There are a lot of calls like this.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jacob Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:44:27.85" data-timestamp="2667.85">A CEO's salary is set by a company's board of directors. And Shapiro suspected Richard Horowitz had packed the board with his cronies, people who paid him more than he deserved. So Andrew hired a private detective and did some digging himself. He discovered that, in fact, several board members played golf at the same country club as the CEO.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Shapiro</h4><p begin="00:44:46.21" data-timestamp="2686.21">The Glen Oaks Country Club of Westbury, New York. Glen Oaks Country Club of Old Westbury, New York.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:44:54.28" data-timestamp="2694.28">Nothing illegal or maybe even surprising about these guys blowing into the same country club. But still, what would General Colin Powell do? He'd get them off the board. Andrew suggested several potential new board members. And Tim, Tim nominated himself.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jacob Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:45:09.19" data-timestamp="2709.19">Getting new people on a board is tough. There is a vote. But in most cases, the existing board members get to decide who's on the ballot. It's as if members of Congress were the ones who decided who got to run for Congress.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:45:20.71" data-timestamp="2720.71">So Tim and Andrew went to the company's annual meeting to try to convince the board to put their candidates on the ballot. It was the first time Andrew Shapiro and Richard Horowitz, the CEO, had met in person.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Shapiro</h4><p begin="00:45:31.33" data-timestamp="2731.33">It actually was quite crowded. Every seat at the table was full. And there was the paid-for advisers standing around the periphery of the table, in the room, but along the wall.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:45:43.93" data-timestamp="2743.93">Where was the CEO?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Shapiro</h4><p begin="00:45:45.40" data-timestamp="2745.4">Oh, he's sitting directly across the table from me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:45:48.07" data-timestamp="2748.07">Oh, it must be awkward. What's it like?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Shapiro</h4><p begin="00:45:50.68" data-timestamp="2750.68">Oh, it's not awkward or not. I go into these rooms with the distinct view that I am an owner of this business and you members of the board of directors are my agents. And you work for me. You don't work for Mr. Horowitz. You don't work for management. Management works for you, the board. And the board, you work for me and all of the other shareholders.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:46:17.32" data-timestamp="2777.32">The board did not seem immediately swayed by this argument. And it's easy to imagine how this whole thing might feel on the other side if you're, say, Richard Horowitz, the CEO; if you've got two guys who have never even worked in the tool business telling you how they think the business that your father built up should be run and how much you should be paid and who should be on your board.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jacob Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:46:37.54" data-timestamp="2797.54">For Tim Stabosz, what had started out as a rational investment, something just based on numbers, had become emotional, had become something hard to let go of. At some point in this whole fight, Tim's letters to the company took on a different tone. He got rid of the lawyer who'd been vetting them.</p><p begin="00:46:53.53" data-timestamp="2813.53">Some of the letters start to have words in all caps. Some start to feel weirdly intimate. One is addressed just to Richard and uses phrases like, "I was at the end of my rope," and, "goodness knows, I tried a different course."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:47:09.98" data-timestamp="2829.98">And then, in the summer of 2010, more than a decade after Tim first bought stock in P&amp;F Industries, something finally went his way. There was a change on the board. The two guys who played golf at the same country club as the CEO stepped down from the committee that set the CEO's pay.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jacob Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:47:26.13" data-timestamp="2846.13">Also, one of the people Andrew had recommended for the board got put on the ballot and elected.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:47:31.30" data-timestamp="2851.3">And a year and a half later-- if you haven't noticed, this is an incredibly long process-- it finally happened, the thing that almost never happens. The board of P&amp;F did what Andrew and Tim wanted. They cut Richard Horowitz's base salary by a lot, from $975,000 to $650,000, a cut of over $300,000.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jacob Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:47:53.13" data-timestamp="2873.13">It actually made the news, at least a little corner of the news, an article in a publication called "Institutional Investor." An expert in that article said it was the first time he'd ever seen shareholders get a board to cut the pay of a sitting CEO.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:48:07.89" data-timestamp="2887.89">Tim Stabosz, of course, was elated about the pay cut.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tim Stabosz</h4><p begin="00:48:11.04" data-timestamp="2891.04">Well, it felt fantastic. It felt great. It felt like I had served to effect this change, that I was an agent of change.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jacob Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:48:19.95" data-timestamp="2899.95">That feeling did not last. It turns out, that new contract also made it easier for Richard Horowitz to get a bigger bonus. And in 2012, even though Horowitz's base pay had been cut, he actually ended up making more money than he had the previous year.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:48:35.52" data-timestamp="2915.52">And then, earlier this year, Richard Horowitz got a raise. The board boosted his base pay by $50,000.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tim Stabosz</h4><p begin="00:48:41.96" data-timestamp="2921.96">And they also raised the bonus percentages, so he would be able to earn even more on the bonus.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:48:46.86" data-timestamp="2926.86">The company only let us talk to one person on its side of things. But it was someone we definitely wanted to hear from, the board member that Andrew Shapiro had recommended. We met him one afternoon at a business club at the top of a tall building in Philadelphia. His name is Howard Brownstein. And he told us he thinks Richard Horowitz's pay is reasonable.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Howard Brownstein</h4><p begin="00:49:04.50" data-timestamp="2944.5">Yeah, I would say to you that, based on the work that the comp committee did, as they reported it to us and as we listened to it, that the compensation is within the realm of reasonableness for our company and how it's doing and the money we make for the shareholders.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jacob Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:49:20.76" data-timestamp="2960.76">We asked Brownstein about that compensation study that Tim asked about on the conference call, the study that compares Richard Horowitz's pay to the CEOs of other companies. And we read Brownstein this letter Tim wrote, asking the board to release details from the report. "Asked" is probably the wrong word. Tim writes, I demand, in all caps. And then, at the end, also in caps, I have waited long enough. I am done waiting.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Howard Brownstein</h4><p begin="00:49:46.32" data-timestamp="2986.32">Well, Mr. Stabosz obviously hasn't been able to find the Caps Lock key on his typewriter. Look, generally in my world, when somebody demands something, it's because they have a legal right to it. He may say he demands it, but the fact is, he doesn't have a right to it. So what he really meant when he said, I demand it, is I really, really want it. I get it. It's OK. You can't have it. Next.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jacob Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:50:10.59" data-timestamp="3010.59">He's one of the owners of the company, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Howard Brownstein</h4><p begin="00:50:12.66" data-timestamp="3012.66">Sure he is. But the owners of the company only have the rights that they have, the rights the law gives them. It doesn't give them more than that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:50:22.17" data-timestamp="3022.17">Since P&amp;F wouldn't release that study, we asked a company that analyzes CEO compensation to take a look. The company is called Equilar. They do a lot of work for companies who are trying to figure out how much to pay their CEOs.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jacob Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:50:33.60" data-timestamp="3033.6">Here is what Equilar found. Among roughly 200 companies of similar size, Richard Horowitz's pay ranked near the very top, in the top 7%, more than twice the average. Equilar also looked at a smaller group of companies that, like P&amp;F, are in what's called the "industrial goods" sector. There were 13 companies in that group. The top paid CEO was Richard Horowitz.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:50:56.70" data-timestamp="3056.7">In other words, according to the study, Richard Horowitz is one of the highest paid or the highest paid CEO for what he does.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jacob Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:51:10.05" data-timestamp="3070.05">Tim Stabosz lost. But he had owned shares in P&amp;F for most of his adult life. And when you've been in something that long, it can be hard to know when to walk away.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:51:19.65" data-timestamp="3079.65">What happens next? Are you going to keep at this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tim Stabosz</h4><p begin="00:51:22.42" data-timestamp="3082.42">That's a good question. I hadn't thought about that. Um, yeah, yeah. I want the company to know that I'm not going anywhere.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:51:35.45" data-timestamp="3095.45">Do you ever think about giving up?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tim Stabosz</h4><p begin="00:51:39.56" data-timestamp="3099.56">Um, no.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:51:42.16" data-timestamp="3102.16">Really?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tim Stabosz</h4><p begin="00:51:42.55" data-timestamp="3102.55">Well, I mean, I'm trying to think about what giving up means.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:51:45.52" data-timestamp="3105.52">I can tell you what giving up looks like. After we talked to Tim this summer, he had a momentary cash crunch. He had to sell all his shares. The company bought them from him. And as part of the deal, Tim promised not to buy any shares of P&amp;F Industries for three years.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jacob Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:52:00.16" data-timestamp="3120.16">It turns out it's really hard to cut a CEO's pay, even if you own 5% of the company. Now, he has even less power to do anything about it. Now, Tim Stabosz is just like everybody else.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:22.23" data-timestamp="3142.23">Jacob Goldstein and David Kestenbaum from the NPR podcast "Planet Money," the very entertaining podcast about economics.
