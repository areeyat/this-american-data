    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.57" data-timestamp="0.57"> A quick warning-- there are curse words that are unbeeped in today's episode of the show. If you prefer a beeped version, you can find that at our website, thisamericanlife.org.</p><p begin="00:00:11.63" data-timestamp="11.63">We're all getting kind of old in my family. And when we get together for the holidays, there's never any drama anymore. Used to be. I avoided coming home for years all through my 20s and early 30s because my parents and I were not getting along so well. Part of the problem was me. In my early 20s, I was harsh and judgey and said lots of things that now I wouldn't have said and have apologized for.</p><p begin="00:00:34.39" data-timestamp="34.39">But part of the problem was them. They did not agree with most of my big life choices, starting with and especially the fact that I worked in public radio. During that period, I was working for the NPR news shows, <i>All</i> <i>Things</i> <i>Considered</i> and <i>Morning</i> <i>Edition.</i> And my parents were completely against it. I've said this before-- and my parents hate it when I say this-- but my parents are the only Jews in America who don't like public radio.</p><p begin="00:00:55.77" data-timestamp="55.77">The stories are too long. It seemed second rate to them. If I wanted to be a journalist, why wasn't I on TV? Why was I settling for this place that paid me so little? The money was a huge thing. My dad is an accountant, does all our taxes, and so he knew what I made and couldn't quite believe it. I could still earn a good living somewhere. I could still be a doctor.</p><p begin="00:01:15.25" data-timestamp="75.25">So coming home for the holidays, sometimes my dad would pull me aside. Sometimes he would bring it up during dinner at a crowded table. Shouldn't I quit these jobs I love and finally go to med school? It's not too late, my parents pleaded with me well into my 30s. My mom officially, kind of half joking, half serious, gave up the effort when I was 41 and had been hosting <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i> for five years.</p><p begin="00:01:37.86" data-timestamp="97.86">But for so long, my dad especially would express his love and concern for me when I came home by questioning the basics-- where I lived, how I lived, how I dressed, how my hair looked, who I fell in love with, why wasn't I more of a success. To be clear, he wasn't mean. He wasn't angry. He was just very, very concerned.</p><p begin="00:01:59.19" data-timestamp="119.19">My sisters, Randi and Karen, they got their own versions of this. So holidays, yeah, things would get very tense. Which is to say, we were a normal family. But now, it couldn't be more different. My mom died over a decade ago. My dad's in his 80s. In the last couple years, he's had a lot of hearing loss. It's harder to interact with him. He is not the critical, questioning man he once was.</p><p begin="00:02:26.51" data-timestamp="146.51">I go home now, and nothing's bothering him about me that he needs to get off his chest. He's been trained over the years to say I love you when we talk on the phone or see each other. And he actually seems to mean it. He's lovely. But I am not used to this milder, gentler version of the overworked, stressed out dad that I grew up with. It's like that guy-- I don't know-- dissolved away that whole side of his personality, leaving another man standing there.</p><p begin="00:02:53.26" data-timestamp="173.26">And I have to say-- this is bad to admit-- sometimes I miss that other guy. I go home for the holidays, and it's chill and everybody gets along. And I never thought I'd say this-- I swear I never thought these words would come out of my mouth-- I wish he would pick a fight with me. I feel like that's my real dad.</p><p begin="00:03:09.24" data-timestamp="189.24">This elderly guy with the same name, who likes and accepts the person that I'm in love with and, in fact, notices if she leaves her glasses in the dining room and then helpfully brings them to her in the kitchen just to be nice, that guy, he's awesome. But where's my real dad? And this BS of going home for the holidays and not having anything to fight about at all, I mean, are our lives over? Are we already dead? That's it? We're done? No fighting? Are we really a family anymore?</p><p begin="00:03:36.87" data-timestamp="216.87">Today, on our program, we have families boisterously, noisily getting into it with each other, kids coming home with important stuff they've been waiting to get off their chests, parents showing up at their grown children's houses with demands that absolutely need to be met, and then let the games begin. For the holidays, it is a family get-together episode of our show, including a song sung at a family event that either is or is not a veiled critique of one family member in particular. From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One: How Do I Say This?</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:21.05" data-timestamp="261.05"> Act One, How Do I Say This? So we begin today with somebody returning to their family in the suburbs out in the far west in Canada, in Calgary, Alberta. And she is returning with a mission, something she needed to discuss in English, though the thing she wanted to discuss was a different language entirely. The person doing this is Scaachi Koul.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Scaachi Koul</h4><p begin="00:04:43.09" data-timestamp="283.09"> Nine months ago, after 28 years of being alive, I finally started taking Hindi classes. My parents are both from India, and they emigrated to Canada long before I was born. They speak a number of languages, including Hindi, and their mother tongue, Kashmiri. But there's no real textbook or organized class or Duolingo program for Kashmiri. Hindi proved to be the easiest one for me to learn.</p><p begin="00:05:07.12" data-timestamp="307.12">I'm not enjoying these lessons. I've said aloud in class several times that I hate it. I hate it because it's hard, harder than I expected. Because for some reason, I thought this language would come naturally. And yet, for two hours every week, I meet my teacher and fellow classmate at a coffee shop in midtown Manhattan and learn how to greet someone, and tell them what I am presently eating, and that the cat is sitting in the big chair. Sometimes the cat is sitting on the little chair. Learning to say that has cost me $1,150 thus far.</p><p begin="00:05:46.19" data-timestamp="346.19">I started these lessons on a whim. I knew for years that I wanted to do it, but I didn't give much thought as to why. I assumed my parents would be happy about it. Not even just happy-- elated. My dad has said to me more than once, you're barely recognizable. When he says it, he means I'm not recognizable to him as the person he wanted me to be, the person who would never, for example, have married a white man much older than she is, or refused a career in medicine, or smoked at least 800 cigarettes.</p><p begin="00:06:19.83" data-timestamp="379.83">But I don't know if my learning Hindi even matters to my parents, or how much. I also don't know why they never made me learn it in the first place. So I went home to find out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:06:29.98" data-timestamp="389.98"> Hey, Google.

The insults my parents use are the part of their language I absolutely know. I can help you call someone lazy, dumb, loud, annoying, rude, ugly. But the one I know best is [KASHMIRI]. You say it when you're mad or shocked or when someone's cooking is so excellent, you just can't help but want them to get hit by lightning. My dad eventually gives up on trying to teach the Google Home Kashmiri and settles on something she knows.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:08:12.94" data-timestamp="492.94"> Hey, Google.

And she's cooked her usual dinner party spread-- the mallu, rogan josh, bhatta, haakh dripping in oil.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Scaachi Koul</h4><p begin="00:08:59.49" data-timestamp="539.49"> Happy birthday.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brother</h4><p begin="00:09:02.16" data-timestamp="542.16"> Thank you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Scaachi Koul</h4><p begin="00:09:03.99" data-timestamp="543.99"> I have all these questions for my parents. But first, I want to talk to my brother, the only other person in the world who understands what I'm getting myself into. I call my brother 'Bhai,' meaning older brother. He's 12 years older than me and was born in India. Kashmiri is his first language, and though he understands it when it's spoken to him, he lost the ability to speak it himself soon after he moved to Canada as a toddler. He doesn't remember anyone trying to get him to speak Kashmiri instead of English.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brother</h4><p begin="00:09:33.45" data-timestamp="573.45"> But nobody said anything to me, or maybe they did, and I just said, I just want to watch <i>Three's</i> <i>Company.</i> Thank you very much.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Scaachi Koul</h4><p begin="00:09:39.72" data-timestamp="579.72"> That is how my brother learned English-- reruns of <i>Three's</i> <i>Company.</i> Consequently, he has a very complex understanding of tenant protection rights. My brother affirms one thing I remember to be true when we were kids. It was deeply uncool to speak Hindi or Kashmiri. We knew lots of Indian kids who spoke their parents' language. They were dutiful, good, polite, always saying, yes, Auntie [INAUDIBLE]. But we also knew that those kids were fucking dorks and worthy of our ire. We were never dutiful.</p><p begin="00:10:12.20" data-timestamp="612.2">Back then, I envied my brother. He's fair-skinned with angular features and a phonetic name. He could always hide in plain sight. I used to wish I could do the same.</p><p begin="00:10:22.67" data-timestamp="622.67">My brother is married. He lives 20 minutes away from my parents. And he has a nine-year-old daughter that I call Raisin. She is the best person in the world. Raisin is biracial. Her mother is white, and she's light skinned with bright blue eyes. She doesn't speak Hindi or Kashmiri, with the exception of naming her favorite foods. And even though my brother could do something about her slim language skills, he hasn't.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Scaachi Koul</h4><p begin="00:10:47.24" data-timestamp="647.24"> Why haven't you put her in those classes?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brother</h4><p begin="00:10:49.32" data-timestamp="649.32"> She doesn't want to do it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Scaachi Koul</h4><p begin="00:10:51.62" data-timestamp="651.62"> Yeah, but she's nine. She doesn't want to do anything. I don't think she wants to wash her butt. Like--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brother</h4><p begin="00:10:55.51" data-timestamp="655.51"> But I don't want to-- I also don't-- I'm super lazy. So if it's like the reality is driving to the [INAUDIBLE] at 8:30 on a Sunday, that's not going to happen. I can barely get her to go to karate, something she is interested in.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Scaachi Koul</h4><p begin="00:11:08.57" data-timestamp="668.57"> As for my brother, he's not likely to sign up for a class himself, despite having the urge, just like I do.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brother</h4><p begin="00:11:14.69" data-timestamp="674.69"> Do I think about practicing? Yeah, all the time. But I just don't.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Scaachi Koul</h4><p begin="00:11:21.49" data-timestamp="681.49"> (LAUGHING) Why not?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brother</h4><p begin="00:11:23.48" data-timestamp="683.48"> I don't because our parents are merciless when you try to learn something new, and I'm not interested in giving them more fodder for jokes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Scaachi Koul</h4><p begin="00:11:31.37" data-timestamp="691.37"> What do you mean that they're merciless about--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brother</h4><p begin="00:11:33.59" data-timestamp="693.59"> Have you ever tried to speak a language that they know in front of them?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Scaachi Koul</h4><p begin="00:11:39.48" data-timestamp="699.48"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brother</h4><p begin="00:11:39.65" data-timestamp="699.65"> Yeah, how'd that go?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Scaachi Koul</h4><p begin="00:11:42.10" data-timestamp="702.1"> Um--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brother</h4><p begin="00:11:42.96" data-timestamp="702.96"> Yeah, exactly.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Scaachi Koul</h4><p begin="00:11:44.35" data-timestamp="704.35"> I'd say it's a spicy experience.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brother</h4><p begin="00:11:47.23" data-timestamp="707.23"> That doesn't mean anything to me, but OK.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Scaachi Koul</h4><p begin="00:11:49.78" data-timestamp="709.78"> Do you think that we turned out the way he wanted, that he'd-- like when he--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brother</h4><p begin="00:11:53.03" data-timestamp="713.03"> No. No, I don't think we did, at all.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Scaachi Koul</h4><p begin="00:11:58.69" data-timestamp="718.69"> If we didn't turn out the way our dad wanted us to, well, my dad bears a lot of responsibility for that. For one thing, instead of forcing us to learn Hindi, he made us learn French.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Scaachi Koul</h4><p begin="00:12:09.19" data-timestamp="729.19"> Why instead of making me take Hindi classes at the temple, did you decide, oh, I know, I'm going to put them in French immersion for some reason?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:12:19.69" data-timestamp="739.69"> Because Canada is a bilingual country. And I was hoping that the Hindi would come automatically because at home and other Indians.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Scaachi Koul</h4><p begin="00:12:35.62" data-timestamp="755.62"> My dad is loquacious and wry and thinks he's the smartest person in the room. He's also stubborn as hell, and so am I, which means we're often trying to murder each other. After I first got together with the man who would become my husband, the way older white guy, my dad didn't talk to me for a year. When I first asked him how he feels about me taking these classes, he's his typical self-- dismissive and glib.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Scaachi Koul</h4><p begin="00:13:00.34" data-timestamp="780.34"> What did you think when I started taking the Hindi classes?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:13:02.98" data-timestamp="782.98"> I was amused. Since you do whatever you want to do, I thought maybe, OK, good.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Scaachi Koul</h4><p begin="00:13:10.39" data-timestamp="790.39"> What does that mean, I do whatever I want to do?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:13:12.43" data-timestamp="792.43"> Because you are a very independent-minded person. You do not take any instruction or anything. So I was glad that at least you are doing something for your betterment. Because, like I said, having knowledge of another language can never hurt you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Scaachi Koul</h4><p begin="00:13:37.26" data-timestamp="817.26"> Don't be fooled by his detached attitude about whether I speak Hindi. He has other feelings as well, depending on the day. He used to get upset about it. When I was younger, sometimes he would speak to me in Kashmiri and quickly get frustrated that I could barely understand it and couldn't respond. He gave that up after I moved out.</p><p begin="00:13:57.75" data-timestamp="837.75">But ever since I started my Hindi classes, he's trying again. Now when I call my mother, he'll barge into our calls and demand that she speak to me in Hindi and Kashmiri. I had to ask him the same question over and over again before he finally admits that, yes, he's absolutely thrilled at the idea of me learning Hindi.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:14:17.40" data-timestamp="857.4"> And hopefully, one day, you will converse with somebody in Hindi. And you should go to India. I'll go with you, but let you lead so that you can speak with taxi drivers or auto rickshaw drivers or shopkeepers, and try to haggle with them in Hindi. I bet you it'll be hilarious. It'll be wonderful.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Scaachi Koul</h4><p begin="00:14:49.93" data-timestamp="889.93"> Were you surprised that I started taking lessons?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:14:54.08" data-timestamp="894.08"> Yeah, I was. Because you were-- both you kids were extremely whitewashed. Maybe I had something to do with it. I didn't purposely do that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Scaachi Koul</h4><p begin="00:15:11.89" data-timestamp="911.89"> Exactly what my dad had to do with that goes all the way back to his arrival in Canada. This is who my dad was when me and my brother were kids-- 125 pounds, 5 foot 4, ambitious, and working hard as a pharmaceutical representative. It was all so we would eventually have all you could ever want-- house, two cars, a yard, university educations. We were middle class in Canada, all with traditional Hindu names. It was the Indian dream.</p><p begin="00:15:43.81" data-timestamp="943.81">We didn't have much family near us in Calgary. I didn't go to school with any other brown kids until I was well into high school. My brother and cousin spoke to each other and me in English. My father had this idea that we'd pick up Hindi at home, but that's ridiculous. My parents spoke Kashmiri and English. Hindi was reserved for Bollywood movies and when my mom needed to speak to her jeweler. What form of osmosis is my dad even talking about?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:16:09.97" data-timestamp="969.97"> I thought that this language, mother tongue specifically, would come a little later on. And I should concentrate on you being totally assimilated with the Canadian culture, if you will, whatever that culture is. But somehow I should have created some sort of infrastructure where you would be-- you would learn and be at least proficient in one of the languages-- Indian languages, that is.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Scaachi Koul</h4><p begin="00:16:52.09" data-timestamp="1012.09"> Well, why didn't you make me take lessons for either Hindi or Kashmiri?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:16:58.36" data-timestamp="1018.36"> I don't know. I don't know why. I ought to have done it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Scaachi Koul</h4><p begin="00:17:12.88" data-timestamp="1032.88"> I don't think my dad is equipped to directly talk about how hard it was to leave India. My mom can talk about her sadness easily, as if all those feelings are still right at the surface of her skin, waiting to bleed out of her and drown me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:17:27.24" data-timestamp="1047.24"> I had to say goodbye to my dad and my mother. That was very hard. That was really, really hard.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Scaachi Koul</h4><p begin="00:17:37.35" data-timestamp="1057.35"> My dad was the family's sole breadwinner, and in her early days in Canada, my mother was alone a lot with my brother, just a toddler.

I was maybe five then. She says that I'd wander out of class, which was held in the basement of our [INAUDIBLE], and would trot up the stairs to find her. I don't remember this at all. They stopped trying to force it. At the time, I'm sure I was thrilled that they left it alone.</p><p begin="00:19:22.93" data-timestamp="1162.93">I pushed against brownness in every way I could. I recoiled when my white friends would call and overhear my parents speaking Kashmiri in the background. I didn't want to invite them over because they could smell sandalwood in the curtains.

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:26:46.77" data-timestamp="1606.77"> It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Each week on the program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's show, "Too Close to Home." For the holidays, stories of family get-togethers where somebody shows up with something they think the entire family has to deal with, or at least, discuss. And they're ready to force the issue. We've arrived at Act Two of our program. Act Two, You Probably Think This Song is About You.</p><p begin="00:27:09.86" data-timestamp="1629.86">So in this act, two family members show up with a message. The message is contained in a song, which makes sense because the family includes a bunch of musicians. The dad in this family is Loudon Wainwright III, the songwriter who started putting out albums in the 1970s. He is father to singer-songwriters Rufus Wainwright and Martha Wainwright, and with a different mom, Lucy Wainwright Roche. Lucy's mom is Suzzy Roche, who got some notoriety in the band The Roches. Lucy and Suzzy came into the studio to tell the story of this song.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy Wainwright Roche</h4><p begin="00:27:39.84" data-timestamp="1659.84"> We sang this one, actually, at one of my dad's weddings.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:27:44.03" data-timestamp="1664.03"> To be precise, her dad, Loudon, had gotten married for the second time. And this was a party to celebrate it, maybe 50 people. Lucy went with her mom, Suzzy, who'd never been married to Loudon, but they were together for years.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy Wainwright Roche</h4><p begin="00:27:55.91" data-timestamp="1675.91"> And he asked us if we wanted to sing something, and we said, sure. And then he was like, OK, well, pick whatever you feel like singing and surprise us. And we'd been learning this song that was a cover song that we just really liked. And sometimes when you're learning a new song, you kind of have a little crush on the song, so you just want to sing it all the time. And so we were like, let's just do that new one that we've been learning. And we just didn't really think it through.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Suzzy Roche</h4><p begin="00:28:24.59" data-timestamp="1704.59"> Yeah, I would say that that's an understatement. I don't know what we were thinking. I mean, it was one of those kind of situations where you're standing in front of a roomful of people, and they all have their champagne glasses. And they're looking at you, smiling. And you start to sing the song. And so just imagine that you're at a wedding, and--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy Wainwright Roche</h4><p begin="00:28:45.41" data-timestamp="1725.41"> Yeah, you're--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Suzzy Roche</h4><p begin="00:28:45.70" data-timestamp="1725.7"> --these people are going to sing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy Wainwright Roche</h4><p begin="00:28:47.15" data-timestamp="1727.15"> You got your champagne, and then this happens.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:28:51.20" data-timestamp="1731.2"> All right.

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:37:26.26" data-timestamp="2246.26"> Music from Loudon Wainwright III, which brings us to Act Three of our show. Act Three, Pigeons on a Plane. So we have one more family member on a mission for you today, and this mission was made possible by a government official, a government official in Mexico, namely the Secretary of Migration in the Mexican state of Michoacán. And a little while back, this official, he started to hear that lots of elderly people in Mexico were dying without being able to see their kids. Because their kids were living in the United States and were undocumented. And the kids didn't have the papers to cross in and out of Mexico.</p><p begin="00:38:00.23" data-timestamp="2280.23">The migration secretary wanted to help, and he set up a program to help these elderly Mexicans with families in the US get tourist visas. They have special days at the US embassy for them to apply, buses to take them to the embassy. And then they organized these trips, these trips were they fly them to the United States en masse. These elderly people get regular tourist visas with the same rules as any other tourist visas, but good for 10 years so that they can come and go and see their kids and grandkids in the US. You have to be 60 years old qualify for the program.</p><p begin="00:38:32.04" data-timestamp="2312.04">And since 2017, over 9,000 people have come to the States this way. Not one of them, we're told, has ever overstayed a visa. Over a dozen other Mexican states have created their own versions of the program. In Michoacán, the elderly travelers are known as palomas mensajeras, the messenger pigeons. Reporter Kevin Sieff tagged along on one of their trips. He started in Mexico and flew to the US with them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:38:59.71" data-timestamp="2339.71"> I'm standing with a group of 70 elderly palomas mensajeras. They're all wearing matching T-shirts and have lanyards around their necks with these big clear pouches, holding their airport tickets and passports. It looks like a giant group of really old schoolchildren. To make sure no one's wandered off, the chaperones take a roll call.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chaperone</h4><p begin="00:39:17.59" data-timestamp="2357.59"> [READING NAMES]</p><p begin="00:39:18.89" data-timestamp="2358.89"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:39:27.23" data-timestamp="2367.23"> We're at a small airport in central Mexico. The people in this group have some very specific things in common. None of them has ever flown on an airplane before, and they're all headed to Chicago to see their kids for the first time in more than a decade.</p><p begin="00:39:43.16" data-timestamp="2383.16">The biggest migration boom from Mexico happened in the 1990s, nearly 5 million people by the end of the decade. The exodus was especially big in a city called Ciudad Hidalgo, where these parents are from. By 1998, roughly 10% of the city's population was living in Chicago. Today, the kids who cross the border as teenagers and 20 somethings are middle-aged undocumented immigrants with children of their own, US citizen children who've never met their grandparents.</p><p begin="00:40:14.47" data-timestamp="2414.47">Those are the grandparents I'm with now. They board the plane slowly, so slowly, as you'd expect on a flight where almost everyone is elderly, on canes and wheelchairs, and utterly unaccustomed to air travel.</p><p begin="00:40:26.26" data-timestamp="2426.26">Sort of chaotic now as everyone's boarding, a lot of confusion about where people are sitting. This woman's asking, am I in the right seat? Is this the right seat? She's actually in the wrong seat.</p><p begin="00:40:41.01" data-timestamp="2441.01">The parent I ended up talking to the most was a mom named Lupita Neri. At 67, she was one of the younger parents on the trip. She sat in the front of the plane in a window seat, wearing a yellow dress and heels and bright pink lipstick.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lupita Neri</h4><p begin="00:40:54.10" data-timestamp="2454.1"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p><p begin="00:40:55.25" data-timestamp="2455.25"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:41:02.50" data-timestamp="2462.5"> She's saying she expected the plane to move like a truck, but it didn't.

And I tell him, well, from your perspective, you're seeing it as something that's so impossible. But it's not.</p><p begin="00:43:06.14" data-timestamp="2586.14">Save up some money over there so that you can come back here without needing to go back to the United States. And yes, maybe we'll live humbly, and we'll be eating beans and eggs. But you'll at least be here in your home. And my son says, well, I'll think about it, Mom. I'll think about it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:43:24.20" data-timestamp="2604.2"> Like a lot of the parents I talked to, Lupita never expected Daniel and Marilu to be gone for so long, at most just a few years. Save some money, and then come back to Mexico. That was their original plan. Daniel even bought a calendar and penciled in the date when he would return.</p><p begin="00:43:39.59" data-timestamp="2619.59">But they kept pushing back the deadline, telling her they needed to save more money. Then they had children and houses and dogs and friends. It got harder to leave. Lupita was losing her patience. She'd been living alone since her husband died four years ago of cancer. She wanted her kids with her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lupita Neri</h4><p begin="00:43:56.17" data-timestamp="2636.17"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p><p begin="00:43:57.34" data-timestamp="2637.34"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:43:58.70" data-timestamp="2638.7"> Both of them have told me, Mom, just give me time.

And I say, but I've already given you a lot of time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:44:06.10" data-timestamp="2646.1"> Lupita had another son, Isaac, who moved to the US and died of pneumonia a few years ago. She never had the chance to say goodbye, even over the phone. It made her feel like that could be her, dying without them. She wanted the kids back now.</p><p begin="00:44:23.63" data-timestamp="2663.63">Daniel was the first to leave Mexico, back in 1999. He got a job as a dishwasher and then kept working his way up to bartending at fancy restaurants. Marilu joined Daniel in Chicago soon after. She was a single mom with five kids who needed more money for her family. She took cleaning jobs in Chicago. Now she works three jobs, including back-to-back night shifts, cleaning at a restaurant and a health clinic.</p><p begin="00:44:48.35" data-timestamp="2688.35">Lupita says when she's brought up coming home on the phone, she's been pretty gentle. She thinks in person, it'll all be different. She'll be more aggressive, and her kids will really have to hear her out. Her plan was to wait until she'd been in Chicago for about a week before springing this conversation on them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lupita Neri</h4><p begin="00:45:05.44" data-timestamp="2705.44"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:45:07.82" data-timestamp="2707.82"> So you got to just wait till everything is calm. Because if I do it immediately, then it'll be like dumping a bucket of cold water on their heads, and that might scare them off. So I'm going to wait for a day when my son takes me out to go sightseeing. And that's when I'll talk to him. We'll maybe go out to have a coffee, maybe eat a hamburger. And then I'll start talking to him about it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:45:33.14" data-timestamp="2733.14"> And Lupita kept making what sounded like a half joke, half backup plan about her son Daniel.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:45:40.97" data-timestamp="2740.97"> I think sometimes it would be so great if they could actually deport him back to be with me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:45:48.59" data-timestamp="2748.59"> I asked Lupita what her kids would think if they knew she was saying that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:45:53.41" data-timestamp="2753.41"> Well, I think they'll get mad.

The chaperones had specifically told them not to come to the airport. It wasn't a good idea to have so many undocumented people in a place with so much law enforcement. The organizers tried to keep details about the reunion secret. There's the sinking worry that ICE could find out. Some families worried that the whole thing could be a ploy to deport them.</p><p begin="00:47:15.22" data-timestamp="2835.22">In the church basement, about 300 people, all families, squished together, long folding tables piled with flowers, homemade posters, and heart-shaped balloons. There are grown men walking around with teddy bears for their moms. Then an MC standing near the door started giving updates about the parents landing at the airport, getting on buses headed to the church. The mood got rowdier.</p><p begin="00:47:38.31" data-timestamp="2858.31">[CHEERING]</p><p begin="00:47:42.19" data-timestamp="2862.19"></p><p begin="00:47:45.12" data-timestamp="2865.12">Lupita's son Daniel and her daughter, Marilu, are sitting at a table near the center of the room. They crane their necks to watch for the bus. Marilu has been waiting in the church basement for hours. She left three children in Mexico when she came to Chicago, and she brought two younger kids with her. It gnaws at her not seeing her kids back in Mexico. And she worries about her mom dying alone.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marilu</h4><p begin="00:48:07.98" data-timestamp="2887.98"> I feel sad. She's by herself. I worry about her.

I called Lupita after the trip to find out what happened.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:53:27.04" data-timestamp="3207.04"> Did you stick to your plan about how you were going to ask and how many times you were going to ask?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lupita Neri</h4><p begin="00:53:32.33" data-timestamp="3212.33"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:53:34.72" data-timestamp="3214.72"> Well, I planned it out, and I did it, but well, it didn't work.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:53:40.09" data-timestamp="3220.09"> How many times did you try?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:53:43.45" data-timestamp="3223.45"> Oh, heaven, almost every other day, I'd say something to them.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:53:46.89" data-timestamp="3226.89"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lupita Neri</h4><p begin="00:53:48.18" data-timestamp="3228.18"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:53:50.35" data-timestamp="3230.35"> Every other day.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:53:51.28" data-timestamp="3231.28"> Every third day.</p><p begin="00:53:52.87" data-timestamp="3232.87">[SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:53:54.07" data-timestamp="3234.07"> Yes, every other day, so that I wouldn't bother them.
