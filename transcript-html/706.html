  <h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:12.08" data-timestamp="12.08"> It started as something that she was doing in her spare time and kind of took over her life. Lissa Yellow Bird searches for missing people, people nobody else is looking for, people the police have given up looking for. A reporter, Sierra Crane Murdoch, met Lissa in 2014 when Sierra was looking into the disappearance of a young, white oil worker, KC Clarke. He'd vanished a couple years before on the reservation Lissa's from in North Dakota. Lissa was investigating it too.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:00:38.72" data-timestamp="38.72"> She had just gotten out of prison. She was looking for a distraction, a way to stay sober. And she basically opened up her files to me and allowed me to see the degree to which she had involved herself in this case.</p><p begin="00:00:55.82" data-timestamp="55.82">She had actually spent years. And she cracked that case through really, really non-traditional means, like by basically waging this campaign against the person who she believed had murdered KC Clarke. She mailed tens and tens of thousands of fliers around western North Dakota.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:20.84" data-timestamp="80.84"> The flyer said, "Beware", with a photo of the guy she thought murdered KC Clarke and his wife. And they did turn people against him. But at the same time, Lissa befriended the wife.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:01:30.98" data-timestamp="90.98"> They were texting each other almost every day. They were talking on the phone constantly. And so she had this really intimate window into the lives of these people she was trying to investigate.</p><p begin="00:01:43.46" data-timestamp="103.46">And through that window, she was able to see their vulnerabilities. So at the same time that she was maintaining this faux friendship with this woman, she was also completely undermining her and her husband. And the case broke open.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:57.32" data-timestamp="117.32"> Sierra spent years with Lissa, watching this play out, and ended up writing a book about Lissa and the case. They got close. Sierra would stay at Lissa's apartment for months. They'd drive through the badlands, running down leads, talked for hours every week when Sierra wasn't in North Dakota.</p><p begin="00:02:12.57" data-timestamp="132.57">And during those years, this thing happened. Native American families started asking Lissa to look for their loved ones. Lissa's Arikara, a member of the Mandan Hidatsa Arikara Nation. Remember, Lissa was just kind of inventing how she did this work. Before this, she'd been a welder, a prison guard, a social worker, did some law enforcement work and studied criminal justice in college, but she'd also been a drug dealer.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:02:35.28" data-timestamp="155.28"> Lissa has lived on both sides of the law, which is what makes her so good at what she does. She's gone to prison. She knows how law enforcement operates from a perpetrator's point of view as well.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:48.23" data-timestamp="168.23"> In dozens of cases now, sometimes on her own, sometimes with law enforcement. Lissa has deployed the same doggedness and resourcefulness that she marshaled in that first case. Like, for example, when a woman named Olivia Lone Bear went missing from Lissa's reservation in 2017, there was this national search for her. But Lissa's theory was she might not be far from home, where she was last seen. And one day, she decided to take a boat out on the lake near Olivia's house with some fishing sonar that she'd bought years earlier thinking someday it might come in handy to find missing people.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:03:17.48" data-timestamp="197.48"> She just launched the boat. And yeah, within about 10 minutes, her younger relative spotted some shape on the fishing sonar and said, hey, Auntie, what's that? And Lissa looked at it, and it was a truck. And Olivia was inside.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:38.75" data-timestamp="218.75"> Months before this, Lissa and Olivia's family had tried to convince law enforcement authorities to look in that lake.</p><p begin="00:03:51.63" data-timestamp="231.63">Lots of Native Americans go missing and are never found. We don't even have good statistics on this, because the cases are so underreported and poorly tracked. A big part of the problem? There are these federal laws that limit who can investigate cases and how they can investigate them on reservations, which leads to a jurisdictional tangle. And it's often not clear which law enforcement agency is supposed to take a case.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:04:13.70" data-timestamp="253.7"> If you don't know if they disappeared from on a reservation or off a reservation, it's really hard to say whose responsibility that case is.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:21.62" data-timestamp="261.62"> On the reservation, tribal police or the federal authorities. Off the reservation, city, or county, or state police.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:04:28.70" data-timestamp="268.7"> But because it's so unclear, those cases can become a lot lower priority, or those cases can be ignored by all jurisdictions. And that's where Lissa Yellow Bird comes in. She searches for the people who slip through these jurisdictional cracks.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:49.31" data-timestamp="289.31"> So what's the story you're about to tell?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:04:51.80" data-timestamp="291.8"> So in 2016, Lissa's own niece went missing. And this was the first time that she went searching for someone who wasn't a stranger. She just never expected that it would happen to her own relative.</p><p begin="00:05:07.13" data-timestamp="307.13">But this case is really remarkable for a lot of reasons. For one, she figured it out in just five days. She also recorded all of her conversations, which is something that Lissa does a lot. She saves everything. She photographs everything. She records everything.</p><p begin="00:05:24.92" data-timestamp="324.92">And Lissa gave me these phone calls that she'd recorded over the course of these five days. And they were just incredible because they really showed how she was able to break this case open in a minute-by-minute way.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:42.71" data-timestamp="342.71"> Sierra says another thing about this case-- she and Lissa talked for hours all the time about everything. But after those five days when Lissa was working this case--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:05:51.71" data-timestamp="351.71"> She just kind of went quiet about it. We didn't talk about it for years, which is really unusual because Lissa is always talking about her cases. She just never talked about this case again, though. And I knew that-- I knew because she was so quiet about it, and I knew also because it was her own relative that it had affected her in a way that no other case had.</p><p begin="00:06:19.00" data-timestamp="379">But I didn't really know why, entirely. I thought there was something else going on. And three years passed, and that was when she finally said, OK, yeah, I'm ready to talk about it. She wanted to talk about it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:33.01" data-timestamp="393.01"> Sierra suggested doing a story, and Lissa said yes. She wanted people to hear it. And that is what we're bringing you today. We listen in on this exceptional investigator, Lissa Yellow Bird. Those phone calls, they are really amazing. She just knows how to read people and how to pull information out of them that other people cannot get. And we hear her crack this case in five very intense days.</p><p begin="00:06:56.46" data-timestamp="416.46">From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. And before we get to this story, a heads up. This story mentions violence, including sexual violence. Here's Sierra Crane Murdoch.</p></div>  </div>
</div>
<div class="act" id="act1">
  <h3>Act One: Act One</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:07:07.80" data-timestamp="427.8"> The last time I saw Lissa, we were at her grandma's house on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. This was in February. Her mom had called her over to find their missing cat, not something Lissa usually searches for, but she drove over right away in her hot pink pajamas.</p><p begin="00:07:24.45" data-timestamp="444.45">And while everyone's eating breakfast, Lissa walks to the window, stares out with binoculars. Lissa thinks some coyotes got the cat. A few days earlier, her mom bought a hunting rifle, and everyone's cracking up at the idea of Lissa's mom, a retired professor who doesn't like to be outside and who's never had a gun, taking to the porch with her rifle. Lissa asks her nephew, Mercury, to teach her mom how to use it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:07:49.18" data-timestamp="469.18"> Yeah, it's a scary situation, Mercury. We need your help.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:07:52.62" data-timestamp="472.62"> Lissa goes to the bedroom to get the rifle. She comes back holding a guitar case and hands it to Mercury.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mercury White</h4><p begin="00:07:59.55" data-timestamp="479.55"> This is perfect.</p><p begin="00:08:00.85" data-timestamp="480.85">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:08:02.75" data-timestamp="482.75"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:08:03.70" data-timestamp="483.7"> I wasn't even paying attention. It's like, oh. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mercury White</h4><p begin="00:08:08.13" data-timestamp="488.13"> I picked it up by the neck, and I thought it was a barrel and stuff. It was a Fender guitar.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:08:13.44" data-timestamp="493.44"> Sing some songs to those coyotes. [LAUGHS] Ooh-- you'll be out there with the chair, just singing away.</p><p begin="00:08:20.87" data-timestamp="500.87">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:08:22.48" data-timestamp="502.48"></p><p begin="00:08:25.04" data-timestamp="505.04">My bad. OK, everybody got the laugh of the day.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:08:29.07" data-timestamp="509.07"> The Yellow Birds are really close. At any time, you'll find four generations of them just hanging out at Lissa's grandma's house for days on end. And it was at this house-- everyone eating, laughing, watching television-- where they last saw Lissa's niece, Carla Yellow Bird, before she went missing. That was in August of 2016.</p><p begin="00:08:49.85" data-timestamp="529.85">At first, they weren't that worried. Carla didn't live with the Yellow Birds. She lived about two hours away off the reservation, but she was always stopping by, sometimes stayed the night. She was 27, had lots of energy, confident. She'd walk into her family's house, plug her iPhone into their speakers, and start jamming hip hop.</p><p begin="00:09:09.45" data-timestamp="549.45">And it wasn't unusual for Carla to take off for a few days, not answer when they called. When she stopped coming around, her family told Lissa, don't worry.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:09:18.39" data-timestamp="558.39"> We were like, oh, she's just out doing her thing, or she's probably doing something she shouldn't be. So, she'll come out.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:09:25.97" data-timestamp="565.97"> Lissa was starting to worry though. Carla was the daughter of one of Lissa's favorite relatives, Uncle Chucky. He died a few years earlier. One of the last things he'd asked Lissa was to look out for Carla.</p><p begin="00:09:38.45" data-timestamp="578.45">Then one morning, Lissa had a dream about Chucky. It wasn't long. He just kind of appeared, and he said, you need to go get Carla now. Lissa called her family and found out the night before they'd asked a holy woman to come to the house and pray for Carla. They hadn't wanted to tell Lissa.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:09:55.21" data-timestamp="595.21"> And I was like, what do you mean you had a ceremony? So if you guys didn't think anything was wrong, what would you be having a ceremony for? And I said, look, somebody needs to come clean with me and tell me what the hell is really going on.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:10:11.04" data-timestamp="611.04"> Her mom told her they actually were really worried. At this point, no one had heard from Carla in weeks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:10:17.45" data-timestamp="617.45"> And I said, why did you guys lie to me? Well, we didn't lie, we just don't want you to put all this stuff out on social media, and we know that's probably what will happen.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:10:28.61" data-timestamp="628.61"> Lissa's family told her they didn't want it on social media, out of protectiveness for Carla. Carla had been in some legal trouble. She was addicted to meth. They didn't want to make things harder for her. Lissa thought maybe they were also embarrassed. In the Yellow Bird family are professors, anthropologists, social workers, all very aware of the stereotypes used to shame native communities.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:10:51.14" data-timestamp="651.14"> Being drunken, being filthy, being all these labels that they give us that, when something of that nature takes over one of our family members, the last thing we want to admit is that it's hit us. I think what it boils down to is trying to keep a good reputation. So I think that played a major role of shame.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:11:15.76" data-timestamp="675.76"> Lissa's seen this firsthand with how the family treated her. She was addicted to meth, spent three years in prison for dealing. For a while, her family avoided her. Even now, Lissa's been sober 15 years, and they don't like to talk about it. Lissa's mom doesn't even use the word "prison." She calls it "Lissa's other college."</p><p begin="00:11:35.49" data-timestamp="695.49">Lissa couldn't disagree more with this attitude. She believes that when someone goes missing, that's the worst possible time to hide the facts. Often the things someone is trying to cover up can be part of what led them to go missing in the first place.</p><p begin="00:11:49.13" data-timestamp="709.13">Lissa called Carla's mom, Loretta. Loretta lived a few hours away on another reservation, and the Yellow Birds didn't know her very well. Carla's parents weren't together long. Loretta told Lissa she'd reported Carla missing a few weeks earlier. Lissa offered to help find Carla, and Loretta said yes.</p><p begin="00:12:07.88" data-timestamp="727.88">So Lissa got to work. One of the first people she called was the officer responsible for the case, April Jose, a detective for the city of Mandan, where Carla lived. April said she'd learned that in the days before Carla disappeared, Carla was on the Fort Berthold Reservation, and she might have gone to a second reservation, called Spirit Lake. But April didn't have jurisdiction on reservations. She was a city cop.</p><p begin="00:12:32.07" data-timestamp="752.07">This is another part of the jurisdictional tangle in these cases. April was trying to follow every lead, but she could only go so far. To interview suspects on the reservation, she needed the cooperation of law enforcement there. It's part of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. But no one was calling her back.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:12:49.62" data-timestamp="769.62"> She did tell me this spans five states and three reservations. My hands are tied. And I said, mine aren't. I'll go wherever. This is my niece.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:13:00.34" data-timestamp="780.34"> So Lissa did exactly the thing her family didn't want her to do. She opened Facebook and wrote, "Carla Yellow Bird has been missing, and I want to know any and all info related to her disappearance before I take this to the next level." People in the broader native community know Lissa, the work she does. When she puts something on Facebook, people respond, give her leads they might be more cautious about giving police. She started getting calls right away, and she learned Carla was last seen driving around with two men on the Spirit Lake Indian Reservation.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:13:32.21" data-timestamp="812.21"> And they just describe it was an older car. It was smaller. It had two different kinds of paint, maybe a replacement front quarter panel. And it had plastic on one window.</p><p begin="00:13:42.40" data-timestamp="822.4">So when I put that out there, people from Spirit Lake, people from Bismarck were like, hey, we saw that car. We saw these people. We know Carla. That car belongs to Suna Guy's father.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:13:55.23" data-timestamp="835.23"> Suna Guy, she hears this name a few times. He's a member of the Spirit Lake Tribe. So Lissa posts again on Facebook, says her niece was last seen with Suna Guy, gives his full name. And within a few hours, she gets a call from a blocked number.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Suna Guy</h4><p begin="00:14:10.75" data-timestamp="850.75"> Why is my name being put in stuff when I don't even know what's going on?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:14:14.57" data-timestamp="854.57"> OK, that's fine. I appreciate that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:14:17.64" data-timestamp="857.64"> It's Suna.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Suna Guy</h4><p begin="00:14:18.85" data-timestamp="858.85"> I'm not a bad guy, you know what I mean? If there's a way I can help anybody, I try. I mean-- what's your name again? I don't even know your name, but I'm calling you.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:14:29.53" data-timestamp="869.53"> Here, I'll spell it for you, OK?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Suna Guy</h4><p begin="00:14:31.91" data-timestamp="871.91"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:14:32.74" data-timestamp="872.74"> It's L-I-S-S-A.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Suna Guy</h4><p begin="00:14:35.44" data-timestamp="875.44"> Lisa? Lissa?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:14:36.94" data-timestamp="876.94"> Lissa.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Suna Guy</h4><p begin="00:14:38.38" data-timestamp="878.38"> Lissa.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:14:39.33" data-timestamp="879.33"> Say it 16 times, and you won't forget it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Suna Guy</h4><p begin="00:14:42.45" data-timestamp="882.45"> [LAUGHS] Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:14:46.36" data-timestamp="886.36"> So do you have any other insight into what happened to Carla?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Suna Guy</h4><p begin="00:14:50.85" data-timestamp="890.85"> Do I? No, I don't. I'm just trying to clear up the air where-- hey, I made contact with you guys. I'm just letting you guys know only what I know. That's all I know.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:15:05.39" data-timestamp="905.39"> Hmm. Well, your efforts are duly noted.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Suna Guy</h4><p begin="00:15:12.53" data-timestamp="912.53"> Mm-hm.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:15:14.35" data-timestamp="914.35"> There are long stretches where Lissa doesn't say anything, just lets Suna fill the silence. Lissa sounds sort of unimpressed, which is tactical.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:15:23.87" data-timestamp="923.87"> So do you want to give me your phone number? Or do you feel kind of paranoid about that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Suna Guy</h4><p begin="00:15:28.94" data-timestamp="928.94"> Why would I be paranoid? What I'm just saying-- does all that mean--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:15:31.49" data-timestamp="931.49"> Well, I don't know. I'm just saying, you know? I understand where you're coming from.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Suna Guy</h4><p begin="00:15:37.67" data-timestamp="937.67"> You know what? Put it like this. Only certain people have my phone number.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:15:43.90" data-timestamp="943.9"> OK, so you don't want to give it to me then? Is that what you're saying?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Suna Guy</h4><p begin="00:15:47.08" data-timestamp="947.08"> Yeah, because you know what-- [SCOFFS]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:15:49.60" data-timestamp="949.6"> OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Suna Guy</h4><p begin="00:15:49.78" data-timestamp="949.78"> You make me feel like I've got something hiding or something. Maybe I did-- I mean, I feel I'm doing something right by contacting you and letting you know.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:15:56.00" data-timestamp="956"> Well, I'm not-- like I said, I appreciate it. I'm not trying to give you that feeling. I'm not trying to give you that feeling at all.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Suna Guy</h4><p begin="00:16:00.81" data-timestamp="960.81"> You know what I mean?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:16:01.39" data-timestamp="961.39"> What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to find out where my niece is at.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Suna Guy</h4><p begin="00:16:04.81" data-timestamp="964.81"> Yeah, I understand. And like I said I mean, if I knew more than what I only know-- I'm being honest to got truth-- I would give you all the information I do know-- I would know, you know what I mean?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:16:15.71" data-timestamp="975.71"> Lissa spends a lot of this conversation trying to get Suna to give her his number.

Good fucking luck.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:23:30.92" data-timestamp="1410.92"> Carla and Lissa had some things in common. There are obvious things. They both had addictions. They were both mothers. They really loved their kids. But because of their addictions, they'd had their kids taken away from them for stretches of time. They knew how awful that felt.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:23:47.30" data-timestamp="1427.3"> It was a lot for her. I'm sure I wasn't the favorite auntie, because I was worried. I'd say-- if she was doing wrong, I could tell just by the way our first eye contact was. And she'd be like, jeez, auntie, you know? Not every time I'm here is bad.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:24:08.60" data-timestamp="1448.6"> Lissa says Carla was a really cute kid-- kind of shy, giddy. But as Carla got older, Lissa would get on her case. Carla was known to take your stuff, little things. Like if you left your earrings out, you might later see your relative wearing them. And they'd be like, look at the cute earrings Carla gave me. The last time Lissa saw Carla, they were at their grandma's house. Lissa walked in on Carla raiding the fridge.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:24:34.32" data-timestamp="1474.32"> And all of a sudden, I see this big, gaudy, fake diamond ring. I didn't even see her head, because she had it so far in there trying to get some munchies out. It was like this two-karat-- I don't even think it was a cubic zirconia. And I was like, oh, my god.</p><p begin="00:24:53.34" data-timestamp="1493.34">She heard my voice, and her head popped up. And she was like, oh, here she comes to pick on me again. She's like, what, what? And I went over there, and I literally grabbed that fake gem. And I said, let me see this once.</p><p begin="00:25:07.44" data-timestamp="1507.44">And she took it off, and she was like, oh, my god. I thought you were going to start in on me again. [LAUGHS] She was in better condition that day. I said, I am going to start in on you because of this stupid ring.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:25:20.01" data-timestamp="1520.01"> Lissa told her, damn, Carla, if you're going to steal, at least steal something nice. Still, when Carla needed help, she often called Lissa. And Lissa tried to help her as best she could because of Carla's dad, Chucky. He's a big part of why it's taken Lissa so long to talk about Carla and why it still hurts so much.</p><p begin="00:25:42.04" data-timestamp="1542.04">Let me just tell you what happened. A few years before Carla went missing, Chucky moved in with his mom, Lissa's grandma. Lissa would visit him a lot, spend hours in his bedroom. They'd flip through books together and talk about them. Chucky didn't have as many graduate degrees as others in his family, but everyone said he was the smartest Yellow Bird.</p><p begin="00:26:02.68" data-timestamp="1562.68">It made Lissa feel good to keep up with him. She liked proving to herself and to Chucky that she hadn't totally fried her brain with drugs. They spent lots of time debating this massive book he kept by his bed, <i>The</i> <i>Code</i> <i>of</i> <i>Federal</i> <i>Regulations,</i> <i>Title</i> <i>25.</i> It spells out how the US government is supposed to fulfill its obligations to tribes in exchange for taking their land, how it's supposed to always act in their best interest, for their well-being, obligations the government has ignored in all kinds of ways both Lissa and Chucky witnessed themselves.</p><p begin="00:26:36.75" data-timestamp="1596.75">Chucky was four years old during a major event in their tribe. The US government built a dam, flooded out most of the reservation, forced everyone, including the Yellow Birds, to relocate. They were farmers, self-sufficient, but the land the government moved them to was unfarmable. There was huge unemployment. A lot of people left the reservation for cities. Chucky and most of his generation were sent away to boarding schools where a lot of them were abused.</p><p begin="00:27:06.31" data-timestamp="1626.31">In his room, Chucky also had stacks of articles about an emerging science called epigenetics that's shown how traumatic stress can change the way a person's genes behave and how those changes can affect your kids' genes, make it likelier that they develop illnesses, like depression or PTSD. Chucky put into words a pattern Lissa had observed her whole life, that she and the people she would later help had been delivered into a system where they had no chance, a system that kept taking from them, until they died. And their bodies are dragged behind bushes or left to drift at the bottoms of rivers and lakes. And few people bother to look for them, to fish them out.</p><p begin="00:27:47.81" data-timestamp="1667.81">Chucky himself wasn't doing so well. He was an alcoholic. He was in his early 60s, and he had cirrhosis.</p><p begin="00:27:56.05" data-timestamp="1676.05">One night when Chucky was drinking, he got violent, and his mom kicked him out of the house. Lissa called him and told him to come to Fargo where she was living. She didn't think he'd come. But then he called her one night from a Fargo hotel. He wouldn't tell her which one.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:28:12.12" data-timestamp="1692.12"> He was like, I've been drinking. And I know you're in sobriety, I know you're doing well, so I don't want to bring that to your house. And I was like, well, that don't make no sense, because I told you if you want to die by the bottle that's fine with me, but I just want to be near you. I don't want you out on the streets somewhere freezing to death, or any weird stuff going on. So if you could just get your butt over here, that would be great. And he's like, no, I got a room. I'll be good for tonight. And tomorrow, I'll come over.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:28:44.53" data-timestamp="1724.53"> Later that night, Chucky called Lissa again. He said he was going to kill himself. Lissa stayed on the phone with him all night, for seven hours. She kept him on one line. On the other line-- she took her son's phone-- dialed the police. She called every hotel in the city looking for him. Before Lissa could find him, Chucky hung himself. That was the night he asked Lissa to watch out for Carla.</p><p begin="00:29:16.89" data-timestamp="1756.89">In the three days Lissa was getting all these calls from Suna, she was also trying over and over to reach the one investigator who has the authority to look into crimes on the Spirit Lake Indian Reservation, an investigator with the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Lissa left a ton of messages for him, even asked a tribal councilman to call on her behalf. And finally, after days of this, the investigator returned her calls.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:29:42.07" data-timestamp="1782.07"> Hello?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Investigator</h4><p begin="00:29:43.69" data-timestamp="1783.69"> Hello.

It was a two-hour drive, and she called me. We talked the whole time. She told me she felt like all her searching for missing people had prepared her for this moment.</p><p begin="00:46:32.30" data-timestamp="2792.3">When she got to the reservation, FBI agents were already there. Suna had brought them to Carla's body. The crime scene was taped off. It was in a wooded area, the ground marked with old tire tracks. Carla lay no more than 50 yards from the road. People had been driving right past her for weeks.</p><p begin="00:46:51.53" data-timestamp="2811.53">The agents didn't let Lissa get close to Carla. Instead, they brought her pictures to make the identification. Carla was in bad shape. Lissa barely recognized her. And then Lissa saw the ring, the big, gaudy ring she had gotten after Carla for.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:47:07.01" data-timestamp="2827.01"> The whole thing was just senseless. I remember telling Suna, why didn't you guys just call us? We would have gave you the money just to let her go.</p><p begin="00:47:20.82" data-timestamp="2840.82">[EMOTIONAL]</p><p begin="00:47:21.76" data-timestamp="2841.76">She might have been a little shit, but she was important to us, you know? And I remember standing there for a minute, thinking like, what the fuck am I doing way out here by myself?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:47:49.70" data-timestamp="2869.7"> Lissa had never minded searching for missing people on her own before, but now, suddenly, she felt very alone. She drove down the road to where Suna was waiting for her with several investigators and his family. His mom thanked Lissa. They huddled together as Suna made his confession.</p><p begin="00:48:08.27" data-timestamp="2888.27">Lissa was watching Suna, his rapid speech. She thought he seemed traumatized. She also thought he was telling the truth. And when he was done, he came up to Lissa.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:48:20.05" data-timestamp="2900.05"> He said, I hate to sound so selfish, but I really want to know. Am I going to go to jail today? And I don't know. It seemed like that question kind of made the agents mad.</p><p begin="00:48:37.32" data-timestamp="2917.32">They kind of came over and started talking to me. And they were like, well, Lissa, what do you want? And I said, well, if he's the one that's helping me bring my niece home, then I would like to see him stay-- stay out.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:48:56.33" data-timestamp="2936.33"> That's what the agents did. As Lissa was leaving the reservation, she stopped at Devil's Lake, this vast body of water that blends in with the flatness of the prairie around it. She got out of the car, walked to the edge.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:49:10.16" data-timestamp="2950.16"> And I just looked out there 'cause it's pretty there. I like that territory. There's a lot of spirituality there too. And I just couldn't feel anything.</p><p begin="00:49:25.68" data-timestamp="2965.68">I kept thinking. While I was by that water, I thought, just one feeling, just do one feeling. If you could feel one thing, even if it's hate, or anger, or something, Lissa, just come up with one feeling, because I think there's something wrong with you.</p><p begin="00:49:44.70" data-timestamp="2984.7">[EMOTIONAL] And the only feeling I could feel was gratefulness, gratefulness to Suna that she didn't have to spend another day out there alone. So I put a cigarette down for Carla, and I smoked one, and I left.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:50:25.17" data-timestamp="3025.17"> Another reason Lissa still hardly tells anyone about this case, a reason why it's still so hard for her has to do with what came afterward. Lissa went to Carla's funeral. Loretta, Carla's mom, thanked Lissa, honored her with a star quilt. But then what happened was a kind of unraveling.</p><p begin="00:50:44.63" data-timestamp="3044.63">Prosecutors began building their case against Suna and the two other guys responsible for Carla's murder. And Lissa became the main point of contact for Carla's family. She started going to all the legal meetings, helping Carla's mom understand what was going on. And at the same time, Lissa was still talking to Suna, constantly.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Suna Guy</h4><p begin="00:51:04.21" data-timestamp="3064.21"> But my phone's ready to go dead here.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:51:06.22" data-timestamp="3066.22"> OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Suna Guy</h4><p begin="00:51:07.01" data-timestamp="3067.01"> And if you want to chit-chat throughout the night, I don't mind. I mean, I'm just as well tired too, though, because I stayed up most of the night last night thinking that these guys were going to come through.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:51:22.96" data-timestamp="3082.96"> Yeah. I haven't been sleeping well either.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Suna Guy</h4><p begin="00:51:25.82" data-timestamp="3085.82"> I mean, I don't know. I mean, I'm going to try to sleep some or whatever I can tonight and all that, but--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:51:35.57" data-timestamp="3095.57"> Yeah. I probably will. If I head out tonight, I'll probably call you just for--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Suna Guy</h4><p begin="00:51:46.03" data-timestamp="3106.03"> Just to keep being known that I'm still here, you know what I mean?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:51:50.68" data-timestamp="3110.68"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:51:52.53" data-timestamp="3112.53"> At first, Lissa had a pragmatic reason to keep talking to Suna. She needed him to follow through, to testify in Carla's case against the two other guys involved. Lissa worried for Suna's safety. He wanted witness protection, so she started calling around on his behalf.</p><p begin="00:52:10.54" data-timestamp="3130.54">When the prosecutor found out about this, that Lissa was advocating for Suna, she made Carla's mom, Loretta, the spokesperson for the family and stopped inviting Lissa to meetings, basically iced Lissa out. The court stopped notifying Lissa about hearings in Carla's case. Court officials told her, we only do that for the victim's immediate family.</p><p begin="00:52:38.35" data-timestamp="3158.35">Suna pled guilty to felony murder, meaning he committed a crime that led to Carla's death, even if he didn't intend to murder her. Prosecutors said that Suna didn't plan to murder Carla. He didn't have the gun. He didn't pull the trigger. What Suna planned to do, prosecutors argued, was to rob Carla of drugs.</p><p begin="00:52:58.07" data-timestamp="3178.07">The other two men involved in Carla's murder, they pled out after Suna informed on them. They got 50 and 28-year sentences for a list of charges that included use of a firearm, conspiracy to commit robbery, and second-degree murder.</p><p begin="00:53:13.53" data-timestamp="3193.53">At Suna's sentencing hearing, Lissa sat behind Carla's mother, sister, and a few of Carla's kids. Lissa gave a statement, and she actually spoke on Suna's behalf. She had wanted him to get probation on a lesser charge. Lissa said, I was the person who brought Carla home, and it wouldn't have happened without Suna.</p><p begin="00:53:33.93" data-timestamp="3213.93">She said, I can tell you, a lot of our people are still laying in fields and behind bushes all over this country, and nobody cares. She told the judge it was so rare for people like Suna to come forward, to tell the truth. She asked him to show compassion to Suna, because she said he showed compassion to us.</p><p begin="00:53:53.13" data-timestamp="3233.13">The rest of the hearing, Carla's mother and sister wouldn't even look at Lissa. Lissa kept tapping Loretta on the shoulder, but Loretta just stared ahead, ignored her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:54:02.85" data-timestamp="3242.85"> Loretta was pissed.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:54:05.43" data-timestamp="3245.43"> How did you know Loretta was pissed?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:54:07.77" data-timestamp="3247.77"> Because they all got on Facebook like right outside that court room and were like, Lissa Yellow Bird is over here taking the side of the murderer against my daughter. And then that kind of went out.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:54:23.47" data-timestamp="3263.47"> How did you feel when you saw those posts?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:54:28.43" data-timestamp="3268.43"> I was just like, well, there's been a few families, and she's one of them, where just 100% ungratefulness. But I delivered. Suna didn't kill Carla. I don't have to explain myself to anybody. They weren't there. They didn't have to negotiate with anybody to get their loved one back.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:54:56.41" data-timestamp="3296.41"> Loretta wouldn't talk to me for this story. I reached out to her several times. She didn't respond.</p><p begin="00:55:02.25" data-timestamp="3302.25">Suna was sentenced to 15 years, which is actually a pretty lenient sentence for felony murder, but Lissa was furious. I've never heard her as angry at anyone as she was at the prosecutor in this case, a woman named Jan Morley. Lissa called Jan a slithering snake who was out to get Suna, typical of federal officials who fail tribal communities. So I called Jan, the prosecutor. She's retired now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jan Morley</h4><p begin="00:55:29.00" data-timestamp="3329"> I'm Native American, my background.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:55:32.27" data-timestamp="3332.27"> Oh, really?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jan Morley</h4><p begin="00:55:32.65" data-timestamp="3332.65"> Yes. Right. Grew up on the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation, Belcourt, North Dakota. It's 10 miles from the Canadian border.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:55:40.42" data-timestamp="3340.42"> Wow. I didn't realize that.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:55:42.63" data-timestamp="3342.63"> Lissa didn't realize it either. I asked her later. She sounded surprised. Lissa had told me that in her conversations with Suna, she had begun to see him as a vulnerable adult maybe with a cognitive disability, but Jan didn't see him this way.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jan Morley</h4><p begin="00:55:59.04" data-timestamp="3359.04"> Suna is not a victim in this case. Suna came forward because Suna wanted to save Suna's skin.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:56:09.54" data-timestamp="3369.54"> Do you think-- you know, he said he was scared. How do you feel about that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jan Morley</h4><p begin="00:56:14.91" data-timestamp="3374.91"> I don't believe it. I don't think he was scared. He didn't leave immediately. He stayed there. They went through her stuff. He wanted to be part of the loot.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:56:32.22" data-timestamp="3392.22"> So he spent a lot of time right after Carla was killed with them, you're saying?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jan Morley</h4><p begin="00:56:37.98" data-timestamp="3397.98"> Yeah. They cleaned the car. They disposed of their clothing. He wanted the-- the-- because Suna-- this is Suna. Suna's shoes were new. And they wanted Suna to take his coat off and burn his shoes too, because Suna must have had some blood on his shoes, but Suna wouldn't burn his new shoes. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:56:59.17" data-timestamp="3419.17"> Wow. Was that from text messages? Were you seeing Suna writing text messages, being like, no, I don't want to go burn my shoes?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jan Morley</h4><p begin="00:57:07.72" data-timestamp="3427.72"> No. Suna told us about that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:57:10.38" data-timestamp="3430.38"> Oh, interesting. Huh.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jan Morley</h4><p begin="00:57:12.54" data-timestamp="3432.54"> He said, my shoes are new. I wasn't going to burn my new shoes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:57:16.43" data-timestamp="3436.43"> Lissa was right, actually. Jan had made up her mind about Suna even before Carla's murder. She had prosecuted his rape case 15 years earlier. Jan said it was violent. She remembered this when she began prosecuting Carla's case.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jan Morley</h4><p begin="00:57:31.50" data-timestamp="3451.5"> Suna is very conniving. I wanted Suna to be incarcerated after his plea, but he talked me out of it. And I can't believe he talked me out of it, but he did. It was like, honest to god, Janice, I'll this and-- he always called me by my first name too, called me Janice-- honest to god.</p><p begin="00:57:57.36" data-timestamp="3477.36">And he is one of the most untruthful people I have ever run across. He lies. He lies right to your face. And he'll continue, until you actually have to take the evidence, put it in his face and say, this is the evidence.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:58:18.54" data-timestamp="3498.54"> The evidence in Carla's case is this. In the days before Carla was killed, Suna exchanged hundreds of text messages with Dakota Charbonneau, planning how to rob Carla.</p><p begin="00:58:29.55" data-timestamp="3509.55">The prosecution argued that the murder was an accident. The other guy with them that night tried to threaten Carla with a gun, and the gun went off. But afterward, Suna and Dakota traded more messages about how to cover it up, Jan said.</p><p begin="00:58:44.70" data-timestamp="3524.7">I didn't get to see the evidence, but the story Jan told me seemed so different from the one Suna told Lissa. I didn't know if Lissa knew all of this, so I shared it with her.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:58:56.45" data-timestamp="3536.45"> Does it change anything for you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:58:59.79" data-timestamp="3539.79"> Well, no, it doesn't. I mean, it's not like it's any new information being presented here. I'm sure Suna did want his money. I'm sure he did want drugs. Isn't that what he was there for in the beginning? Do I know that Suna's a sexual deviant? I do. Does that make him a murderer?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:59:20.20" data-timestamp="3560.2"> Yeah, but he was at least partially responsible for Carla's death, right? Doesn't that matter?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="00:59:28.42" data-timestamp="3568.42"> My position is I'm unmoved. I am totally unmoved.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:59:42.54" data-timestamp="3582.54"> Lissa's now helping Suna's lawyer prepare an appeal. When I talked to Suna, he told me that he now looks to Lissa like a mom. He still calls her Lisa, but they speak almost every week. Meanwhile, Lissa and Carla's mother, Loretta, they don't speak anymore.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="00:59:59.82" data-timestamp="3599.82"> Is there any part of you that understands why they're angry?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lissa Yellow Bird</h4><p begin="01:00:05.70" data-timestamp="3605.7"> This is what I say to people every single time when they ask for my help. What are you willing to do to get your loved one back? What are you willing for me to do to get your loved one back? And you know what the answer always is? Anything. Anything.</p><p begin="01:00:26.36" data-timestamp="3626.36">And it's always at the end when they get what they want when the conditions come out. Because in the beginning, you said you wanted to do anything. You were willing for me to do anything to get your loved one home. And I did that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sierra Crane Murdoch</h4><p begin="01:00:51.70" data-timestamp="3651.7"> In this case, the anything Lissa did was to connect with Suna, to get him to trust her. Lissa's sympathy for Suna doesn't surprise me. The thing that drives her to look for people no one else is looking for, it's the same thing that drew her to Suna.</p><p begin="01:01:08.37" data-timestamp="3668.37">I asked Lissa once, why do you do this work? She said, it makes me happy. It makes me happy to help these people who have no hope left in this world. She couldn't save Chucky, she couldn't save Carla, but maybe she could still save Suna.</p></div>  </div>
