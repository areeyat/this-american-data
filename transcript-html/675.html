  <h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.48" data-timestamp="0.48"></p><p begin="00:00:11.06" data-timestamp="11.06">For over 20 years, Eric Capstick's worked for Yankee Stadium. He's a camera operator. During the game, he runs around the crowd, looking for fans to put up on this impossibly huge TV screen that sits over the outfield. And I've seen lots of people work a crowd with a microphone or a camera over the years, and I can say definitively, he is masterful.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Eric Capstick</h4><p begin="00:00:29.50" data-timestamp="29.5"> So I'd appreciate it if you gave me some really great energy, like [GROWLS] you know, positive Yankee energy. Are you guys a bachelorette party or something?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Women</h4><p begin="00:00:39.37" data-timestamp="39.37"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Eric Capstick</h4><p begin="00:00:40.13" data-timestamp="40.13"> All right. I'm going to try and get you for the second shot.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Women</h4><p begin="00:00:42.65" data-timestamp="42.65"> Yay.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:43.25" data-timestamp="43.25"> He's this lanky, friendly guy. By the way, he seems to know everybody working in the stadium.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Eric Capstick</h4><p begin="00:00:48.53" data-timestamp="48.53"> Daphne and Curtis.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:00:49.29" data-timestamp="49.29"> What's good?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Eric Capstick</h4><p begin="00:00:50.00" data-timestamp="50"> What's up, bro?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:51.03" data-timestamp="51.03"> When he walks past, he tosses them pieces of bubblegum that he swiped from the Yankees dugout.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Eric Capstick</h4><p begin="00:00:55.22" data-timestamp="55.22"> Danny.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:55.58" data-timestamp="55.58"> A piece of gum arcs through the air.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Eric Capstick</h4><p begin="00:00:58.86" data-timestamp="58.86"> Oh, he dropped it. He dropped it. But usually, he has pretty good hands. I like to say that half the people in the building can't catch. It's pretty accurate, actually.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:10.46" data-timestamp="70.46"> The whole purpose of putting fans up on the big screen is to keep the crowd energized between innings, when nothing's happening on the field. So what Eric's looking for is pumped up, passionate fans.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Eric Capstick</h4><p begin="00:01:20.09" data-timestamp="80.09"> Sometimes fans ask for Kiss Cam. I'm like, no, you got to go to Queens for Kiss Cam. We don't do Kiss Cam here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:27.25" data-timestamp="87.25"> You get that Queens reference? He's saying Kiss Cam's the kind of low-brow garbage that you see at Mets games.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Eric Capstick</h4><p begin="00:01:33.44" data-timestamp="93.44"> How are you doing? Hi, I want to get the kids. I mean, you know, primarily, so you should sit, probably.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:40.42" data-timestamp="100.42"> He's talking to some teachers and parents of kids from a school, PS 71 in the Bronx. They're here on a class trip.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Eric Capstick</h4><p begin="00:01:46.76" data-timestamp="106.76"> You don't want to be in it?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:48.18" data-timestamp="108.18"> Eric likes to position himself between the people who he's shooting and the screen, so they can actually see themselves on the huge screen right over his shoulder. Sometimes that means perching himself over the edge of a balcony, but not this time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Eric Capstick</h4><p begin="00:02:01.80" data-timestamp="121.8"> We're about 10 seconds away.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:05.27" data-timestamp="125.27"> Everybody waits. It feels like a long time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Eric Capstick</h4><p begin="00:02:08.52" data-timestamp="128.52"> Here we go. You're up. Hey, you're [INAUDIBLE].</p><p begin="00:02:12.73" data-timestamp="132.73">[CHEERING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Child</h4><p begin="00:02:13.68" data-timestamp="133.68"> Cool!</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:16.53" data-timestamp="136.53"> Have you been on TV before?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Child</h4><p begin="00:02:18.00" data-timestamp="138"> No.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:19.02" data-timestamp="139.02"> So how was it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Child</h4><p begin="00:02:21.09" data-timestamp="141.09"> I don't know. Exciting, yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:25.02" data-timestamp="145.02"> And so what's so fun about being on TV?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Child 2</h4><p begin="00:02:28.38" data-timestamp="148.38"> Like, you just get to see yourself on there, and it makes you feel famous.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:35.73" data-timestamp="155.73"> How did you know what to do when the camera went on you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Child 2</h4><p begin="00:02:38.85" data-timestamp="158.85"> Well, I've seen people and what they do. Like, they wave and stuff.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:44.21" data-timestamp="164.21"> Duh-- even if you're in fourth grade. The camera's a magic wand. Somebody points it at you, you know what to do. A few friends sitting near these kids-- Kristen, and Joanne, and Howie-- they saw Eric, and they called out to him that he should shoot them next because it was Joanne's birthday. Eric saw right through that. I didn't.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:02.49" data-timestamp="182.49"> It's your birthday?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joanne</h4><p begin="00:03:03.73" data-timestamp="183.73"> No, it's not my birthday. He lied because I wanted to be on the camera.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:07.32" data-timestamp="187.32"> Why do you want to be on the camera?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joanne</h4><p begin="00:03:09.21" data-timestamp="189.21"> I don't know. Because I love the Yankees, and I'm happy to be here. And I want all my friends to be on TV.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:14.28" data-timestamp="194.28"> Kristen and her friend was actually on the big screen once.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kristen</h4><p begin="00:03:16.96" data-timestamp="196.96"> Oh my god, it's so exciting. People saw me on TV, and they texted me from home [INAUDIBLE]. We see you on camera. It was my moment of fame. I've never been on TV before. I was on TV.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joanne</h4><p begin="00:03:27.54" data-timestamp="207.54"> Well, we actually were on TV once last-- two seasons ago. There was a ball that came out, and our friend--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kristen</h4><p begin="00:03:34.30" data-timestamp="214.3"> [INAUDIBLE]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Howie</h4><p begin="00:03:34.80" data-timestamp="214.8"> [INAUDIBLE] first home run, and our friend caught the ball and dropped it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joanne</h4><p begin="00:03:38.87" data-timestamp="218.87"> And it fell right on our seats, and we all bent over to get it. And then we watched SportsCenter that night, and you saw all of us like, ahh, and bent over. And that's our one time we were on TV.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:51.95" data-timestamp="231.95"> So they were on SportsCenter-- SportsCenter. It's so far away in the stands, so small on the screen, that nobody they knew recognized them. Nobody texted, nobody called. Yet still, it's kind of satisfying.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joanne</h4><p begin="00:04:06.69" data-timestamp="246.69"> Like I DVRed SportsCenter and then paused it and took pictures of the TV. And every year it shows up in my Facebook memories, I share it. I'm like, oh, that's when Wayne blew the ball. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:22.88" data-timestamp="262.88"> You're only on the big screen at the stadium for a few seconds. But to get there, one woman told me, it makes your day. Another said she was recognized on the subway on the way home from a game that she had been on the screen. It's like this thrilling thing the Yankees can bestow on any lucky fan. So much better than a bobblehead. Because who doesn't want to get on TV?</p><p begin="00:04:42.94" data-timestamp="282.94">Well, today on our program, non-TV people suddenly find themselves on TV. They didn't expect it. They didn't ask for it. They just found out they were, whether they wanted it or didn't want it. And some definitely did not want it. Others didn't even know it was happening because they're babies. What that kind of attention can do to you. From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:13.96" data-timestamp="313.96"> Act I. Anything You Say Can and Will Be Used on Television. So since the 1980s, there's been a way that tons of ordinary Americans suddenly found themselves on TV, though it probably was not how they wanted to be making their TV debuts.</p><p begin="00:05:28.87" data-timestamp="328.87">[SIRENS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:05:29.67" data-timestamp="329.67"> Stop. Stop. Stop. OK.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:34.84" data-timestamp="334.84"> So if you live in this country, you probably know the TV show <i>Cops.</i> This particular clip is from a kind of updated version of <i>Cops</i> called <i>Live</i> <i>PD,</i> which is made by a different company. It's actually more popular than <i>Cops</i> these days. And with me to discuss this is Dan Taberski. And Dan, you have watched a lot of these shows over the years.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:05:50.58" data-timestamp="350.58"> I have. I have watched a lot of <i>Cops.</i> I've watched a lot of <i>Cops</i> over the years-- too much.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:55.20" data-timestamp="355.2"> And I know that one of the things that's interested you about that show and that you enjoy when you watch a show, it comes from the fact that you yourself used to make television.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:06:02.27" data-timestamp="362.27"> Yeah, I did for a long time. And a lot of reality shows, too, mostly kid shows and game shows, silly stuff. But I know what tricks that you employ in making a reality show. And I've always wondered, how were they doing this? What are the tricks that they're using? What's the difference between what they're showing me on TV versus reality?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:23.85" data-timestamp="383.85"> Like, what really happened?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:06:24.83" data-timestamp="384.83"> Yeah, yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:25.98" data-timestamp="385.98"> And you have a new podcast about this very question. It's called <i>Running</i> <i>from</i> <i>Cops.</i> I've listened to the whole thing. It's a great show. And in this show, you take that question apart for <i>Cops</i> and for <i>Live</i> <i>PD.</i> And I think before we get further, you should explain what <i>Live</i> <i>PD</i> is for the people who haven't seen it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:06:42.04" data-timestamp="402.04"> Yeah, the thing about <i>Live</i> <i>PD</i> is that half the country doesn't even know what it is. And in the meantime, it was the most DVRed show of 2018. It's three hours long of live policing on Friday night and then another three hours of live policing on Saturday night.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:57.04" data-timestamp="417.04"> So it is a lot of hours of television. And just so people can picture the show, describe what <i>Live</i> <i>PD</i> looks like, what makes it different from <i>Cops.</i></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:07:05.91" data-timestamp="425.91"> <i>Live</i> <i>PD</i> is mainly different because it's live. It's basically set up like any SBN show. So there's a host, and there's all these monitors behind him. And the monitors are following six to eight police departments around the country live. And he just keeps cutting to different police departments to show you the highlights of what's going on right now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:07:26.55" data-timestamp="446.55"> Let's go right now to Jeffersonville. Both of the officers, Alyssa Wright and Denver Leverett, are serving as backup on a speeding pullover. Let's see why.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 2</h4><p begin="00:07:38.18" data-timestamp="458.18"> Both hands out the window.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:07:40.30" data-timestamp="460.3"> Both hands out the window.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:42.00" data-timestamp="462"> And then they go back to the studio, where there's a couple of police officers offering analysis and color commentary about what they're seeing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 3</h4><p begin="00:07:48.37" data-timestamp="468.37"> If they're aggressive, you're going to try to use less lethal to taser, pepper spray, to try to control the situation. Now you're dealing with a dog and the suspect at the same time. It makes it a lot more difficult.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 4</h4><p begin="00:07:56.93" data-timestamp="476.93"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:07:57.69" data-timestamp="477.69"> So one thing that's interesting about <i>Live</i> <i>PD</i> is that it premiered in 2016, right? Right when there was this proliferation of people filming their own police interactions on their own phones and putting it on YouTube. And it really changed the conversation around policing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:10.95" data-timestamp="490.95"> Lots of videos of people getting shot by the police.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:08:13.05" data-timestamp="493.05"> Yeah, and <i>Live</i> <i>PD</i> consciously positions itself and markets itself as a response to all that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:18.42" data-timestamp="498.42"> To the videos.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:08:19.29" data-timestamp="499.29"> Right. Like, we're going to go a step further than your iPhone video or your body cam. We will bring it to you live. It doesn't get more real than this. That's their position. So here's a promotional video they put up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:08:31.44" data-timestamp="511.44"> Being able to see exactly what the police are doing and how they're doing it is beneficial to everyone.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 2</h4><p begin="00:08:37.38" data-timestamp="517.38"> The cell phone changed everything. Being able to instantly load video up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 3</h4><p begin="00:08:41.71" data-timestamp="521.71"> You have to be very carefully in these situations.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 4</h4><p begin="00:08:43.18" data-timestamp="523.18"> They only put up what they want to put up. They don't get the whole interaction.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:08:46.84" data-timestamp="526.84"> So for police departments wanting to get their side out in this atmosphere, <i>Live</i> <i>PD</i> is great on TV and also social media. Unlike <i>Cops,</i> which is sort of old school, <i>Live</i> <i>PD</i> has a big social media presence. It's a live show. People tweet along live. They have a rabid fan base. During the show, the police departments will actually tweet, if you liked seeing Pasco County, Florida, for example, on <i>Live</i> <i>PD,</i> here's how you can apply to become an officer yourself. So I spoke to this one guy, Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich. He's the sheriff in Spokane, Washington. And that's one of the places where <i>Live</i> <i>PD's</i> been filming.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ozzie Knezovich</h4><p begin="00:09:20.71" data-timestamp="560.71"> This thing has tapped into something that I can't explain. I've never seen anything like it before-- not in 28 years. I can tell you that <i>Live</i> <i>PD</i> has done wonders for our recruiting.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:09:32.46" data-timestamp="572.46"> Really? How?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ozzie Knezovich</h4><p begin="00:09:34.23" data-timestamp="574.23"> Applications-- people calling us all over the country.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:09:38.21" data-timestamp="578.21"> Really?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ozzie Knezovich</h4><p begin="00:09:38.70" data-timestamp="578.7"> Yes. It's been amazing. It's been amazing the amount of Christmas cards we got from people all over the country.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:09:46.23" data-timestamp="586.23"> Get out of here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ozzie Knezovich</h4><p begin="00:09:47.31" data-timestamp="587.31"> No. It shows people at their worst. Well, no, it shows what we're dealing with. It shows what society is dealing with.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:57.98" data-timestamp="597.98"> So one of the things that's the most interesting about your series, <i>Running</i> <i>from</i> <i>Cops,</i> is that you really do try to figure out what is the gap between what the programs show us and what really happened out on the street. And as part of that, you and your team watched how many hours?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:10:12.52" data-timestamp="612.52"> 846 episodes of <i>Cops.</i></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:15.38" data-timestamp="615.38"> Wow.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:10:16.42" data-timestamp="616.42"> And for <i>Live</i> <i>PD,</i> we watched hundreds of hours.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:19.39" data-timestamp="619.39"> And the 846 episodes of <i>Cops,</i> why 846?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:10:22.51" data-timestamp="622.51"> That's all we can get. [LAUGHS] That is what was available to us. There have been over 1,000, and we could get 846.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:31.76" data-timestamp="631.76"> And so now, what we've done is we've asked you to do an excerpt from your series here for us, where you try to figure out the gap between what we see on these two programs and what really happened, and where you talk to the people getting arrested on <i>Live</i> <i>PD</i> and on <i>Cops</i> about the experience of being reluctantly put on television.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:10:48.58" data-timestamp="648.58"> Right.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:49.30" data-timestamp="649.3"> And so what's going to happen now is you're going to start with <i>Cops</i> and then go to <i>Live</i> <i>PD.</i> Take it away.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:10:55.82" data-timestamp="655.82"> We'll start here. This is <i>Cops,</i> 2013, season 26, episode 14. This scene happens in Gwinnett County, Georgia. It's after midnight, and an officer pulls up on two teenagers. They're parked in a church parking lot.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Officer</h4><p begin="00:11:12.03" data-timestamp="672.03"> Hey, how are you doing?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Teenager 1</h4><p begin="00:11:13.06" data-timestamp="673.06"> Great, how are you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Officer</h4><p begin="00:11:14.23" data-timestamp="674.23"> Good.

In that segment we just watched, there's no music. There's no narrator. It's just edited-down observational filming of police at work. That's what I like about it. And it's that style that makes it so believable to the casual viewer. It is what it is-- until it's not.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:13:11.98" data-timestamp="791.98"> Did you always want to be a police officer?

He's a former narcotics officer, and he loved it. But after 14 years on the job, he went to law school. He's been a defense attorney ever since here in Buford, Georgia, where he was retained by that young woman in that <i>Cops</i> episode that we just heard.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Burdges</h4><p begin="00:13:43.29" data-timestamp="823.29"> I thought she was guilty, having been in law enforcement. And I'm very fond of the police, and I'm very pro-police. But I just thought it was a regular episode. So did her family, and so did the district attorney, and so did everybody else.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:13:58.81" data-timestamp="838.81"> Until, that is, a secondary test on that drug sample taken on the scene came back from the lab.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Burdges</h4><p begin="00:14:04.90" data-timestamp="844.9"> The alleged cocaine came back negative from the state lab that it was not cocaine.

But it was certainly not a drug.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:14:14.29" data-timestamp="854.29"> In fact, that roadside drug test in that episode, they do them all the time on <i>Cops.</i> The colors tell you if it's coke or not. Easy-peasy. But what they never say on <i>Cops,</i> and which I didn't know myself, until now, is that, in fact, those tests, pretty much every jurisdiction in the country says they are inadmissible at trial, including Gwinnett County, Georgia, where that young woman and her boyfriend were arrested. But when that test pops up as blue on <i>Cops,</i> they never say, well, we'll see how the official test comes back. They say--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Officer</h4><p begin="00:14:45.08" data-timestamp="885.08"> And that would be cocaine.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:14:47.14" data-timestamp="887.14"> But it wasn't. And that's not the only discrepancy that John Burdges learned about as this case progressed. The cop didn't just open the car door and find the suspected drugs, like on the show. He searched for 14 minutes before testing anything. And he didn't just do one test, like they show in that episode. He actually tested it two times for coke before it came back blue. One month after the official test results showed it wasn't cocaine, the producers of <i>Cops</i> aired that episode anyway, attracting the wrong kind of notoriety for Burgess' client.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Burdges</h4><p begin="00:15:21.85" data-timestamp="921.85"> And in fact, she ended up, over a period of a few months, moving out of Gwinnett County, where she grew up, several miles away.

And nobody cares.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:15:44.22" data-timestamp="944.22"> Burgess's client didn't want to talk to me. She's trying to put the whole thing behind her. But why would she have agreed to be on <i>Cops</i> in the first place? Because the thing is for pretty much any reality show, <i>Cops</i> included, the producers do need your consent to show your face on their show, usually by signing a consent form. Why would anyone who just got arrested sign that piece of paper?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Langley</h4><p begin="00:16:08.47" data-timestamp="968.47"> Well, you got to talk to people, and you got to persuade them.

At this stage of our show's life, people know the show, and it has a certain pop cultural iconic value. And they'll say, get those news cameras away from me.

And I've always found it hard to believe, but you kind of gotta take his word for it, unless you're going to track down the people who have been filmed by <i>Cops</i> and ask them yourself. And so we did.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Corey Robinson</h4><p begin="00:17:02.03" data-timestamp="1022.03"> Because I was given a choice. Sign if I go to jail. I don't feel like the TV show should have anything to do with my freedom.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:17:08.64" data-timestamp="1028.64"> Corey Robinson was chased and filmed by <i>Cops</i> on his 18th birthday, while he was hanging out in a park in Tampa, Florida. And he says when he was sitting in the back of a police car, the first person to approach him wasn't a cop, but rather a producer from <i>Cops,</i> the show, who told him--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Corey Robinson</h4><p begin="00:17:26.08" data-timestamp="1046.08"> I need you to sign this release form, or you're going to jail with a felony trespassing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:17:31.80" data-timestamp="1051.8"> So Corey says no way.

He was like, yeah, you should take him up on his offer. He's trying to help you. You need to sign the paper, or you go to jail. He put the window up, and he walked away.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:17:52.45" data-timestamp="1072.45"> In fact, of the nine people we were able to find who had been filmed by <i>Cops,</i> all but one say they didn't sign a release, were too drunk or high to do it willingly, or they were coerced into it, like Corey Robinson. And that young woman in that video that I played you, the cocaine bust that turned out to not be cocaine--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Officer</h4><p begin="00:18:11.71" data-timestamp="1091.71"> Does that not look like cocaine?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Teenager</h4><p begin="00:18:13.84" data-timestamp="1093.84"> What is that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Officer</h4><p begin="00:18:15.06" data-timestamp="1095.06"> Cocaine.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:18:16.44" data-timestamp="1096.44"> According to her attorney, John Burdges--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Burdges</h4><p begin="00:18:18.78" data-timestamp="1098.78"> They told her, you either sign this waiver, or you won't get a bond. So you're sitting in jail in a holding area. You're 18 years old, and you can't get out of jail unless you sign this piece of paper. So yeah, she signed a waiver, but it was not voluntary. Nothing's voluntary when you got handcuffs on.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:18:39.81" data-timestamp="1119.81"> The producers of <i>Cops</i> maintain that they don't coerce subjects to sign consent forms and that they won't even consider a segment for the show unless they have a signed release in hand. A spokesperson told us sometimes people sign, then regret it, and make, quote, "outrageous allegations." So that's <i>Cops.</i> There's more going on than what you see on screen.</p><p begin="00:19:02.08" data-timestamp="1142.08">But what about <i>Live</i> <i>PD?</i> I mean, it's live. How do you manipulate live? Nothing is more it is what it is than a live TV show, right? No one from <i>Live</i> <i>PD</i> would talk to us about the show or how it's produced. And so we set out to find the answer ourselves by tracking down suspects who have been on the show and having conversations about what actually ended up on television. In the past three years, they've shot in over 30 cities. And so we picked one-- Spokane, Washington.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:19:34.35" data-timestamp="1174.35"> Welcome back. Let's go to Spokane County, Washington.

And like a lot of places, they've got a pretty serious opioid problem. The city's been on 99 hours of <i>Live</i> <i>PD.</i> And so me and my producers, we watched them all.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Officer</h4><p begin="00:19:58.74" data-timestamp="1198.74"> Meth or heroin, James?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>James</h4><p begin="00:20:00.37" data-timestamp="1200.37"> Not doing anything.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Officer</h4><p begin="00:20:01.26" data-timestamp="1201.26"> All right, James, you have the right to remain silent.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Taberski</h4><p begin="00:20:04.06" data-timestamp="1204.06"> The goal was to look for clues as to the suspect's identity. They only say their first names, if even that. So we look for a first name, or a street sign maybe, so that we could see where the arrest happened. And then we would cross-reference that with court records from around the same time, trying to find a match. And that is how my producer Henry and I met Amy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Henry</h4><p begin="00:20:24.21" data-timestamp="1224.21"> What do you think?

Whereas pretty much any other reality show needs the consent of people who appear on their show, <i>Live</i> <i>PD</i> makes a different case. Because it's live, or close to live-- they're actually on a delay. It's somewhere between 10 and 40 minutes. But because it's live, <i>Live</i> <i>PD</i> says, hey, we're basically news. And news doesn't need consent from suspects, so why should we? At least that's what they've argued in court. So for people like Amy, there is no consent involved here. You're on the show whether you like it or not.

  <h3>Act Two: Born to Play the Part</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:37:34.61" data-timestamp="2254.61"> It's <i>This American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Today's program, I'm on TV. Stories of people who are used to being on the watching side of television, the normal side of television, who suddenly, without choosing, are placed on the other side of the screen. Or maybe the best way to say that is they're inside the screen. I don't know.</p><p begin="00:37:51.22" data-timestamp="2271.22">What's that do to you? We've arrived at Act 2 of our program. Act 2, "Born To Play The Part." I know somebody who whenever we would watch a film or TV show, if there was a dog in the scene, they always did the same thing-- they would turn to me and say, dog doesn't know it's in a movie. Or dog doesn't know that's Mel Gibson. Dog doesn't know that Neil Patrick Harris. Same thing if a baby showed up. Baby doesn't know that's Meryl Streep. Baby doesn't know it's in a film.</p><p begin="00:38:18.83" data-timestamp="2298.83">One of our producers, Bim Adewunmi, is also a big noticer or of babies on television, including one in particular that she's become slightly obsessed with. Here's Bim.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:38:29.84" data-timestamp="2309.84"> OK. So it's an uncharacteristically peaceful scene in the sixth season of <i>The</i> <i>Walking</i> <i>Dead.</i> No zombies, no gore. There's a man, the hero of the show, Rick Grimes and his teenage son Carl. The whole scene has a cloud of awkward family tension, but nothing more perilous than that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rick Grimes</h4><p begin="00:38:49.17" data-timestamp="2329.17"> Get your stuff. Gabriel can take care of Judith while we're gone.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Grimes</h4><p begin="00:38:54.30" data-timestamp="2334.3"> I'm not coming.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:38:56.22" data-timestamp="2336.22"> But wait. There's a third character in the scene. She's wearing a lilac smock dress, and she's got a pacifier in her mouth. She's a baby, and she's adorable. Her name is Judith. So anyway, Rick is carrying Judith towards Carl in the street. And as they approach, the baby spots the teen and she waves. It's obviously unscripted, because how could you script a toddler?</p><p begin="00:39:21.68" data-timestamp="2361.68">And you can see the actor playing her dad, Andrew Lincoln, look down and smile in surprise. All through the scene Judy goes through baby's greatest hits. She fidgets. She sucks on her pacifier. She makes sounds that the subtitles caption as babbling. And with one arm wrapped around Rick's bicep, she swivels her head back and forth, just observing her environment.</p><p begin="00:39:47.12" data-timestamp="2387.12">And then she does the one thing you're not supposed to do. She spots the camera, and then proceeds very happily to break the fourth wall. She stares, and I mean stares down the barrel of the camera. Her focus, laser-sharp. Above her head, acting with a capital A, is happening. This is the highest-rated cable show in America.</p><p begin="00:40:12.27" data-timestamp="2412.27">But to this baby, who knows nothing about craft, or dramaturgy, or anything else or the televisual arts, there's only a great big camera. And as far as she understands life, it's there to be looked at. A few things go through my mind whenever I watch this scene.</p><p begin="00:40:29.87" data-timestamp="2429.87">That this must have been the best take of the day. I don't know why, but that tickles me. The idea of a Hollywood set being at the mercy of a baby's whims is just joyous to me. Judith has been around on the show since the third season, the first baby born to our heroes since the dead began roaming the Earth. The parade of babies who played her in seasons 3 to 5 were fine.</p><p begin="00:40:55.84" data-timestamp="2455.84">But the Judith they cast in season 6, ah, the platonic ideal of cute baby. Cheeks, heavy and jowly. Mouth rosebud. Eyes wide and bright. Can a baby have charisma? Well, this baby had charisma. First of all, she was a surprisingly good actor sometimes.</p><p begin="00:41:17.44" data-timestamp="2477.44">Take season 6, episode 9, "No Way Out."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rick Grimes</h4><p begin="00:41:20.63" data-timestamp="2480.63"> All right.

And so the survivors have to mask their scent by wearing sheets smeared in Walker guts to get through the horde.</p><p begin="00:41:39.72" data-timestamp="2499.72">Eventually, the group is forced to split up, and Judy gets passed from her brother, who's carrying her under his sheet, to another member of the group.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Grimes</h4><p begin="00:41:47.74" data-timestamp="2507.74"> I'll take her.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:41:49.68" data-timestamp="2509.68"> There's a tight shot of Judy's little face as she gets transferred, fake blood on her cheek. And she looks 100% stressed out, like she's thinking, for god's sake, what now? And of course she thinks that. Look around her. It's all zombies. She's not acting at all, which of course makes her the best actor in the scene. Talk about method. We get Judith in short bursts, mere seconds at a time. I've inadvertently watched her grow up.

The twins that play Judith, their names are Sofia and Chloe Garcia-Frizzi.</p><p begin="00:42:43.98" data-timestamp="2563.98">I cannot stress this enough. The Garcia-Frizzi twins might be the cutest babies I have ever seen, on telly or in real life. Top three, definitely. They arrived in their butterball prime, all round and squishy.

Because being a baby, you're often the center of attention. You have someone who prepares your food and drives you around. It's not so different from being famous. There's no way a baby would know they were getting special attention.</p><p begin="00:43:27.39" data-timestamp="2607.39">Babies just expect that. I talked to the Garcia-Frizzi twins' mother, Tiffany, to ask if the girls knew they were famous now that they're five.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tiffany Garcia-frizzi</h4><p begin="00:43:36.82" data-timestamp="2616.82"> It's actually really, really funny, because until my oldest daughter told them that they were famous, they legitimately did not now.

And it's like, no not everybody's on a TV show.</p><p begin="00:43:51.71" data-timestamp="2631.71">So until their older sister was like no, you guys are on TV. You're famous.

Like, strangers know who they are. I don't think they really necessarily connected it to fame yet.</p><p begin="00:44:21.25" data-timestamp="2661.25">But they will tell people they're Judith Grimes.

The other sees that moment on television, and it sticks with her for years.</p><p begin="00:45:22.53" data-timestamp="2722.53">The second girl in the story is Lina Misitzis, one of the producers of our show. A piece of background you need to know to understand this story-- she was really into musical theater as a kid.

Here she is.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:45:37.65" data-timestamp="2737.65"> I know when it started. It was in Greece-- the country, not the musical. I spent part of my childhood there. I was six or seven years old when I found a two-disk CD set at the bottom of some sales bin, a best of Broadway compilation from various European tours of Broadway shows, all in different languages.

Back in America, in my bedroom in Virginia, I Scotch-taped up pictures of Ethel Merman, Bernadette Peters, Bebe Neuwirth. On weekends, I checked casting calls in the <i>Washington</i> <i>Post.</i> My mom's rule was if an audition was less than five miles away, I could try out. I recorded the Tonys on VHS each year, watched it over and over.</p><p begin="00:46:46.13" data-timestamp="2806.13">Same for "Sound Of Music" and "Fiddler on the Roof." But the tape I watched the most, the one that spoke to me more than any other, was this 1997 TV special. Barbara Walters hosted, and it was called "Broadway's New Annie: Search For A Star." and if the title doesn't give it away, here's the premise. The musical "Annie" was coming back to Broadway and the show's director needed to find a star. And this was how he decided to do it, on TV.</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:47:14.88" data-timestamp="2834.88"> Little girls, little girls, 2,000 little girls all sharing the same dream.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl</h4><p begin="00:47:21.91" data-timestamp="2841.91"> Annie, Annie, Annie, Annie, Annie.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:47:24.06" data-timestamp="2844.06"> I was 8, the same age as those girls. I could have auditioned if I'd known about it. It was a nationwide contest sponsored by the department store Macy's, and there was a Macy's less than five miles from my house. To watch, I dressed up like an orphan, and the closest thing I came up with was wearing my older brother's underwear.</p><p begin="00:47:43.53" data-timestamp="2863.53">I'd stand in front of the TV transfixed, so close my mom would yell at me that I was going to damage my eyes. And the person I was watching for was this one girl named Harley who reminded me of me because she was special, perfect for the role in every way, which I figured I'd be. Although Harley had the advantage of also looking the part-- long red wavy hair, chubby cheeks. The sort of aw, shucks grin you want to see on Annie's face.

The guy she's auditioning for is Martin Charnin. He wrote "Annie" back in 1976. He was the show's original director. That's him you hear singing along with her. Martin takes Harley by the hand, and leads her away from all the other girls.</p><p begin="00:48:58.65" data-timestamp="2938.65">He cups her chin in his palm, and places her on the floor by his feet, and together they watch more Annie hopefuls audition.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Harley Ott</h4><p begin="00:49:06.92" data-timestamp="2946.92"> Then I sat with the director, and then he let me watch.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Martin Charnin</h4><p begin="00:49:10.81" data-timestamp="2950.81"> So 149 was singing with you, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barbara Walters</h4><p begin="00:49:13.02" data-timestamp="2953.02"> Something about the little girl's face makes Martin want to see her again.
