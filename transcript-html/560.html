  <h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.79" data-timestamp="0.79">Every year in the fall, in countries all over the world, signs go up advertising a lottery, a lottery whose winners move to the United States, get a green card, and become Americans. And though it might sound crazy to you, and impossible--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reuben Henry</h4><p begin="00:00:16.42" data-timestamp="16.42">Everybody know, I mean everybody. This sign is all over on the street, all over, in the stores, in the shops. Everywhere you pass, you see it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:25.98" data-timestamp="25.98">That's Reuben Henry who runs an internet cafe in Liberia. The lottery application is online, so internet cafes are where lots of people apply. They're the ones who put up the signs advertising it. This year, Reuben says, over 1,000 people put in applications at his place. He doesn't know any Liberian who hasn't heard of it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reuben Henry</h4><p begin="00:00:43.38" data-timestamp="43.38">Not anyone at all, except the baby who was born today.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:49.55" data-timestamp="49.55">If you haven't heard of this lottery, it's probably because you already live here and you don't need it. It's not a scam. It's a real thing run by the United States government every year called the Diversity Visa lottery, or the DV lottery for short. The idea is to get a more varied group of immigrants from a diversity of countries into our country. In any given year, between 8 and 15 million people apply with over 100,000 winners.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Bala</h4><p begin="00:01:12.83" data-timestamp="72.83">[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:01:14.74" data-timestamp="74.74">Some of them are very quiet and they start to cry.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:18.18" data-timestamp="78.18">I spoke to this man, Mr. Bala, with an interpreter. He owns a cyber cafe in Sri Lanka. He says he gets about 800 applicants a year at his place, and about 20 winners.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Bala</h4><p begin="00:01:27.47" data-timestamp="87.47"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:01:28.29" data-timestamp="88.29">Some, according to him, jump up and down and they just scream, and so excited. While yet the rest will be, you know, banging on the walls and just screaming their head off and hugging Mr. Bala or anybody who's nearby that they were so happy that they were selected.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:45.30" data-timestamp="105.3">The way it works, people apply online in October, the winners are randomly chosen, and the results are posted in May. At a cyber cafe in the Congo, when Eric Muamba told one woman, "God's blessed you, you've won," she kissed him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Eric Muamba</h4><p begin="00:01:58.85" data-timestamp="118.85"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:02:01.99" data-timestamp="121.99">And I was so embarrassed that-- since the husband was there, I also ran to the husband and hugged the husband, you know, just to cool the tension, because I did not want her husband to think-- I mean, to have some ideas.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:20.34" data-timestamp="140.34">In Kenya, Michael Kadi Abu Niwa had the very first winner in his cybercafe two years ago. Basically he just noticed a commotion over at the computers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michael Kadi Abu Niwa</h4><p begin="00:02:28.79" data-timestamp="148.79">Shouting, laughing, trying to shake him. And the guys were around there, "you won it! You won it!"</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:34.00" data-timestamp="154">Mike told the guy, "you're now an American."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michael Kadi Abu Niwa</h4><p begin="00:02:35.99" data-timestamp="155.99">Hey, you are now an American. You are now an American. You're going to a land of opportunities, and remember us when you're there. When you leave this country, don't forget about us. That's what I told him.</p><p begin="00:02:50.43" data-timestamp="170.43"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:51.82" data-timestamp="171.82">The guy who won that day was not a Kenyan. He was a Somali refugee named Abdi, Abdi Nor. He remembers the moment this way. He sat down at the computer.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:03:01.61" data-timestamp="181.61">I put my confirmation number. I put my date of birth, and then clicked submit. There was a few seconds of silence, then "you have been randomly selected."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:17.24" data-timestamp="197.24">Everybody went nuts, lifted him up in the air in his chair. But Abdi didn't believe it. He asked his friends to put him down and started entering his information into the computer again, and again.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:03:29.35" data-timestamp="209.35">It's the same answer, the same response. I put in-- same response. I realized I won. I walked out with these friends all shouting behind me, in front of me, you know, holding my hands, shaking me. My heart was bumping. I was not holding myself together.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:48.85" data-timestamp="228.85">Moving to America seemed like a done deal. But he didn't know the half of it. Abdi is who our show's about today, and winning the lottery was an especially big deal for Abdi because, really more than anybody he knew, Abdi had been obsessed with America since he was little. As a kid growing up in Mogadishu, Somalia, he would go to the movies which, in Mogadishu just meant a TV perched on a table in a shack.</p><p begin="00:04:12.67" data-timestamp="252.67">And he would bring a pen and paper to watch American films so he could write down any words he didn't know and learn the language better. He became known to people as the guy who could translate the movie for you. Stuff would happened on screen and everybody would turn to Abdi, who would shout out, "he says he's about to kill that guy."</p><p begin="00:04:28.19" data-timestamp="268.19">He pronounces English like an American. That's why his accent is so amazing when you hear him, which led to his nickname, that all his friends called him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:04:36.56" data-timestamp="276.56">Abdi the American. That's my name. That's my nickname.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:39.79" data-timestamp="279.79">And as he got older, he devoted himself to the goal of getting to America, not only studying English, but also teaching it. He did some radio stories in English. And you can totally understand why he'd want to leave his country, right?</p><p begin="00:04:51.18" data-timestamp="291.18">He grew up in Somalia. For years there was no functioning government. There was rival warlords and militias and just anarchy, dangerous and violent. And there were bombings and attacks from the terrorist group al-Shabaab, which is affiliated with al-Qaeda. Abdi says for him, or really for any man in his 20s in Somalia, it's hard to stay out of the fight. You can't just be neutral and go about your life.</p><p begin="00:05:15.44" data-timestamp="315.44">He tells stories of al-Shabaab members threatening him to join them, or else. At one checkpoint on the way to his mom's they told him, basically, next time you come through here, you'd better be one of us. So it was that or join the government forces who were fighting al-Shabaab, or he could flee the country.</p><p begin="00:05:32.71" data-timestamp="332.71">You know those boats full of people who are trying to cross the Mediterranean to get to Europe, and sometimes they sink, and hundreds of people drown? Abdi knows people who have gone on those boats, and on boats like them, to escape to Yemen.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:05:45.20" data-timestamp="345.2">Yes. I've lost three very good friends. And one of these friends had his child, less than a year old, with his wife. He knew how to swim, but he could not swim because his child was-- you know, he was trying to save his child and his wife. And then they were caught up in the sea and sharks.</p><p begin="00:06:03.09" data-timestamp="363.09">They were not the only ones who died there. 75 other Somalis were killed in that journey. And that has changed nothing about our decision. That doesn't scare us a lot. We know death is there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:16.52" data-timestamp="376.52">Several times, Abdi planned to take one of those boats, but he had trouble getting the money together, and eventually his mom talked him out of it. So instead, he escaped across the border to Kenya. Somalia and Kenya are next to each other. Abdi moved to Nairobi, enrolled in a university, tried twice for a student visa to America, was denied both times. And if he hadn't gotten lucky that day in the cybercafe, he said he would have been looking again and getting on a boat.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:06:43.38" data-timestamp="403.38">Yeah. If I had not won this green card lottery, that was one of my options. I was not afraid to do that. I'm looking for a life. And to get to that, I'll keep trying to the death.</p><p begin="00:07:00.62" data-timestamp="420.62"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:03.90" data-timestamp="423.9">The thing about the lottery though, what Abdi learned, is that it does not guarantee you a life in America. In fact, it's just the first step. After you win you have to wait more than a year, then you show up at an American embassy for an interview, and you have to gather all kinds of paperwork to bring with you, medical documents and school transcripts and a criminal background check. Everything has to be perfect. Every "i" dotted. The tiniest mistake means that you can be denied for good.</p><p begin="00:07:27.81" data-timestamp="447.81">In fact, most years, over half the people who win the lottery never get their visas. They don't make it to America. And right away, after winning the lottery, Abdi got a bad break. The police in Nairobi, Kenya, where he lived, started raiding houses, looking around up all the Somalis like him and kick them out of the country. We have a very unusual day-by-day record of what happened to Abdi because a BBC reporter named Leo Hornak wanted to document this process and started calling Abdi every night. This is one of their very first recordings.</p><p begin="00:08:01.81" data-timestamp="481.81">[DIALING]</p><p begin="00:08:05.23" data-timestamp="485.23"></p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:08:08.17" data-timestamp="488.17">Hey, Abdi, can you hear me?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:08:10.30" data-timestamp="490.3">Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can hear you.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:08:11.77" data-timestamp="491.77">Are you safe right now, for the moment?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:08:14.70" data-timestamp="494.7">Yeah. I'm safe.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:08:16.68" data-timestamp="496.68">You sent me an email that had me really worried today. Tell me what happened.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:08:21.60" data-timestamp="501.6">Yeah, it was crazy. I was actually chatting with some of the people in our apartment when these guys-- we don't call them the police. We called them the guys. Out of nowhere they appeared there at the gate, and they asked us all to raise our hands up. And [SIGH] you know, we-- we were thinking, like, OK. This is the end of it. We're going to go there tonight.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:49.45" data-timestamp="529.45">By "there," he means a place called Kasarani, a giant soccer stadium that Kenyan authorities and police were using as a makeshift jail to hold hundreds of refugees.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:08:59.03" data-timestamp="539.03">Like, oh my God. The next few, couple of nights you're going to be spending there in the concentration camp, and then they take you to Mogadishu. And, OK, you're going to miss your lottery. All those things were going through my mind.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:15.24" data-timestamp="555.24">This call happened on April 17th, 2014. Abdi had 96 days to go before his interview at the US embassy, which would be scheduled for July 22nd. Leo started calling him every day. He was worried for him. Like I say, over half the people who win the lottery never make it to the United States. Would Abdi succeed?</p><p begin="00:09:34.25" data-timestamp="574.25">Over the next three months he faced a horrifying obstacle course. It's just like one seemingly impossible task after another. At several points he's afraid for his life. Today we bring you the story of one of the many people around the world who are desperately trying to make it to America, to become one of us. Will Abdi do it? Stay with us.</p><p begin="00:09:56.12" data-timestamp="596.12"></p></div>  </div>

  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:02.96" data-timestamp="602.96">OK, so you remember where we are. Abdi is about to be taken into custody by the police. Here's Leo Hornak.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:10:10.65" data-timestamp="610.65">So here's why the police were raiding Abdi's neighborhood in Nairobi. Al-Shabaab was the very group Abdi moved to Kenya to escape, have been ramping up terrorist attacks inside Kenya. You may remember one of the biggest ones.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reporter</h4><p begin="00:10:23.25" data-timestamp="623.25">The hostage crisis in the upscale Westgate Mall is ongoing. The chaotic scene now a tense standoff. ABC's--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:10:30.11" data-timestamp="630.11">In September 2013, al-Shabaab gunmen trapped hundreds of people in a mall for days, and killed 67. The way the Kenyan government responded to these terrorist attacks was the way governments often do in these situations, with a huge crackdown on the community they hold responsible. Al-Shabaab's from Somalia, so they go after Somali refugees living in Kenya.</p><p begin="00:10:52.03" data-timestamp="652.03">Government's trying to clear them out of Kenya's cities and move them to camps in the country or deport them back to Somalia. And in Nairobi the neighborhood they target is Abdi's neighborhood. It's called Eastleigh. It's a dense neighborhood where many poor Somalis live, and where there is some al-Shabaab support. Eastleigh's been there for decades. It's known as Little Mogadishu. Abdi lives there with his older brother Hassan in a small room with one bed and a single bathroom for the whole building.</p><p begin="00:11:21.06" data-timestamp="681.06">So back to that phone call on April 17th. The police show up and grab Abdi by the shirt.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:11:27.51" data-timestamp="687.51">They just get your collar and hold it so tight. And they tell you, come with me and just get into the truck. That's what they said to all of us.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:11:34.54" data-timestamp="694.54">It's 96 days until Abdi's interview, and Abdi's worried they're going to throw him and his brother into a truck and take them into detention before he can ever get his papers together and leave for America.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:11:44.93" data-timestamp="704.93">They threaten you and they try to forcibly take you to the tracks. We were not going with them. We were saying, OK, let's negotiate. I'm not going anywhere. I have legitimate documents. And they were telling us, OK, bring out all your documents. What do you have?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:11:58.95" data-timestamp="718.95">Abdi pulls out his refugee ID. Officially, that should protect Abdi. It's from the United Nations. Unofficially--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:12:06.84" data-timestamp="726.84">He didn't even try to give it single glance, because he knows the shape. He knows the frame of it. And he says-- he threw it into my face and he says, "you're a refugee? What are you doing here?" And they were like, "Come on, give us whatever you have." That's what one of them said.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:12:21.62" data-timestamp="741.62">So that's when the real business starts.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:12:24.18" data-timestamp="744.18">Yeah, when the real business starts.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:12:26.35" data-timestamp="746.35">AKA, the bribes. Abdi, his brother, and the neighbors start pooling their cash.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:12:31.38" data-timestamp="751.38">In total, I think we gave them more than 80 US dollars. And I had to beg them. Please, I have nothing. That's all I have in life. Nothing. I have nothing. This is all I have. Please, you have to take it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:12:42.60" data-timestamp="762.6">And how much does 80 US dollars buy you in Eastleigh.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:12:46.65" data-timestamp="766.65">It gives you the best food. It's better jeans, better shirts, jacket, all that stuff. It's a lot of money. It's, indeed, a lot of money.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:12:56.67" data-timestamp="776.67">And, Abdi, what happens next? I mean, there's no solution, right, to this? This could happen again tomorrow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:13:04.11" data-timestamp="784.11">Not even tomorrow. It can happen right now. It can happen to tonight. It can happen in the next few minutes. It can happen in the next few hours.</p><p begin="00:13:13.41" data-timestamp="793.41"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:13:16.20" data-timestamp="796.2">Talking to Abdi every day, what I realized was how relentless it is. Every night's another excuse for a crackdown, and the Somalis are sitting ducks, trapped in this one neighborhood.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:13:26.59" data-timestamp="806.59">Most people are indoors today. They're not going to anywhere. They're not coming out of their houses.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:13:31.53" data-timestamp="811.53">April 25th, 88 days to Abdi's interview, and counting. It's a Friday, which normally would be a busy day in Eastleigh because it's a Muslim holy day. People take off from work, go shopping, go out to eat, to meet at the mosque for prayers. But not today. Abdi says last week the police showed up at a nearby mosque, grabbed people as they left prayers, and drove them away in trucks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:13:54.36" data-timestamp="834.36">We're getting additional threats from the police saying that they will intensify the operations and that they will take more people.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:14:04.84" data-timestamp="844.84">So, Abdi, what do you think you're going to do today? Will you visit a mosque?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:14:09.84" data-timestamp="849.84">No, I will not. I never missed a prayer on Friday, but this one-- but this one. Never missed. But you never know.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:14:22.49" data-timestamp="862.49">Soon, Abdi stops leaving his apartment for anything. He and his brother, Hassan, essentially go into hiding, lockdown in their building. They stop going to school. As the days go by, food begins to run short. Abdi and Hassan pool their supplies with another Somali family on the ground floor of their building, two women, one a single mother with two small boys. But it's not much.</p><p begin="00:14:45.74" data-timestamp="885.74">Soon they're down to just tea and sugar, and a loaf of bread they're able to get each day from a Kenyan guy who delivers it on his bike. That's what they were living on. Tea and bread.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:14:56.00" data-timestamp="896">Our eyes are turning red and the energy's running out. We're looking, like, pretty skinny.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:15:02.38" data-timestamp="902.38">Abdi and Hassan are paying for the tea and bread with money they get from overseas. Years ago Abdi did some reports for an American public radio show called <i>The</i> <i>Story</i>, and a listener reached out wanting to help. She sends them money, not too different from lots of Somali refugees who have family members abroad supporting them. But, obviously, that kind of help only goes so far.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hassan Nor</h4><p begin="00:15:23.96" data-timestamp="923.96">It's challenging because, you know, you can't even shut your eyes at night and sleep soundly.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:15:29.99" data-timestamp="929.99">This is Abdi's older brother, Hassan. He tells me they aren't sleeping. He and Abdi sound the same, by the way. Apparently even their father can't tell them apart on the phone.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hassan Nor</h4><p begin="00:15:38.76" data-timestamp="938.76">Any minute you expect someone breaking into your house or grabbing you. It's like sleeping with your pants on, you know? You are always ready. You don't know what's happening, you know?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:15:52.32" data-timestamp="952.32">Yeah. Wow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hassan Nor</h4><p begin="00:15:52.76" data-timestamp="952.76">Feeling at home is like you relax, you watch a movie, something like-- that never happens. If you hear another sound outside or some other knocking or, you know, a small kind of sound-- what was it? What's happening? Are they coming? We are not criminals, just refugees. And I never thought being a refugee will make you sound like criminal.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:16:15.22" data-timestamp="975.22">The kind of police abuses Abdi told me about are well-documented by human rights groups and journalists-- arbitrary arrest, extortion, beatings, forcible deportation, family members separated. It's illegal under international law to send refugees back to a country where their lives could be in danger. The spokesman for Kenya's Ministry of Interior, which oversaw the police raids in Eastleigh, told me they were justified to make the city safe from al-Shabaab. But he confirmed that the kind of police corruption Abdi told me about has been a problem for a long time in Kenya. That is a fact, he said. We're not denying that.</p><p begin="00:16:54.19" data-timestamp="1014.19"></p><p begin="00:16:57.98" data-timestamp="1017.98">Abdi and Hassan tell me Eastleigh's come up with a warning system. The first person to spot the police from his window fires a group text to his friends to say, they're coming your way, so you've got time to hide. Then you pass the message on to your friends, and so on. You can tell a raid's started, Hassan says, when you hear all the phones going off.</p><p begin="00:17:19.07" data-timestamp="1039.07">With just three months left until his interview, Abdi still needs to get all the documents required by the US embassy, documents from the police, his school, his doctors. But he can't do any of that because he can't even leave his building. The clock's ticking.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:17:33.15" data-timestamp="1053.15">This is a long dream. My hopes were high to get this thing.

I'm feeling like, OK, you're not going to make it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:18:05.00" data-timestamp="1085">April 28th, t-minus 85 days until his interview. Instead of hiding from the police, people are now surrendering. From his window Abdi sees entire families sitting on the sidewalk with their belongings.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:18:18.47" data-timestamp="1098.47">Hundreds of families are on the move back to Somalia, are ready to show themselves to the police and say, all right, I'm done.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:18:26.41" data-timestamp="1106.41">I'm done. They don't have any more money to pay off the police. And rather than end up at the football stadium, they'll just go back to Somalia. Even the family on the ground floor, the two women with the young boys, are packing up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:18:40.44" data-timestamp="1120.44">Which really broke the heart of my brother and I because that means we're going to be alone here.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:18:47.41" data-timestamp="1127.41">Did you have any conversations with them about their plans, what they're afraid of? Can you tell me about any conversation you had with any member of that family?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:18:56.07" data-timestamp="1136.07">What they are telling me, Abdi, what are you doing here? Come on, move. You're dreaming about America. That doesn't exist. This is a dream. Come on, boy. You are wrong. That's what they're me, Leo. At some point I'm thinking, like, would it be OK to go with them? This is totally no life.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:19:11.07" data-timestamp="1151.07">I guess it can't be safe for two unaccompanied women with small children to be traveling by car from Nairobi to Somalia. It can't be safe, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:19:21.73" data-timestamp="1161.73">They're expecting everything. They're expecting an extortion of property, they are expecting a rape. Because there are gangs on the road that can rape women, and the gangs know that there are Somalis on the move. So they're somewhere on the road where there's no police in sight, so they can come and jump into buses, rape women, take their money.</p><p begin="00:19:45.11" data-timestamp="1185.11">And, you know, the other thing that these families are fearing when they reach a border between Kenya and Somalia, another chapter of danger begins because it's al-Shabaab that are lurking around the border. And when you fall into the hands of al-Shabaab, you disappear forever.</p><p begin="00:20:05.01" data-timestamp="1205.01">The other thing that I was also discussing with them about this seven-year-old and a five-year-old kid is because these are the age that the al-Shabaab-- they really want to program the kids and teach them, you know, whatever ideologies they believe. And so, yeah. The lady looked like she was so much worried for her kids than for herself. Knowing this, these two ladies and the kids must go.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:20:28.86" data-timestamp="1228.86">Wow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:20:29.66" data-timestamp="1229.66">It's really. So you have got a lot of things to think about. A lot of things to worry about.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:20:41.51" data-timestamp="1241.51">One night, on the phone, Abdi asked me if I'm familiar with the migration of the wildebeest. Abdi wants to be clear. He doesn't know about this because he's African. He's a city kid. He's just seen it on Discovery Channel clips, like everyone else. Anyway, each year thousands and thousands of wildebeest trek to a river that they have to cross in order to graze on the other side. The river's infested with crocodiles, and not every wildebeest makes it, but they all have to try.</p><p begin="00:21:08.65" data-timestamp="1268.65">Abdi says he knows how they feel. Somalis are prey, he says. They're being hunted.</p><p begin="00:21:16.23" data-timestamp="1276.23"></p><p begin="00:21:18.22" data-timestamp="1278.22">Each evening, when I phoned Abdi, I was always concerned that one night no one would answer, that he would have finally taken the advice of his neighbors or been hauled off to the holding pens in Kasarani. When he did pick up, often he wanted to talk about things that weren't related to the Kenyan police or al-Shabaab. We talked about his favorite movies, <i>Rambo</i>, that movie <i>The</i> <i>Rock</i> with Nicolas Cage, anything Schwarzenegger. We talked about his friends in the good old days in Eastleigh, when he could sit in a cafe and sip tea with camel milk.</p><p begin="00:21:48.65" data-timestamp="1308.65">One thing I asked Abdi about-- when people win the regular lottery you always hear stories about how all of a sudden family members are really nice to them, or cousins they haven't spoken to in years start calling to say hi, asking for favors. I wondered if this was the case with Abdi. Here he was sitting in a slum with all these refugees who were in the same terrible situation, and now he had a ticket out. Did people start treating him differently?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:22:15.25" data-timestamp="1335.25">Yes, Leo, especially the girls.</p><p begin="00:22:17.21" data-timestamp="1337.21">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:22:18.18" data-timestamp="1338.18">This is a very good question.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:22:20.26" data-timestamp="1340.26">Abdi is a practicing Muslim, and so were the women he hangs out with. So normally, before, you could only visit them in a kind of formal courtship visit at their home. No having girls over to his place, now hanging out in public.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:22:33.60" data-timestamp="1353.6">The difference now, since I won the green card lottery, is that they are trying to come to my house.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:22:38.29" data-timestamp="1358.29">He's talking about before the police raids started, when life was relatively normal in Eastleigh.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:22:43.94" data-timestamp="1363.94">So I just hear someone coming up the stairs and knocking at my door, and saying, hey, Abdi, how have you been? And it's a lady. And, yeah, she sits right next to your bed and it's all about the conversation. She's trying to do anything to attract you with the sweet words.</p><p begin="00:23:00.29" data-timestamp="1380.29">Do you have a girlfriend? When do you want to marry? What type of girls do you want? Now you're going to America, you need a wife. When you go to America, please let me be the first person you get in touch. Because I'm here, and I don't have a husband.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:23:14.22" data-timestamp="1394.22">Are you thinking about any of these girls?

She's really beautiful, cute. She's Somali, but she has finished high school in Nairobi. The good thing about her is that she speaks English.</p><p begin="00:23:36.06" data-timestamp="1416.06">She is really, I think, my type. She likes to read a lot, you know? She has a different character. The rest of Somali girls are very shy, but this pretty girl-- she gives me all this confidence, you know? And she allows me to go to her, and she allows me to hang out with her in downtown Nairobi wherever possible, you know? So I-- yeah. I think I fall in love.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:24:03.72" data-timestamp="1443.72">Well, congratulations. That's one piece of good news.</p><p begin="00:24:06.35" data-timestamp="1446.35">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:24:07.45" data-timestamp="1447.45">Yeah.

Abdi cautiously ventures out of the apartment building for the first time in weeks. He heads downtown to central Nairobi, where life is continuing as normal. It's a stressful journey, but he's able to buy a couple of gallons of clean water and some cans of beans to bring home. He says it's amazing how good these taste to him and Hassan. He tells me he's getting more and more worried about the paperwork he still has to get together for his interview, his medical records and transcripts from his university. And there's one piece of paper that terrifies him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:24:59.63" data-timestamp="1499.63">One of the US embassy requirements is to get a police certificate, something called a certificate of good conduct.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:25:07.12" data-timestamp="1507.12">What this basically is, is proof from Kenyan law enforcement that Abdi isn't a criminal. Abdi doesn't have a record, so this shouldn't be a big deal, except for the place he has to go to get the official certificate, the headquarters of the Kenyan police.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:25:21.19" data-timestamp="1521.19">So that scares you a lot. Thousands of Somalis are being held as we speak, and they're waiting for their return to Somalia, or some of them are waiting for their return to the camps. So when I am thinking of jumping into a bus and headed to headquarters, stepping in there and saying, hey guys, I need a police letter, my heart is already pounding.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:25:43.06" data-timestamp="1543.06">For weeks Abdi had been talking to me about this, telling me about how worried he was about having to go into the belly of the beast. Finally, on a Tuesday morning in May, 77 days before his interview, he gets up early, gets together every idea he has to prove he's a legal refugee, says goodbye to Hassan, and takes a bus to police headquarters. He walks in, waits for his name to be called, and walks up to the window where he faces a Kenyan police officer. And what he encounters is not brutal police tactics, but bureaucracy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:26:15.18" data-timestamp="1575.18">He was telling me, there's nothing that I can do but take your paper and send it to UNHCR, and then I have to wait for them to come back to me. Even it can take more than five months, he tells me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:26:24.36" data-timestamp="1584.36">Five months. Way too long for Abdi to have it in time for his interview on July 22nd.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:26:29.34" data-timestamp="1589.34">The guy there was not friendly. He was really, really fierce, and I was frozen with fear. And finally, I tell him, wait, just listen to me, gentlemen. You're talking about five months, sir, but that's not what I'm talking about. If I don't get this police certificate, they will not give me-- or issue a visa for me, all right? So please, is it possible? And he was telling me, there's nothing that I can do for you. It's going to take more than five months.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:26:56.44" data-timestamp="1616.44">There's no possibility of you going into a later position with the US embassy, is there?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:27:02.20" data-timestamp="1622.2">No.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:27:02.46" data-timestamp="1622.46">No.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:27:02.77" data-timestamp="1622.77">It doesn't happen.

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:27:50.05" data-timestamp="1670.05">It's <i>This American Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Today on our program we're hearing the story of Abdi Nor, a Somali refugee who escaped to Kenya. And then he won what amounts to a golden ticket to move to the United States and become an American, but only if he's able to make it to an interview at the US embassy, with all the right paperwork, all done perfectly, so he can cash in that golden ticket.</p><p begin="00:28:11.02" data-timestamp="1691.02">The United Nations has reported that the number of people around the world displaced from their homes because of conflict and persecution is at an all time high. It's over 65 million people, the largest number the UN has ever recorded. Abdi, of course, is one of those people.</p><p begin="00:28:25.23" data-timestamp="1705.23">He's Muslim, from a country with a proven history of terrorism. There are proposals, of course, in this presidential race to ban Muslims or people from countries like that from emigrating to the United States, even if, like Abdi, they are running from terrorists and aren't terrorists themselves. Anyway, Leo Hornick continues this story.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:28:44.08" data-timestamp="1724.08">May 12th, t-minus 71 days to Abdi's embassy interview. Abdi gets on a bus home from school, and this time runs into another danger. Not the police, not al-Shabaab themselves, but the fear of al-Shabaab.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:28:58.24" data-timestamp="1738.24">The bus is so crowded with people. And there are these two ladies watching me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:29:04.01" data-timestamp="1744.01">Abdi looks around and realizes he's the only Somali. People can tell. Somalis look different.

They're thinking, like, when is this guy putting his hand into that bag and start to blow up? These ladies then started shouting at the driver, have you made sure there's no bomb in that bag?</p><p begin="00:29:32.60" data-timestamp="1772.6"></p><p begin="00:29:37.37" data-timestamp="1777.37">I had to fight back. And I say, listen lady, wait a minute. I'm not what you think I am, you know? No. There's no bomb in here. I'm not one of those people. I'm a student and I'm carrying my books. It's quite embarrassing. And at the same time, I feel fear because everyone in there had very cautious eyes on me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:30:02.47" data-timestamp="1802.47">In Kenya, because people don't trust the police, mobs will take justice into their own hands. For example, if a shopkeeper yells "thief" on the street, strangers might grab the person and beat them. And it's not unheard of for people to die this way.</p><p begin="00:30:16.45" data-timestamp="1816.45">A man in the back of the past chimes in. "Why is he there," he shouts. Kick him out."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:30:21.59" data-timestamp="1821.59">I tried as much as I can to calm them down, and they were ignoring me. And then the driver turns his head and tells me, boy, step out of my car or I'll call the police. And you know, we weren't in little Mogadishu. We weren't in downtown. We were in the middle. And in the middle, what I mean in the middle, is exactly the Pangani police station.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:30:47.59" data-timestamp="1847.59">This is the police station Somali terrorist bombed two weeks earlier.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:30:51.19" data-timestamp="1851.19">What do you think? If they kick me out there with a bag, standing there near the police station, what's going to happen? They can shoot me to death. I said to the driver, wait a minute. You want to know what's in here? And then I had to unzip my bag and bring everything out, the books, the papers, showed him the pen, the student ID. Everything I brought out.</p><p begin="00:31:11.48" data-timestamp="1871.48">And then I hang the bag upside-down and showed him. Do you see anything in there?

[LAUGHS] I'm an American citizen.</p><p begin="00:55:00.79" data-timestamp="3300.79"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:55:08.60" data-timestamp="3308.6">There was one thing about the approval of Abdi's visa that made us wonder. The day Abdi's visa was issued, before he heard the news, I had actually called the US embassy in Nairobi. I said I was a reporter doing a story about Abdi, and that I was curious about how long their decision would take because of my deadline. The woman I spoke to said she didn't know.</p><p begin="00:55:31.49" data-timestamp="3331.49">For nine days, Abdi hadn't heard anything. Two hours after my call, he got the good news. We asked the State Department if my phone call influenced their decision about Abdi's visa, and they told us, quote, "the journalist's call played no role in the timing of the visa issuance. Any visa process coinciding with a press inquiry is merely a coincidence."</p><p begin="00:55:53.95" data-timestamp="3353.95">I can't prove anything, but that is at odds with what the woman on the phone told me back when I initially called the embassy. She said that now that they knew I was doing a story about Abdi, they would try and expedite the process, even though I told her that wasn't why I was calling, and that I was only asking for information.</p><p begin="00:56:11.46" data-timestamp="3371.46">We spoke with eight immigration lawyers, all experienced with the diversity visa lottery, and they all said my call probably bumped Abdi's application to the top of the pile that day. And with the lottery, because they give out a finite number of visas by a hard deadline, that can be the difference between making it to the US or not.</p><p begin="00:56:33.39" data-timestamp="3393.39"></p><p begin="00:56:37.66" data-timestamp="3397.66">On August 11th, 2014, Hassan took Abdi to Nairobi airport. Abdi's now living in a small town in Maine. The woman who had been supporting him is putting him up with her family. About a month in, I give him a call.</p><p begin="00:56:52.83" data-timestamp="3412.83">[PHONE RINGING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:56:56.65" data-timestamp="3416.65">Yes, Leo.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:56:57.21" data-timestamp="3417.21">Hi, Abdi. How is it going? Good to hear from you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:57:00.45" data-timestamp="3420.45">It's going incredibly good.

Do you know where the postbox is?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:57:12.30" data-timestamp="3432.3">He's saying postbox. Mailbox.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:57:14.97" data-timestamp="3434.97">It's on the opposite side of the road, Leo. Can you believe that?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:57:18.44" data-timestamp="3438.44">Abdi says he's expecting his social security card and green card in the mail.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:57:22.33" data-timestamp="3442.33">Are you telling me that everything will be delivered into that little box? Anybody can grab it?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:57:27.51" data-timestamp="3447.51">The idea that a United States green card could sit in an unlocked mailbox on a public road blew his mind.</p><p begin="00:57:37.06" data-timestamp="3457.06"></p><p begin="00:57:39.05" data-timestamp="3459.05">That was 10 months ago. Abdi spent the winter installing insulation on roofs around Maine. He really wants to apply for college, but it's hard because he sends a lot of his money back home. Hassan's now married, still in university, still living in Eastleigh.</p><p begin="00:57:56.57" data-timestamp="3476.57">Abdi keeps in touch with the woman he was seeing back in Nairobi. She's still asking him to bring her to the US and marry her, but he's not sure he wants to do that. One time Abdi asked her straight up if she'd be into him if he didn't have a green card, and she was honest. She said no, which Abdi appreciated. He knows Somali women don't have a lot of options for leaving Eastleigh.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:58:18.62" data-timestamp="3498.62">Part of me is still in Nairobi. It's still in Eastleigh. My brother's there, my friends are there.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:58:23.80" data-timestamp="3503.8">Abdi says since he left his friends have this new ritual. When they go to the tea shop they all used to hang out at, which is just some tables and chairs a woman sets up on the street outside her building, they order an extra cup of tea for Abdi.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:58:39.32" data-timestamp="3519.32">That's what they do. And they drink it for me. Like, if they are two or three people, they just take sips, sending me a photo of the tea and telling me, that's your tea. And then, the next picture, the tea is empty. And they're like, you just drank it. So I can feel that, you know? I'm right there.</p><p begin="00:58:56.52" data-timestamp="3536.52">And then-- actually, it's sometimes amusing because I'm at the Dunkin' Donuts, drinking a coolatta, and my friend sends me a picture of the nice tea that we used to have at the tea shop, and then I send him a picture of the coolatta that I'm drinking.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:59:13.64" data-timestamp="3553.64">So it's kind of like you guys are still going to the same tea shop. It's just, one of them is a Dunkin' Donuts in Maine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abdi Nor</h4><p begin="00:59:20.61" data-timestamp="3560.61">That's actually right.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Leo Hornak</h4><p begin="00:59:23.29" data-timestamp="3563.29">Sometimes, he says, the Kenyan police walk in and the next photo is an empty tea shop, empty chairs, half-full cups, everyone gone. Meanwhile, at the Dunkin' Donuts, sometimes cops walk in and say hi to him, or good morning. It's amazing, he says.</p><p begin="00:59:42.94" data-timestamp="3582.94"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:59:46.67" data-timestamp="3586.67">Leo Hornak with the BBC.
