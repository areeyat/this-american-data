  <h3>Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.75" data-timestamp="0.75">When you visit a refugee camp full of Muslims, you don't expect to get into a lot of conversations about pigs, but that's what happened to me. This is about a month ago. I'd barely been in the refugee camp a few hours before people started telling me stories.</p><p begin="00:00:12.02" data-timestamp="12.02">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:00:13.78" data-timestamp="13.78"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:00:15.36" data-timestamp="15.36">We've seen the pig with our own eyes. We've seen the boar. We've taken pictures of videos of it, videos of it.</p><p begin="00:00:20.14" data-timestamp="20.14">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:00:20.83" data-timestamp="20.83">We've taken a selfie with it. Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:24.00" data-timestamp="24">Bassam and Farhad are 19. That's an interpreter, by the way, speaking English. This  is a refugee camp in Greece called Ritsona, about an hour from Athens. It was thrown together in March by the government on an old air force base. Very quickly, they set up tents for 700 people, brought in a few dozen port-a-potties, designated an old helicopter pad as the soccer field. But it's the middle of the woods, so snakes get in the tents, and at night, wild boars do roam around. Everybody's attitude about the boars was like, seriously? We escaped a war, risked dying on these tiny boats, and now we come here and this?</p><p begin="00:00:59.41" data-timestamp="59.41">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:01:00.81" data-timestamp="60.81">It is a huge boar. It's basically as big as we are. It's this big.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:05.29" data-timestamp="65.29">OK, so this is a video. Oh look. There it is.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:01:09.32" data-timestamp="69.32">Yes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:10.61" data-timestamp="70.61">The boars especially hang out near the toilets, and they are really big and frightening. And some people just hold it in all night rather than go. Other people, they're taking action.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mimi Karmiri</h4><p begin="00:01:21.93" data-timestamp="81.93">Over there. You see? This is a handmade trap.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:25.96" data-timestamp="85.96">Mimi Karmiri was the field coordinator running the camp, and she walked me out in the woods with one of the refugees, Abu Khair, to show me the trap that he'd built to catch the boars. It wasn't what I pictured. And what is it, a dumpster?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mimi Karmiri</h4><p begin="00:01:41.87" data-timestamp="101.87">Yes, it's a dumpster. And so he has put a piece of meat inside in order to attract the animals.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:50.01" data-timestamp="110.01">The dumpster's turned on its side, and the lid was propped open with a log so a boar could just walk right in.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abu Khair</h4><p begin="00:01:55.84" data-timestamp="115.84">This open. That food to animals.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:59.19" data-timestamp="119.19">Abu Khair grabs the lid.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abu Khair</h4><p begin="00:02:00.54" data-timestamp="120.54">If animals catch food, this closes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:05.32" data-timestamp="125.32">So basically the lid closes, and then the log comes down and holds it shut.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abu Khair</h4><p begin="00:02:10.24" data-timestamp="130.24">And this thing.</p><p begin="00:02:12.14" data-timestamp="132.14">[CLAPPING]</p><p begin="00:02:13.51" data-timestamp="133.51"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:14.43" data-timestamp="134.43">He claps his hands. I didn't say anything, but it did not seem at all clear that that lid was going to stay on with an angry, 200 pound pig inside. Before I got to Greece, I knew that there were lots of refugees there, fleeing violence from Syria, and Iraq, and Afghanistan, just like everybody had seen those photos last year of people landing in Greece by boat on their way to Germany and other European countries. Then this year, in March, one of the European nations said basically, "We're not taking you. You have to stay in Greece," to all these refugees.</p><p begin="00:02:43.92" data-timestamp="163.92">Suddenly, the poorest country in Western Europe had to figure out how to house, and feed, and care for all these people, about 57,000 of them, stuck. And Greece was really not prepared. Its government was limping along after six years of austerity measures, which means, if you haven't been following this, there have been several waves of cutbacks in government services. A fourth of the country is out of work.</p><p begin="00:03:05.82" data-timestamp="185.82">The government quickly ad hocced its way into housing for tens of thousands of people. And as a result, you have this camp in the woods with wild boars. And 130 miles away on the coast, some Syrian refugees were living in an abandoned beach resort on the Ionian Sea.</p><p begin="00:03:20.88" data-timestamp="200.88">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:03:23.58" data-timestamp="203.58">Kids play in the sand, and modestly dressed women in long sleeves, and long pants, and headscarves walk straight into the surf. Elsewhere around the country, if you want to come with me right now on a quick tour, around 1,300 Iraqis are housed in the grounds of a former psychiatric hospital near Mount Olympus. Down in Athens, 2,000 people are in two stadiums, baseball and field hockey, left over from the 2004 Olympic games.</p><p begin="00:03:49.10" data-timestamp="229.1">Somebody has spray painted a sign outside that says, in English, with arrows, "hockey, baseball, refugees." Next door to the stadiums, 1,000 people are living in an old international airport that closed back in 2001. There are departure boards, listing flights to Paris and Berlin with specific times and gates, from when it was still a functioning airport. Right nearby, the people sleeping in tents weren't going anywhere.</p><p begin="00:04:12.95" data-timestamp="252.95">Meanwhile, up north, near the Macedonian border, my colleague, <i>This American Life</i> producer Sean Cole, visited a highway rest stop that is pretty much exactly like any rest stop you would find on, like, the New Jersey turnpike or I-80 driving to Chicago. Inside, there's a convenience store with Pringles, and Oreos, and sodas. And then outside, where the gas pumps are, were pop tents with 2,000 people living in them, music playing.</p><p begin="00:04:35.58" data-timestamp="275.58">People sat around the gas pumps, chatting and smoking right there, which probably not the best idea. An eight-year-old boy walked up to Sean and his interpreter Manaf with a request.</p><p begin="00:04:45.65" data-timestamp="285.65">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:04:47.43" data-timestamp="287.43"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Manaf</h4><p begin="00:04:48.41" data-timestamp="288.41">Yes, I would like to take your passport.</p><p begin="00:04:51.28" data-timestamp="291.28">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:04:52.45" data-timestamp="292.45">To go to Germany.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:04:54.05" data-timestamp="294.05">So you would pose as me?</p><p begin="00:04:56.67" data-timestamp="296.67">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:04:57.49" data-timestamp="297.49"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Manaf</h4><p begin="00:05:00.89" data-timestamp="300.89">I will get the same haircut.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:05:02.76" data-timestamp="302.76">I think they would still be able to tell the difference.</p><p begin="00:05:05.61" data-timestamp="305.61">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:05:06.47" data-timestamp="306.47"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Manaf</h4><p begin="00:05:08.30" data-timestamp="308.3">Would you make a passport for me, then?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:05:10.35" data-timestamp="310.35">I could maybe draw one.</p><p begin="00:05:12.18" data-timestamp="312.18">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:05:13.51" data-timestamp="313.51">What do you think about this place?</p><p begin="00:05:15.46" data-timestamp="315.46">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:05:16.38" data-timestamp="316.38"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Manaf</h4><p begin="00:05:20.77" data-timestamp="320.77">It's not beautiful.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:23.70" data-timestamp="323.7">This gas station camp, by the way, was not an official refugee camp set up by the state. In fact, just a few days after Sean was there, the government relocated everybody to authorized camps. To give you a sense of just how seat-of-the-pants the Greek response to the refugee crisis has been, I talked to this guy who managed a camp of about 2,000 refugees when he was there. His name is Sakis Papithemilis. He's a civil servant. He chooses his words thoughtfully. And who, by the way, has his own salary cut in half over the last four years.</p><p begin="00:05:51.28" data-timestamp="351.28">NPR'S reporter in Greece, Joanna Kakissis, introduced me to him. She guided, actually, a lot of the reporting that we did around Greece. Sakis told Joanna and me that even trying to do something straightforward in the camp that he managed, like, for example, arrange for trash pickup, he would run into an incredibly basic problem.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sakis Papithemilis</h4><p begin="00:06:09.58" data-timestamp="369.58">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p><p begin="00:06:12.06" data-timestamp="372.06"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:06:13.05" data-timestamp="373.05">With the trash, for example, I couldn't organize the trash being picked up, because legally the camp didn't exist. The camp just wasn't there on paper.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:20.98" data-timestamp="380.98">Got that? The camps were created so quickly that nobody made them into any kind of legal entity. They weren't a business. They weren't a government agency. So they didn't have the power to actually sign any kind of contract with anyone to do anything.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sakis Papithemilis</h4><p begin="00:06:34.52" data-timestamp="394.52">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:06:36.75" data-timestamp="396.75">And everything had to be done with a handshake. OK, you want to help me?

And they paid for it too, just 'cause he needed the help. And then he had to work around this same exact frustrating problem to get anything done. To get food brought in, to install proper sewage, to install proper showers and toilets, just anything, he couldn't make a legal agreement. He had to go off the books.</p><p begin="00:07:16.09" data-timestamp="436.09">Four of us from our staff traveled to Greece. We were joined by Joanna, who's been reporting on this and breaking stories on the refugee crisis for two years now. We were interested in how the Greek government was dealing with the refugees, but honestly, we also wanted to know what it was like for all these people who, you know, they thought they were heading somewhere else in Europe, and now they were stuck in these camps, in this weird kind of limbo, where they're just waiting for some country to let them in, and they can restart their lives. It's just a strange place to find yourself.</p><p begin="00:07:46.33" data-timestamp="466.33">Outside the old international airport, by a hot dog stand just across the highway from the beach, which is there also, Marzia and her husband Jamal and their three kids are living in a little tent. It's really hot, and every day, a fancy green convertible Saab parks outside their tent. And every day, Marzia goes and sits in the shade of that car to cool herself off.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marzia</h4><p begin="00:08:09.31" data-timestamp="489.31">[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p><p begin="00:08:11.24" data-timestamp="491.24"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:14.50" data-timestamp="494.5">She's saying, sometimes its get so crazy.

She and her husband Jamal talk to another <i>This American Life</i> producer, Miki Meek. They're ethnic Hazaras, who are discriminated against in Afghanistan, where they're from, and also targeted by the Taliban. So they moved to Iran for a while, where they have no rights at all. Couldn't even put their kids in school. And then they ended up here five months ago, where Jamal is getting used to his wife basically freaking out every single day, and telling him they need to give up and go back.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:09:00.97" data-timestamp="540.97">Today, my wife was just crying that I had it. You gotta make a decision-- either we go back, or we move forward. And I explained to her, look, my dear. We can't go back, because there's nothing to go back to.

And it did.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:09:28.39" data-timestamp="568.39">Are you worried about move might stop working eventually?

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:13.35" data-timestamp="613.35">Act 1, Field of Interrupted Dreams. So one good place to see how the Greeks' ad hoc response is working is at the baseball stadium in Athens. About a fourth of the refugees in Greece are from Afghanistan, and about 1,000 of them were brought into this abandoned stadium that was left over from the Olympics. The infield was all dirt. One of our producers, Miki, went there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:10:33.01" data-timestamp="633.01">Here's how you turn a baseball stadium into a refugee camp. Out in the door of the infield and the outfield you set up 150 white tents. They're standard issue from the UN. At the concession stand, give out rations. Right behind home plate, there's a press box. Make that the office. For bathrooms, use the locker rooms behind the dugouts. There's one for men and one for women. The women's is way cleaner.</p><p begin="00:10:58.74" data-timestamp="658.74">We're walking to the women's area.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anna Agriteli</h4><p begin="00:11:00.38" data-timestamp="660.38">The women are very organized. They have a list. They clean the bathrooms twice a day.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:11:04.55" data-timestamp="664.55">The women?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anna Agriteli</h4><p begin="00:11:05.43" data-timestamp="665.43">Men are not better organized. We have to drag them to clean their bathroom.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:11:09.53" data-timestamp="669.53">One of the camps managers, Anna Agriteli, is giving me a tour. She has big brown hair pulled into a ponytail. She's Greek. So we're just walking into the locker room. And the floors are a little flooded, so we're just walking through a pool water. All the lockers and benches have been ripped out. And over in the showers, women are squatting with buckets full of water and clothing.</p><p begin="00:11:34.73" data-timestamp="694.73">11 showers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anna Agriteli</h4><p begin="00:11:37.03" data-timestamp="697.03">Now they're washing their clothes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:11:38.84" data-timestamp="698.84">Laundry, they're doing laundry now. So does this just get flooded just from the people doing their laundry?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anna Agriteli</h4><p begin="00:11:43.76" data-timestamp="703.76">Their laundry, yes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:11:45.51" data-timestamp="705.51">OK. I counted 12 toilets. Only six were working. This was for 300 women and about 200 girls. Did you ever go to a baseball game during the Olympics?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anna Agriteli</h4><p begin="00:11:56.53" data-timestamp="716.53">No. We are not big fans of baseball in Greece. We don't even know baseball.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:12:11.34" data-timestamp="731.34">Most of the refugees stay out of their tents during the day, because they're too hot. They're totally exposed on the field, no shade. Temperatures right now reach into the 90s. So lots of people hang out in the upper levels of the stadium seats, because they're partially covered by an overhanging roof. They also crowd around any electrical outlet they can find to charge phones or plug in electric tea pots. The Olympics were held here. I keep thinking that.</p><p begin="00:12:37.37" data-timestamp="757.37">Anna is in charge of everything in the stadium, everything-- a woman who didn't get shampoo when they handed it out, the broken toilets. The day I was there, they didn't have enough drinking water and baby formula to get through the coming week. She takes me over to homebase, where they built a prototype cover for the tents, these giant pieces of green sheer fabric stretched over a tent to try and cool it down in the sun.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anna Agriteli</h4><p begin="00:13:00.06" data-timestamp="780.06">This is sample. See if it works. But we don't like it, and we're going to change it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:13:05.15" data-timestamp="785.15">So is it not working well? Or what would you guys want?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anna Agriteli</h4><p begin="00:13:07.02" data-timestamp="787.02">No, it's very, very bad. And if you put 150 of those, then I'm not going to see the people.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:13:13.77" data-timestamp="793.77">She needs to see the people, in case there's a fire or some other disturbance. It's happened. This is Anna's third month on the job. Before this, she worked as a production assistant at a theater company.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:13:25.55" data-timestamp="805.55">Is there anything that you learned in that job that's useful in this job?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anna Agriteli</h4><p begin="00:13:30.14" data-timestamp="810.14">No. But maybe the production, the crazy hours that you work in the production, that's the same, and that you have to devise a solution for every crazy thing.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:13:40.67" data-timestamp="820.67">Situations that come up, you have to, like, work on the fly.

Somebody would describe the most awful thing that could ever happen, and then they would pull out their cell phones. Like, oh here's a picture. Here's the bombed out apartment that used to be our house. Here is an overloaded raft crossing from Turkey into Greece. That's my kids in the orange life jackets.</p><p begin="00:29:17.85" data-timestamp="1757.85">I suppose if you visit war zones all the time, this is nothing new. And of course people use cell phones for this, to record the near annihilation of their families. I would do it too. But it was always jolting.</p><p begin="00:29:36.69" data-timestamp="1776.69">The interview that I did that gave me the best picture of what it's like to be a parent in the camps and the particular ways that it affected different members of a family to be here was an interview with a woman named Aziza Bashar. She's well dressed, even here, with a stylish hijab, a red and navy plaid button down jacket, and a steamlined navy skirt. It's like, what little she can control, she does.</p><p begin="00:29:58.92" data-timestamp="1798.92">Her husband's also in the camp, though he waved me off when I tried to talk to him. She's the one who makes the decisions for the family, who marched them out of a war zone, walking and actually sometimes running she said, to a town up north where things were safer. And when things there became untenable, she moved them again to Kurdistan where they lived for a while.</p><p begin="00:30:16.81" data-timestamp="1816.81">And finally they just decided to escape to Europe. They arrived in Greece by boat, thinking they were just passing through just here for a few days. The child she worries about most of her kids is Mohammad, Hammed, they call him. He's nearly eight. When the war began, they were near Aleppo. Hammed was the child who reacted the worst to the bombing, and the snipers, and the shelling, which were constant for days sometimes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aziza Bashar</h4><p begin="00:30:38.51" data-timestamp="1838.51">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:30:40.48" data-timestamp="1840.48">But the longest we were under siege for was eight days.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aziza Bashar</h4><p begin="00:30:43.32" data-timestamp="1843.32">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:30:44.20" data-timestamp="1844.2"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:30:45.77" data-timestamp="1845.77">Meaning that the fighting was going on day and night, nonstop.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:30:49.20" data-timestamp="1849.2">Hammed was four.

Next, it was the airplanes. And that became a family project. And now he's not so scared of the planes. Though the one thing they haven't been able to fix is his dreams.

It's gonna eat me, and I'm gonna die."</p><p begin="00:32:42.61" data-timestamp="1962.61">I told him it's just a story. It's just cartoons. Don't be afraid.

It was supposed to be 35 people in a little rubber boat, but Aziza says that they packed on twice that many and didn't give out life vests. And people wanted to get off, and the smugglers pointed guns at them and said you have to go now. A few people told me stories like that.</p><p begin="00:33:20.71" data-timestamp="2000.71">They got a little ways out, and the boat started to deflate, and started to flip over, just capsized. And people screamed. It was terrifying. No life vests, remember. And Aziza's got a five-year-old, and a seven-year-old, and a nine-year-old with her. And the boat turned back.</p><p begin="00:33:37.12" data-timestamp="2017.12">OK, so after that, how in the world do you get your six kids onto a second boat? That requires some A level parenting moves, and Aziza was the one who had to get her kids onboard, literally onboard in this case. And mainly she painted a picture of the bright future they were going to have in Europe, and she pretended she knew that this new boat was going to be totally different. And they went again.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aziza Bashar</h4><p begin="00:34:01.88" data-timestamp="2041.88">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:34:04.26" data-timestamp="2044.26"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:34:04.74" data-timestamp="2044.74">Yeah, I was afraid more for my kids than for myself.

She said, he wasn't any help with that back in Syria, and here, he's totally useless. She tries to get him to handle things, but it's like he's the seventh child that she's taking care of.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aziza Bashar</h4><p begin="00:34:54.06" data-timestamp="2094.06">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:34:54.90" data-timestamp="2094.9">It's had a toll on my mental health seeing my kids and their dad.

Every family was given a standard issue tent, and they built an outer courtyard with a fence, and there's an overhang so there's shade, and there's a table, and benches, and shelves made from wood that was scavenged from old shipping pallets. And then you go through a door, and there's a kind of mud room pantry with their food, and then another room with a bed for the kids, and shelves with neatly folded children's clothes, and a row of hooks for other clothes.</p><p begin="00:36:43.27" data-timestamp="2203.27">And it's all super cheerful. Everything's covered with brightly colored fabric. And then there's another entry, and it's the parents' bedroom with a full size bed and night table.

These are the refugees whose possible immigration was a big reason that Britain pulled out of the EU, whose existence has led to the rise of xenophobic parties from Germany to Denmark. These are the Muslims we talk about blocking from our own borders.</p><p begin="00:41:00.83" data-timestamp="2460.83">Aziza says she can't go back. Her old house doesn't exist. Her whole family has left Syria. There's nothing for them there. Not long ago, Aziza was missing her own mother, and feeling really sad about that. And the kids noticed, and they told her, we're there for you. And they said, if we could do anything to make you happy, and they tried to cheer her up, and they made  little jokes, and little funny moves, which was really sweet, and she loved it.</p><p begin="00:41:23.41" data-timestamp="2483.41">And they would try to take care of her in the way that she tries to take care of them. At the same time, she felt like, oh, it's come to this? That they're taking care of her? It's like these days when she tells them, they're still going to have a bright future. They just need to hold on. She see's them nod, like they're humoring her, pretending to agree, just to make her feel better. That does not seem good to her, she said. It doesn't seem ideal at all.</p><p begin="00:41:56.37" data-timestamp="2516.37">Coming up. So for your new life to begin, all you need is for somebody to pick up the phone when you call.

  <h3>Act Three: All Our Representatives Are Currently Busy</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:40.92" data-timestamp="2560.92">We've arrived at Act 3 of our program, Act 3. All our representatives are currently busy.</p><p begin="00:42:46.96" data-timestamp="2566.96">So the first step for any refugee to leave the refugee camp limbo that they're in in Greece and get relocated elsewhere in Europe, is that they need official asylum papers from Greece. And the problem is, there are too many refugees for the government office that handles this to process quickly. And fearing a situation where just like hundreds of refugees would line up every day at their office door, the asylum office in Greece set up a way for people to make appointments for their interview and their paperwork.</p><p begin="00:43:13.53" data-timestamp="2593.53">Basically, they set up a system where people could call the office on Skype. And just a word here. If you don't know what Skype is, it's like an internet phone call, like Face Time. People have it on their phones. You can call without the video also. And the asylum office made a schedule of when people could call. So for instance, people who speak Arabic got from 10:00 to noon on Mondays and 10:00 to 11:00 on Tuesdays some weeks. Dari and Farsi speakers got an hour Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.</p><p begin="00:43:40.63" data-timestamp="2620.63">And making the appointment is important, because once you have the appointment, you get access to health care, and you get a temporary permit to stay in Greece for a year. If you don't have that, they can arrest you. One of our reporters, Miki Meek, went to watch refugees make these Skype calls in Athens. This was six weeks ago.</p><p begin="00:43:55.98" data-timestamp="2635.98">Turns out, when it comes to pre-registering for asylum, like the cops say on American TV shows, you can do it the easy way, or you can do it the hard way.

So because those Skype calls have been criticized, in the time since Miki recorded those people who were calling in, the United Nations Refugee Agency, UNHCR, has started going to camps with the Greek government to pre-register hundreds of people at a time in person, so they don't have to use Skype. And they've done tons of people this way, over 25,000 people.</p><p begin="00:58:04.95" data-timestamp="3484.95">But the problem is, these people were told when they do this, OK, you're pre-registered for asylum, but they weren't given an actual appointment. Like, they weren't given a date to come in to be interviewed and start the asylum process. An NGO staffer told us that the government tells the refugees that they'll be texted sometime in the coming year with a date. And then after that, the asylum process itself, that they're just applying for, right? That itself can take months.</p><p begin="00:58:31.67" data-timestamp="3511.67">But that's just the delay that all these people face with the local bureaucracy in Greece. The next problem they have is, although the rest of Europe has officially agreed to let in these 57,000 people into their countries, they're not doing it. Only 2,681 have been relocated out of 57,000. It's totally stalled. Apparently, the politics for any country to allow in refugees right now is too delicate to let these people in.</p><p begin="00:58:57.58" data-timestamp="3537.58">Dimitris Vitsas, who's in charge of coordinating the refugee crisis in Greece, he's the Deputy Ministry of Defense, he told me that Greece understands that these 57,000 people may not be going anywhere for a very long time. And when they finally do leave, given the situation in the world, others are probably going to show up to replace them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dimitris Vitsas</h4><p begin="00:59:16.74" data-timestamp="3556.74">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p><p begin="00:59:17.95" data-timestamp="3557.95"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:59:18.24" data-timestamp="3558.24">Our goal is to have ready over 60,000 places where we can host refugees and migrants in central Greece--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dimitris Vitsas</h4><p begin="00:59:27.69" data-timestamp="3567.69">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p><p begin="00:59:28.87" data-timestamp="3568.87"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:59:30.01" data-timestamp="3570.01">Indefinitely moving forward for the coming years.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:59:33.53" data-timestamp="3573.53">Indefinitely. Now, short term, they hope to get 2/3 of the refugees, 40,000 people, out of tents and into little trailers that they call "iso boxes," which have AC, and heat, and proper kitchens, and showers, and bathrooms. And they hope to do that by September, or anyway before winter. They have money for this provided by the rest of Europe.</p><p begin="00:59:52.12" data-timestamp="3592.12">The other roughly 20,000 refugees--</p><p begin="00:59:54.98" data-timestamp="3594.98">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p><p begin="00:59:56.76" data-timestamp="3596.76"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:59:58.87" data-timestamp="3598.87">Our goal is to have 20,000 people in houses and apartments by the end of September.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="01:00:06.52" data-timestamp="3606.52">This is not only better for the refugees than living in the camps, it's great for the Greeks, because it puts money into the hands of Greek citizens. Basically, other European countries will pay Greek property owners to fix up and rent out rooms, and apartments, and houses to the refugees. The Greeks are also hoping to set up schools for refugee children by the end of September. I did talk to officials from the International Rescue Committee and UNHCR, and they applauded these ambitions, but they were deeply skeptical that Greece would actually make the goals for such large numbers of refugees.</p><p begin="01:00:39.28" data-timestamp="3639.28">But this whole plan that Greece is preparing for tens of thousands of refugees to be there for a long, long time? The refugees don't know it. People we met in the camps really had no idea, and they're trying to move ahead with parts of their lives, whatever they can. And in fact, next week on our show, we have stories of people trying to do that, like this couple that met and fell in love, even though they were not expecting anything like that to happen to them while en route from one country to another. And even though her family did not approve and tried to keep them apart, the guy in the couple was undeterred.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="01:01:13.26" data-timestamp="3673.26">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="01:01:14.35" data-timestamp="3674.35"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="01:01:15.43" data-timestamp="3675.43">I love her very much, and those people won't stand in our way.
