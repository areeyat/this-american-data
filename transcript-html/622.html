    <div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:00:03.24" data-timestamp="3.24"> From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i></p><p begin="00:00:06.32" data-timestamp="6.32">[DIALING]</p><p begin="00:00:08.51" data-timestamp="8.51">Ira Glass is off this week. I'm Sean Cole.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pat</h4><p begin="00:00:11.37" data-timestamp="11.37"> Yo, Sean! This is your mom. I wasn't home.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:00:15.63" data-timestamp="15.63"> I'm just going to say up front that today's show deals with a device invented more than a century ago to facilitate real time voice-to-voice interaction. The kids don't use it much for that purpose anymore, but in all the stories you're going to hear, the phone's primary purpose is as a phone.</p><p begin="00:00:30.58" data-timestamp="30.58">About four or five years ago, I started saving all my mom's voicemails, thinking, she's not going to be around forever. I'm going to want to hear her voice when she's gone. Though somehow I didn't extend that thought to, "I could hear her voice right now if I picked up the phone." She had a talent for the form. With some of them, it almost feels like I'm talking to her, except she's playing both parts.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pat</h4><p begin="00:00:52.51" data-timestamp="52.51"> What time is it? Oh, it's 6:52. Yeah, it's later than I thought. I can't believe it's still light out. Decided to go to the Royal for supper tonight. So that's what we did. We went early, and we are back early. So I don't know what you're doing. So this is me, c'est moi. I'm here. Right. Yo aqui.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:01:20.68" data-timestamp="80.68"> C'est moi. It's me in French. Sometimes there's not much more than that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pat</h4><p begin="00:01:24.29" data-timestamp="84.29"> C'est moi. Love you much. Talk to you soon. Bye.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:01:27.76" data-timestamp="87.76"> This one's even shorter.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pat</h4><p begin="00:01:29.26" data-timestamp="89.26"> C'est moi. Bye.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:01:31.16" data-timestamp="91.16"> But of course all the messages boil down to her saying, in one creative way or another, "Please call me back." Sometimes she was a lot more direct about it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pat</h4><p begin="00:01:39.91" data-timestamp="99.91"> Don't forget to call your mother! Goodbye!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:01:48.91" data-timestamp="108.91"> Actually, here's the one that I always tell people about when I'm talking about her messages. It's like she sort of circles and then goes in for the kill.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pat</h4><p begin="00:01:56.94" data-timestamp="116.94"> I heard you on the radio on Sunday, and I knew it was you, because I could recognize your voice, even though it's been a long time since I've heard it on the phone. So anyway, I love you lots and lots. Call me when you think of it, if you ever do. Love you. Bye.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:02:22.45" data-timestamp="142.45"> My mom, her name was Pat. She died on September 28, 2015, At 4:22 in the morning. It was relatively sudden and totally unexpected. And as much as I thought I was preparing myself for that moment, I wasn't prepared. It's true, I didn't call enough. But she was still the first person I thought to call when something huge happened. Good or bad.</p><p begin="00:02:45.67" data-timestamp="165.67">I loved talking to her. She was funny, as you can tell. And smart. She wrote technical manuals in the early days of personal computing. Later in life, she lugged a lot of pro-grade camera equipment around the world, taking pictures. And yet she had a hard time figuring out her smartphone. The last recording I have from her saved on my phone, it was a pocket dial.</p><p begin="00:03:07.98" data-timestamp="187.98">[POCKET DIALING]</p><p begin="00:03:09.85" data-timestamp="189.85">This goes on for three minutes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:03:16.60" data-timestamp="196.6"> Did you go for your walk this morning?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:03:18.71" data-timestamp="198.71"> No, I didn't make it this morning. I figured that I was pretty busy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:03:22.78" data-timestamp="202.78"> After mom died, I started calling home a lot more to talk to my stepdad, Ed Hacker. He and I never really had a phone relationship when my mother was alive. It was more the classic thing of, "You wanna say hi to Ed?" And then we'd verbally clap each other on the back, and then back to mom. These days, it's not weird for us to spend almost two hours on the phone together.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:03:43.00" data-timestamp="223"> Then I had to get tweets out, so--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:03:45.84" data-timestamp="225.84"> You are the most active octogenarian on Twitter that I know about.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:03:49.84" data-timestamp="229.84"> Well, I try to send out about six or seven tweets.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:03:52.85" data-timestamp="232.85"> What did you send this morning?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:03:54.83" data-timestamp="234.83"> Oh, I said about three or four.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:03:56.81" data-timestamp="236.81"> I think of how annoyed my mom would be if she knew this, but I'm now performing the exact telephone behavior she wanted from me when she was around, except now with Ed. I call about once a week on average. And it's always me initiating the calls now.</p><p begin="00:04:11.73" data-timestamp="251.73">At first, of course, it was mainly to make sure he was holding up OK, and to make sure I was holding up OK. But even now, when I miss a week, it eats at me, like I'm thinking, "Gotta call Ed, gotta call Ed." It's like an injustice that he's getting this treatment and not her, and I keep trying to square it somehow. But when I put this to Ed, he basically said it's really not that big a mystery.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:04:36.20" data-timestamp="276.2"> Kind of obvious that if one parent dies, you realize that the other one may not be that far off, that he will go too, or she. So you know, the scarcity, just like in economics, makes the value go up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:04:53.86" data-timestamp="293.86"> I never thought of this in economic terms before.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:04:56.35" data-timestamp="296.35"> Well, it's true of many things. If the population is very low--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:05:01.72" data-timestamp="301.72"> Ed's 87. He taught philosophy and logic at a university in Boston for a lot of years. Which is fitting, because Ed is very logical and philosophical. He's always quoting one or another great thinker. For fun, he does math. He and my mom got together when I was six. He moved in when I was 11. And I think he's right that I call because I'm more aware than ever that one day he won't be on the other end of the phone, but it's more than that too.</p><p begin="00:05:27.55" data-timestamp="327.55">Even though we have all of these other people in our family, whom we love, it got to feeling like Ed's the other one mom's death happened to, like he and I were the ones who mutually needed to talk about mom, and to hear about her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:05:42.13" data-timestamp="342.13"> I feel that, yes, I could talk to you about Pat, because you're willing to talk to her about it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:05:49.96" data-timestamp="349.96"> To you about it, yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:05:51.44" data-timestamp="351.44"> And it makes a big difference to me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:05:53.38" data-timestamp="353.38"> It does?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:05:54.61" data-timestamp="354.61"> Of course.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:05:55.12" data-timestamp="355.12"> I'm so glad to hear that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:05:57.10" data-timestamp="357.1"> Because you lost the same person. Even if it's somewhat similar if somebody else has lost someone else, you know, these groups in which everyone has lost a spouse, and their memories are different. You know you never met the other person that died. You really don't care.</p><p begin="00:06:18.54" data-timestamp="378.54">[CHUCKLING]</p><p begin="00:06:20.22" data-timestamp="380.22">You care about your loss. You know, be honest.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:06:25.70" data-timestamp="385.7"> Are you on the deck now?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:06:27.24" data-timestamp="387.24"> I am.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:06:28.48" data-timestamp="388.48"> Having a smoke?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:06:29.84" data-timestamp="389.84"> I am.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:06:35.53" data-timestamp="395.53"> For a long time, my mom was a third invisible person in all of these conversations. And it feels weird to say this, but in some ways, it's like I've gotten to know her better from talking to Ed. And I'm clearer now on what her very last days on earth were like. But we've both noticed we're talking about mom less and less.</p><p begin="00:06:54.85" data-timestamp="414.85">People told me this would happen, but I didn't really believe them. Or I didn't want to. Time slouches on. You wake up to different thoughts in the morning. And when you call home the first thing you say isn't, "How are you holding up?" Like, it used to be that you would mark how long it had been. You'd say like, "I can't believe it'll be three months on Monday," or, "I can't believe it'll be nine months on Thursday or whatever."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:07:19.12" data-timestamp="439.12"> Well, I still keep track of the time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:07:21.46" data-timestamp="441.46"> You do?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:07:23.25" data-timestamp="443.25"> Yeah, and I also have an app on my computer, all three of them, which is set to tell me how many days since Pat died.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:07:33.67" data-timestamp="453.67"> You do?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:07:34.78" data-timestamp="454.78"> I do.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:07:35.48" data-timestamp="455.48"> Oh, I didn't know that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:07:36.43" data-timestamp="456.43"> So this way, I'm going there right now, to see what my apps are. What do they call it now? Got too much junk here.</p><p begin="00:07:47.22" data-timestamp="467.22">[CHUCKLING]</p><p begin="00:07:49.17" data-timestamp="469.17">Oh yes, Count Down. You can set it for anything, you know. I mean-- well, it's been 22 months and three days since she's died. Or if you want, one year, 10 months, and three days. Or if you want, 95-- 96 weeks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:08:12.83" data-timestamp="492.83"> And what do you feel like, looking at that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:08:16.66" data-timestamp="496.66"> Don't have any particular feeling. It's just that it's amazing that it's almost two years. It's like saying I remember.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:08:27.73" data-timestamp="507.73"> Yeah, I feel like I need something like that. I just feel like I don't think about her enough.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:08:38.17" data-timestamp="518.17"> Well, that you'll have to explain. Why should you think more?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:08:42.70" data-timestamp="522.7"> I don't know. It's just like--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:08:44.56" data-timestamp="524.56"> Is it guilt or something?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:08:46.38" data-timestamp="526.38"> It's not guilt, no.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:08:47.58" data-timestamp="527.58"> You want to honor her more by thinking about her?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:08:49.24" data-timestamp="529.24"> Yeah, I want to honor her more by thinking about her, and it also feels like there's something going on in me all the time that I'm not acknowledging, that kind of leaks out in these other ways. And I just miss her. And so it's like I need to put that missing somewhere.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:09:09.62" data-timestamp="549.62"> Well, you have a photograph of Pat?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:09:14.38" data-timestamp="554.38"> Yeah, I have one up on the wall in my office.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:09:17.62" data-timestamp="557.62"> OK, take another one. And every day, move it from one spot to another in your apartment.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:09:26.18" data-timestamp="566.18"> That's a really good idea. Did you just think of that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Hacker</h4><p begin="00:09:30.19" data-timestamp="570.19"> Yes. That makes it sort of a ritual.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:09:41.58" data-timestamp="581.58"> But the truth is, I already have the ritual I need. I don't do it every day, but I do it just about every week. I call Ed. We talk. For this specific need I have, it turns out he's the perfect person to call. Maybe you've got somebody like that, a personal Ghostbuster when there's something strange in the neighborhood, when things are looking their worst, that person who will know what you're talking about, even if they can't understand what you're saying. And all you've gotta do is call.</p><p begin="00:10:12.06" data-timestamp="612.06">Our show today in three area codes is about people lucky enough to find someone like that, in some very dire situations, and also when they need directions to Garbage Street. It's really called that. Stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One: Fass Talker</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:10:31.03" data-timestamp="631.03">Act 1, Fass Talker. There's this legendary late night radio show host on WBAI here in New York named Bob Fass. And he hosts a show called <i>Radio</i> <i>Unnameable.</i> It first went on the air in 1963, and it was Bob's idea. He told the station managers he wanted to talk to all the late shift workers and the other night owls who were up at that hour.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Fass</h4><p begin="00:10:54.35" data-timestamp="654.35"> This is Bob Fass, and this is <i>Radio</i> <i>Unnameable.</i></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:10:57.74" data-timestamp="657.74"> He goes on at midnight, keeps listeners company until dawn. For a while, it aired five or six nights a week, but ultimately the station scaled it back to Thursday nights. WBAI is a listener-funded community station. It's part of the Pacifica Foundation. And when <i>Radio</i> <i>Unnameable</i> started, it was the kind of 1960s, 1970s radio show that really doesn't exist anymore. If Bob liked a song, he might play it over and over again all night. Or he'd play two songs at once.</p><p begin="00:11:25.93" data-timestamp="685.93">Famous musicians like Bob Dylan would drop by after midnight. Sometimes, they performed. And sometimes, Bob would put a ton of people on the phone all at once.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 1</h4><p begin="00:11:36.53" data-timestamp="696.53"> There's snow out there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 2</h4><p begin="00:11:37.63" data-timestamp="697.63"> Snow?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 1</h4><p begin="00:11:38.11" data-timestamp="698.11"> Snow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 2</h4><p begin="00:11:38.88" data-timestamp="698.88"> Where.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 1</h4><p begin="00:11:39.97" data-timestamp="699.97"> Trees.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:11:40.81" data-timestamp="700.81"> This audio is from a documentary movie about Bob's show.

He works in media, writes satire, some humor. He's a freelancer. He and Bob dreamily run through one of the plotlines of an old Betty Field movie called <i>Flesh</i> <i>and</i> <i>Fantasy.</i></p><p begin="00:25:15.22" data-timestamp="1515.22">This is what most of the calls on <i>Radio</i> <i>Unnameable</i> were like. Bob didn't screen them, and there was rarely a point to them. It sounded more like family catching up with each other. And by the way, this wasn't the first time that someone called up the show who was suicidal. Bob says a woman called once, threatening to kill herself, and he managed to talk her down. He says she's still around, doing OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Fass</h4><p begin="00:25:37.00" data-timestamp="1537"> If someone is so lacking in friends and other human contacts that they need the voice that comes out of the radio to be their friend, they're really-- they're in trouble, you know?

The difference is, they weren't exactly the kind of guys you'd call up when you'd already swallowed three kinds of pharmaceuticals. If this caller was looking for empathy, empathy is what Bob specialized in.</p><p begin="00:26:40.22" data-timestamp="1600.22">25 minutes in, Bob seems to have gotten to the guy, in a good way. His guard is down. He's relaxed. He's also on a supreme amount of sedatives, so there's that. They're talking about the smallest little thing. The guy says he's drinking seltzer. Bob asks if it's one of those old fashioned Marx Brothers type bottles that you squirt. The caller says no.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Suicidal Caller</h4><p begin="00:27:01.42" data-timestamp="1621.42"> This is bad, but you can't get that on the East Side.

But then he doesn't. What gets me the most about this whole call is the tone in Bob's voice during it. At the very same time he's being empathetic, he's also saying, "No, don't." It's one of the trickiest balancing acts you can try when relating to another person, something you usually only do when you've reached a bedrock level of intimacy with someone. And here he's doing it with a complete stranger. But Bob says there's a way in which he felt connected to the guy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Fass</h4><p begin="00:28:35.28" data-timestamp="1715.28"> Without going into it too deeply, I had been severely depressed at one important point myself.

His speech is so slurry it's almost incomprehensible. Like tape that's been slowed way down. He keeps talking, but you can tell he's starting to dream at the same time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Fass</h4><p begin="00:29:28.21" data-timestamp="1768.21"> Voices?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Suicidal Caller</h4><p begin="00:29:28.91" data-timestamp="1768.91"> The kids.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Fass</h4><p begin="00:29:30.26" data-timestamp="1770.26"> The kids?

Today's show, <i>Who</i> <i>You</i> <i>Gonna</i> <i>Call?</i> Stories of people finding the specifically perfect person to ring up in their times of need. And now we're at Act 2 of our show. Act 2, <i>A</i> <i>Road</i> <i>By</i> <i>Any</i> <i>Other</i> <i>Name.</i></p><p begin="00:34:17.86" data-timestamp="2057.86">We heard about this woman in New York, who an entire community calls on the phone every day to help them get around town. She's essentially the keeper of a secret map of the city. Aaron Reiss finally secured an audience with her after meeting some of the people she helps.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Aaron Reiss</h4><p begin="00:34:32.44" data-timestamp="2072.44"> A while back, I moved to New York City from China, where I had just spent two years. I wanted to find a way to keep up my Chinese, so I moved into a cramped apartment on Rutgers Street with three elderly immigrants, a married couple and a single man, all in their 70s. And none of them spoke English. I would help them translate their mail. They would feed me home cooked food. We had a good thing.</p><p begin="00:34:53.74" data-timestamp="2093.74">But sometimes I wouldn't understand what they were saying. The woman, for example, tended to go on at length about our neighbors and the noise from upstairs. And even though I'd pick up only a quarter of what she was saying, I would nod along, commiserating, like, totally, I know.</p><p begin="00:35:08.92" data-timestamp="2108.92">One night, we were in the kitchen talking about what we had done that day. And I was having a really hard time understanding where they had gone. They kept saying this was a place on La Zha Gai, which means dirty or garbage street. But I had never heard of that street.</p><p begin="00:35:22.48" data-timestamp="2122.48">After a confusing four or five minutes, I realized that they were actually referring to the street we lived on, right where we were standing. It was just a nickname that a lot of people used for Rutgers Street. I started looking into it, and I learned the streets in Chinatown all have these Chinese names. And not just one. Streets can have four or five different names, each used by a different population in Chinatown-- longtime Toisanese and residents, recent immigrants from Fujian, Cantonese. And there are actually these different Chinese maps of the city with the same streets but different names. I started collecting them. I buy them from this guy, DiCheng, who sells them on the corner.</p><p begin="00:36:04.98" data-timestamp="2164.98">And there are a few people, though not many, who have to know all the names on all of the maps. Like this woman.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mona</h4><p begin="00:36:11.66" data-timestamp="2171.66"> Hello, Lucky?</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Aaron Reiss</h4><p begin="00:36:12.54" data-timestamp="2172.54"> Mona is a human street name almanac, because it is her job to know. She's a dispatcher at a car service in Chinatown called Good Luck. She's in her mid-40s, lots of jewelry, no makeup, glasses. And she's always wearing this expression like, "Do I really need to be explaining this to you right now?"</p><p begin="00:36:28.25" data-timestamp="2188.25">[SPEAKING CHINESE]</p><p begin="00:36:30.15" data-timestamp="2190.15">Right now, she's taking a call from a Cantonese customer who's looking for a car.</p><p begin="00:36:33.76" data-timestamp="2193.76">[SPEAKING CHINESE]</p><p begin="00:36:34.67" data-timestamp="2194.67">She's asking, "Where are you?"</p><p begin="00:36:36.76" data-timestamp="2196.76">[SPEAKING CHINESE]</p><p begin="00:36:37.68" data-timestamp="2197.68">The customer just asked to get picked up on La Zha Gai, Garbage Street. Unlike me, Mona doesn't miss a beat. She knows exactly what the caller is talking about. She tells the driver to go to Rutgers, in English. Then she turns to us and explains one reason why people in Chinatown started using these nicknames in the first place.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mona</h4><p begin="00:36:55.25" data-timestamp="2215.25"> Rutger Street, they cannot pronounce it. So that's why they gave Rutgers Street a nickname. La Zha Gai. La Zha is easy for them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Aaron Reiss</h4><p begin="00:37:05.97" data-timestamp="2225.97"> To understand how this plays out, let's start with just one street, Orchard Street. First, it's got its Cantonese name. Uo Cha Gai. Sounds like "orchard," right? Then its Mandarin pronunciation. Ke Cha Jie. Then there are its translated names, which literally mean "orchard" in Mandarin and Cantonese. Guoyuan Jie and Gwoyoon Gai.</p><p begin="00:37:29.08" data-timestamp="2249.08">Then there's its nickname. Orchard used to be a main street for Jews. So depending on the level of your grandpa style racism, you might call it Jewish Street. Or, as one older guy told me, it's kind of like Cheapskate Street. There are a few versions. I'm Jewish, so don't get me started.</p><p begin="00:37:50.19" data-timestamp="2270.19">[SPEAKING CHINESE]</p><p begin="00:37:52.18" data-timestamp="2272.18">At any given time, there are between three and five dispatchers at Good Luck's tiny Chinatown office, sitting in a row, each of them manning a few phones at once. When Mona hears Dead Person Street, she sends a car to Mulberry, which she knows is named after the funeral homes and florists on the block. When she hears Hatseller Street, she sends a car to Division Street, because, historically, well, hats.</p><p begin="00:38:17.11" data-timestamp="2297.11">There are some puzzlers, like the Kosciuszko Bridge, named after Thaddeus Kosciuszko. Everyone calls it the Yat Boon Jai Kiu, which literally means "the Japanese Guy Bridge." I asked some older ladies in Chinatown why.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:38:29.99" data-timestamp="2309.99"> Because it has so many consonants and vowels, that it looks like a Japanese name.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Aaron Reiss</h4><p begin="00:38:37.24" data-timestamp="2317.24"> He's Polish.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:38:38.13" data-timestamp="2318.13"> Ah, Polish?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mona</h4><p begin="00:38:48.44" data-timestamp="2328.44"> Yeah, hello.

Mona's like, "Slow down, listen to me," trying calmly to get on the same page. But the first time I visited Good Luck, Mona was in the front office with one phone pressed against each ear.

    <div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:41:53.07" data-timestamp="2513.07">Act 3, <i>Ode To</i> <i>Joy.</i> There's this thing President Trump used to say before he got elected. It was part of his regular stump speech, kind of a rallying cry.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Donald Trump</h4><p begin="00:42:01.99" data-timestamp="2521.99"> We're gonna start winning again. We're gonna win so much, you may even get tired of winning! And you'll say, "Please, please, it's too much winning. We can't take it anymore. Mr. President, it's too much!"</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:42:14.15" data-timestamp="2534.15"> And without going into the merits of whether the president is getting tired of too much winning, or whether it is in fact even possible to get tired of too much winning, our program today deals in some ways with advice. And I do think it's possible to get tired of too much advice, for someone to offer so much good advice that's so perfectly suited to you that at some point you decide it just pains you to hear it.</p><p begin="00:42:37.65" data-timestamp="2557.65">The regular host of our show, Ira Glass, heard of that happening to a friend of his. Here's Ira.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:43.55" data-timestamp="2563.55"> The friend is my friend Lucy. And the person who gave her such good advice was not me. Which-- OK, I'm not hurt by that. I personally think the advice that Lucy and I give each other is excellent. Lucy can think what she wants. When it comes to advice, I know that the person who's advice has been a consistent north star in Lucy's life for like 15 years now is a professional advice giver, a psychologist on a call-in radio show who gives advice over the air-- Dr. Joy Browne.</p><p begin="00:43:10.22" data-timestamp="2590.22">Lucy says she likes Dr. Joy Browne because, unlike some other radio psychologists that she's listened to in the past, Dr. Joy Browne doesn't smack her callers over the head with a frying pan and tell them what they're doing is wrong. Joy Browne is kind but deeply pragmatic. There's a whole raft of principles and mottos that come up over and over, all of which Lucy has internalized. Like, "Stupid and cheerful."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:43:30.39" data-timestamp="2610.39"> If somebody is trying to engage you in some sort of passive aggressive issue, you just try to be as stupid and cheerful as possible. So like, if somebody comes into your kitchen and is like, "Oh, you're painting it this color?" You just go like, "Yup. Isn't it great?"</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:47.77" data-timestamp="2627.77"> Oh.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:43:48.42" data-timestamp="2628.42"> You know? Stupid and cheerful. It really works.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joy Browne</h4><p begin="00:43:52.68" data-timestamp="2632.68"> My dear, this is one of those times that you're going to have to be stupid and cheerful.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:56.29" data-timestamp="2636.29"> This, of course, is the doctor herself, talking to a 23-year-old woman named Michelle, who lives with her mom, who explains to Dr. Joy Browne that she's ready to move out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michelle</h4><p begin="00:44:04.29" data-timestamp="2644.29"> Yes, the difficulty is, is that she suffers from mental illness, and she is severely depressed, and she gets verbally abusive, and she yells, and I need to leave.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joy Browne</h4><p begin="00:44:16.95" data-timestamp="2656.95"> OK, how old is mom?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:44:18.46" data-timestamp="2658.46"> Dr. Joy Browne runs through a quick series of questions and ascertains that the mom is 55, not working, single, under therapist care, on meds. Then she pivots to her advice-- stupid and cheerful.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joy Browne</h4><p begin="00:44:29.40" data-timestamp="2669.4"> Equal emphasis on stupid and cheerful. If you go in to your mom, and say, "Mom, I know this is going to really upset you, but it's time for me to leave," if you deal with the subtext, "You're abandoning me. I can't believe you're doing this," you're lost, and so is she. It's not like it benefits either of you. So we're not going to do that. Just be stupid and cheerful.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michelle</h4><p begin="00:44:49.93" data-timestamp="2689.93"> OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joy Browne</h4><p begin="00:44:50.58" data-timestamp="2690.58"> What you need to say is, "Mom, you know what? I found this great apartment. Will you come and help me find some furniture?" And what you're going to have to do is decide that you're going to win the Meryl Streep award for Brooklyn, all right? And you're going to say, "Mom, I'm so excited." And you're going to have to be stupid about the fact that this may be traumatic for her. But it's not your responsibility to take care of your mom at this stage in your life.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:45:15.54" data-timestamp="2715.54"> You can show up on the phone with whatever kind of messy, emotional or non-emotional, trivial or not trivial problem. And you hand her the Rubik's cube of that, and she would ask a few questions, and hand it back to all put together with all the colors on the right side.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joy Browne</h4><p begin="00:45:32.07" data-timestamp="2732.07"> Mom's gotta learn to take care of herself.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michelle</h4><p begin="00:45:34.09" data-timestamp="2734.09"> OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joy Browne</h4><p begin="00:45:34.74" data-timestamp="2734.74"> All righty? Stupid, honey. Stupid and cheerful, stupid and cheerful, stupid and cheerful. All right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michelle</h4><p begin="00:45:39.69" data-timestamp="2739.69"> All right.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:45:41.01" data-timestamp="2741.01"> Lucy likes how encouraging Dr. Joy Browne always is, and kind of good humored. And she's listened to her for thousands of hours, first on the radio, then on podcast. The show is three hours every day. Now Dr. Joy Browne has such a hold over Lucy's thinking and over her heart that Lucy will say things like--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:45:57.79" data-timestamp="2757.79"> Well, you know, we didn't always agree on everything, but mostly.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:46:03.50" data-timestamp="2763.5"> The phrase "we didn't agree about everything" implies that she was in on this relationship too.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:46:08.62" data-timestamp="2768.62"> Well, sort of. Although we didn't agree on everything. You know, she had some beliefs that I didn't believe in.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:46:17.13" data-timestamp="2777.13"> No, again, there's no "we."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:46:20.58" data-timestamp="2780.58"> I guess you're right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:46:23.63" data-timestamp="2783.63"> The look in your face, I said that and your feelings looked really hurt, and I suddenly felt sort of bad.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:46:29.31" data-timestamp="2789.31"> No, don't feel bad. I mean, I guess my relationship with Dr. Joy Browne is at the intersection of incredibly lighthearted and really, really deep-seated and emotional, for me. Like a radio call-in show psychologist, it's a low stakes, right? Except, it's not really. Because people call in with real problems. And so with her, the relationship sits right in the middle of being kind of like a joke and being like a super serious part of my psyche. You know?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:47:09.03" data-timestamp="2829.03"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:47:10.47" data-timestamp="2830.47"> Lucy is so in tune with what Dr. Joy Browne would say in any situation that sometimes when friends and family turn to her for advice, she just doles out whatever she thinks Dr. Joy Browne would say. Like, when her aunt was in a relationship where she was not getting what she wanted, very unhappy, feeling awful.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:47:26.67" data-timestamp="2846.67"> And I said to her, think about what the relationship is like now. Think if you knew you were never going to get any more than this, and you were never going to get any less than this out of the situation. Would you stay or go? And if you would go, how long would you wait before you go? That's straight up Dr. Joy Browne.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:47:48.79" data-timestamp="2868.79"> Mhm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:47:49.46" data-timestamp="2869.46"> And my aunt thought that that was really stellar advice, and it really helped her. And then I had to admit to her that I had gotten it from someone else. But she was still into it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:06.05" data-timestamp="2886.05"> Lucy's called Dr. Joy Browne for advice a half dozen times over the years. She called her for advice the first time when she was just 21, after moving in with her boyfriend. She had never lived with a boyfriend before, and it was going badly. And she did have friends she could turn to for advice, and she could call her mom, who she's really close to. But she didn't want to admit to anybody that she knew that things were going so poorly. Dr. Joy Browne was the perfect anonymous friend.</p><p begin="00:48:31.91" data-timestamp="2911.91">This phone call was so long ago that we weren't able to find recordings of it. Lucy says she was sitting on the floor in the hallway of the little apartment in North Carolina when she phoned.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:48:40.24" data-timestamp="2920.24"> You're hearing the radio show in the phone, because you have talked to the screener. You've told them your question. And then you have to wait until she says your name.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:49.86" data-timestamp="2929.86"> Yeah, what's that like?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:48:50.98" data-timestamp="2930.98"> It's incredibly nerve-wracking and, you know, palms sweating, and thinking about hanging up, and just wondering when it's going to happen. She could say your name at any time. And then she does. She says "Lucy, what's your question?" And I describe my situation, and I think that I cried a little bit. That's my memory.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:19.62" data-timestamp="2959.62"> What was her advice?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:49:21.18" data-timestamp="2961.18"> Her advice was to leave the relationship right then.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:25.86" data-timestamp="2965.86"> How many minutes did you talk to her before she said that? Like, was it 10, 5?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:49:30.51" data-timestamp="2970.51"> No, maybe like 2 and 1/2.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:32.09" data-timestamp="2972.09"> 2 and 1/2 minutes?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:49:33.72" data-timestamp="2973.72"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:34.65" data-timestamp="2974.65"> Wow, that's a really sobering thing, that you could talk to a stranger for 2 and 1/2 minutes, and they're just like, "Yeah, got it. OK, leave him."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:49:42.21" data-timestamp="2982.21"> Yeah, she said leave. And she said, get your own apartment, and start your own life there, and just get out of the situation.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:49.38" data-timestamp="2989.38"> Did you think it was good advice?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:49:53.73" data-timestamp="2993.73"> It was not what I wanted to hear. I wanted to be told how to fix it, you know? That advice to leave seemed completely impossible.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:06.46" data-timestamp="3006.46"> How long did it take for you to leave?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:50:07.74" data-timestamp="3007.74"> It took about a year.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:11.22" data-timestamp="3011.22"> In retrospect, do you think you should have taken the advice when she gave it to you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:50:14.34" data-timestamp="3014.34"> Yes</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:15.77" data-timestamp="3015.77"> Why call in to an advice show if you're not going to take the advice?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:50:19.05" data-timestamp="3019.05"> I think, in a way, my mind went blank, and I was just shaken by her response. I just thought, this person who I've come to know and trust so much? I don't know. I was pretty shocked that she told me I should leave.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:41.58" data-timestamp="3041.58"> Lucy called once for advice about dealing with her parents, and once for advice about a situation with her sister. Both times she took the advice, and says it went great. One of her professors was dying. She wanted to write him a letter saying some nice things, but wasn't sure that somebody would want to get a letter saying "I hear you're dying, and so I wrote you this letter." Dr. Joy Browne told her to send the letter. Of course send it. It's kindness. Which she did.</p><p begin="00:51:05.23" data-timestamp="3065.23">And something else happened on that call that Lucy loved.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:51:07.58" data-timestamp="3067.58"> She called me "cookie" during that call, I remember. Which is something that she called a lot of people from time to time. So it was a thrill to me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:51:15.74" data-timestamp="3075.74"> But did she only call them cookie if she liked them?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:51:18.11" data-timestamp="3078.11"> I think it was an affectionate term.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:51:20.69" data-timestamp="3080.69"> It sounds pretty affectionate.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:51:21.86" data-timestamp="3081.86"> Yeah, I mean, cookies are great.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:51:26.43" data-timestamp="3086.43"> Noted.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:51:28.49" data-timestamp="3088.49"> This went on for years. Lucy listened to Dr. Joy Browne for hours every day, and occasionally phoning her up for advice. And then her whole situation with Dr. Joy Browne took a turn. This happened in just the last few years, during the time that Lucy and I had been friends. Lucy was having some troubles, and was really pretty miserable. And she could have called Dr. Joy Browne for advice, but she never did.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:51:51.65" data-timestamp="3111.65"> No, actually, for the last few years, I had not been listening to her. I stopped listening to her, in large part because I got into several relationship situations in a row that I knew that she would totally not approve of.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:10.92" data-timestamp="3130.92"> One of them is somebody who is possessive and not so nice to her. One was somebody married, separated but married.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:52:17.84" data-timestamp="3137.84"> And I think it became too embarrassing for me to listen to her, the way that I used to.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:25.92" data-timestamp="3145.92"> You mean embarrassing like you feel like you couldn't be in her presence because you knew what she would think of what you were doing?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:52:31.92" data-timestamp="3151.92"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:32.94" data-timestamp="3152.94"> You felt like you knew her that well?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:52:34.50" data-timestamp="3154.5"> Yeah, I felt like if I had called her with a problem about one of these relationships, we wouldn't have even gotten to my problem I was having. She would have, right off the bat, said well, the problem here is that you're not following the One Year Rule. She had this thing called the One Year Rule.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joy Browne</h4><p begin="00:52:54.89" data-timestamp="3174.89"> Yeah, well, I keep telling people you need to go through a year by yourself after the breakup of an important relationship, whether it's divorce or death.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:04.80" data-timestamp="3184.8"> This is Dr. Joy Browne explaining the One Year Rule to a caller.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joy Browne</h4><p begin="00:53:07.62" data-timestamp="3187.62"> Because you'll make different decisions based on need than you will on want. And when you're feeling really lonely and really sad, you'll succumb to things that, if you're feeling better about yourself, you wouldn't do.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:18.99" data-timestamp="3198.99"> And this is a caller named Angela who phoned to thank Dr. Browne for the One Year Rule.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Angela</h4><p begin="00:53:22.76" data-timestamp="3202.76"> You know, Dr. Joy, in the beginning, I was thinking Dr. Joy is crazy. One year? That's a long time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joy Browne</h4><p begin="00:53:28.54" data-timestamp="3208.54"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Angela</h4><p begin="00:53:29.35" data-timestamp="3209.35"> But no, it is the greatest time I've been having all these days.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joy Browne</h4><p begin="00:53:33.87" data-timestamp="3213.87"> Well, that's great. And you're probably a much happier person than you were a year ago, which means that you're going to be much more date-able, and you'll find somebody who is more wonderful than you would have a year ago. So that's great.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Angela</h4><p begin="00:53:44.88" data-timestamp="3224.88"> Yes, I am super super duper happy! Thank you very much, and God bless you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:48.90" data-timestamp="3228.9"> So Lucy knew the score. She hadn't obeyed the One Year Rule. The people she was with hadn't either. And she saw the basic wisdom of the doctor's One Year Rule.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:53:57.54" data-timestamp="3237.54"> And I knew that she would have said like "No, no, no. This is not going to work. You've got to get out of it." I think it became a lot less fun for me to listen to her because I knew that I was in a mess, you know? And I knew that if I had really taken her advice, I wouldn't be in that mess.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:20.33" data-timestamp="3260.33"> Lucy was like a sinner who doesn't like stepping foot in church, because it reminds 'em just how far they'd fallen. So she stayed away. And then, finally, not long ago, Lucy got out of that last relationship. She was single again. And it only took a day or two after that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:54:42.81" data-timestamp="3282.81"> And I was in a taxi, and I suddenly thought, "I'm going to look up Dr. Joy Browne's podcast, and I'm going to start listening again.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:52.11" data-timestamp="3292.11"> Right, because finally you could. Because you felt like you wouldn't feel this guilt.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:54:55.38" data-timestamp="3295.38"> Yeah, I had a clean slate.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:00.10" data-timestamp="3300.1"> Mhm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:55:00.48" data-timestamp="3300.48"> So I looked her up, and I was totally shocked and horrified to find that she had just died two days before, very suddenly. And I was really sad, and really panicked. Like, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait. I need to-- like, what? No, no, no. I need to listen to your show. You can't die.</p><p begin="00:55:28.06" data-timestamp="3328.06">I just was going to start listening again, and I just missed her. Like, I just missed her by two days. She was doing her show that week. She was totally well, and as far as anyone knew. And I was really sad.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:42.79" data-timestamp="3342.79"> How long had you not listened to her?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:55:44.96" data-timestamp="3344.96"> Probably-- maybe five years.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:51.86" data-timestamp="3351.86"> Do you feel like you let her down?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:55:54.81" data-timestamp="3354.81"> Yeah, I felt like I'd jumped ship, and taken her for granted, and thought she would be there when I resurfaced from whatever kind of messy mess I had gotten myself into. You know that thing that people say, "When I just like make enough money, then I'll get my life together, when I just lose enough weight, then I'll get my life together." And I think in the period where I stopped listening to her, I was thinking like, "Once I sort all this out, I'll get back to listening to Dr. Joy and I'll resurface as the person I was before, once I clean up this mess." But I never did. And then, when I resurfaced, she was gone.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:44.64" data-timestamp="3404.64"> It made her totally re-evaluate her relationship with Dr. Joy Browne. All those years she thought, the two of them so in agreement. She felt so close to her. It made her realize, oh, maybe she was just kidding herself.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:56:55.98" data-timestamp="3415.98"> I guess it does use to listen thinking people would call in, and they'd give their situation, and I'd just think, "Oh boy, here's the problem with what you're saying. I know what she's going to say." And then she would say it, and I was sitting back like, "Dr. Joy and I, we know the rules, and that's not going to work."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:16.36" data-timestamp="3436.36"> Yeah. And it's like you and her against the losers. But then you were going like, "Oh, wait a second. No, I'm one of the losers."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:57:23.10" data-timestamp="3443.1"> Well, I mean, losers, she had a warm heart.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:26.10" data-timestamp="3446.1"> She wouldn't use that word. No, but you know what I'm saying.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:57:29.41" data-timestamp="3449.41"> They were like the people who were astray. And you know, I had a lot of big ideas about how I had it together. And I was doing it wrong too. And even though I knew better, even though I used to sit there, imagining myself near Dr. Joy Browne, I know what she would say, but I would feel better if she were here to say it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:56.00" data-timestamp="3476"> Yeah. There's a thing that people say to each other in movies that I've never, ever in my life had an impulse to say to somebody, but I do now. And that is, "Well, you carry her inside you."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:58:15.94" data-timestamp="3495.94"> Um, well, what does the other person in the movie say, then?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:58:20.16" data-timestamp="3500.16"> Usually, they're really moved.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:58:22.08" data-timestamp="3502.08"> Oh, well.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:58:23.28" data-timestamp="3503.28"> In the movies! Hold on for a second. This is the kind of music that we play in the movie. Hold on.

I'm going to say it to you again. Lucy, even though she's gone, you don't have to feel bad, because you carry her inside you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucy</h4><p begin="00:58:39.56" data-timestamp="3519.56"> And then I would just say, "I guess you're right."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:58:42.93" data-timestamp="3522.93"> There you go.</p><p begin="00:58:43.82" data-timestamp="3523.82">[CHUCKLING]</p><p begin="00:58:45.70" data-timestamp="3525.7">That was excellent line-reading.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:58:54.19" data-timestamp="3534.19"> Ira Glass.
