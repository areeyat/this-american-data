    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.50" data-timestamp="0.5"> From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass.</p><p begin="00:00:03.51" data-timestamp="3.51"></p><p begin="00:00:03.82" data-timestamp="3.82">There's this theater company in Chicago that, for years, put out a new show every single week where they performed 30 plays in 60 minutes, called the Neo-Futurists. And when we first broadcast today's program all the way back in 2003, a bunch of us were sitting around talking about that group. And one of us had just seen one of their shows. And we thought, that would be really fun-- 30 stories in 60 minutes? Let's try that.</p><p begin="00:00:29.21" data-timestamp="29.21">Instead of our usual-- each week we choose a theme, bring you three or four stories, blah, blah, blah, public radio, very reflective, what kinds of stories would we end up with if we did 30 in one hour? Or even 20? What would it sound like?</p><p begin="00:00:45.06" data-timestamp="45.06">We honestly had no idea. And so, that's what we're going to do today. Today we're going to find out. And I have to say, time is wasting if we're going to fit everything in.</p><p begin="00:00:57.22" data-timestamp="57.22">How many will it be? How many will we squeeze in? There is but one way to find out, and that is to stick around.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One: Don't I Know You</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:05.77" data-timestamp="65.77">(HOST) IRA GLASS: And let's begin with this one, Act One-- Don't I Know You? Throughout this hour we're going to be bringing you two-minute documentaries, fantastically short works of fiction, and all kinds of little stories that we ordinarily can't use on the radio show because they are just too short, even though they're really fun stories to listen to and perfect stories for the radio. Our first story is one like that. It's one of those stories-- you know how people you know have their greatest hits stories of things that happened to them? We went on a massive search for stories like that from all over the country, and this is one of the stories like that that we found.</p><p begin="00:01:38.03" data-timestamp="98.03">It happened to this actor named Tate Donovan. He told it to our producer Starlee Kine. He was out one night going to a Broadway play with a friend, being treated in this way he never gets treated.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tate Donovan</h4><p begin="00:01:47.97" data-timestamp="107.97"> We're sitting around waiting for it to start. And I'm not a very-- I'm not a sort of a recognizable actor. I'm an actor who works, but I never get recognized.</p><p begin="00:02:00.04" data-timestamp="120.04">So all of a sudden, the 10 minutes we're sitting there for it to start, three or four people come up to me and recognize me. I mean, they know exactly who I am. And they are quoting lines from a television show I was on. And like, hey, you were Joshua on <i>Friends.</i></p><p begin="00:02:17.47" data-timestamp="137.47">And I've always admired stars who were really gracious. So you always think, that's what I want to be like. I want to be really friendly when I'm famous. So I wanted to be friendly and sweet, and go out to the people. They don't have to come to me all the time.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:02:30.60" data-timestamp="150.6"> [LAUGHS] So for a little window of time, though, you were exactly the kind of celebrity that you wanted to always be. You were gracious and reserved.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tate Donovan</h4><p begin="00:02:38.76" data-timestamp="158.76"> Yeah, and warm, you know what I mean? I wasn't like one of these distant celebrities. I was like, hey, I was genuine. They all left thinking, that guy's a really great guy. He's so sweet.</p><p begin="00:02:49.08" data-timestamp="169.08">I was exactly how I wanted to be. I was doing it. I was doing great.</p><p begin="00:02:53.02" data-timestamp="173.02">And then the kid with the camera came along. This nervous kid-- I don't know, he must have been 16 years old. He's in a rented tuxedo, unbelievably shy and awkward, and he's got acne. And he's got a camera in his hand.</p><p begin="00:03:14.25" data-timestamp="194.25">And underneath the marquee is his date, who is in literally a prom dress, and she's got a corsage. And she's really nervous and sort of clutching her hands. And he sort of comes up to me and he sort of mumbles something about a picture.</p><p begin="00:03:32.88" data-timestamp="212.88">And I just feel for him. So I'm like, absolutely, my gosh. Sure, no problem. My God, you poor thing. And I go up to his girlfriend and I wrap my arms around her.</p><p begin="00:03:43.72" data-timestamp="223.72">And I'm like, hey, where are you from? Fantastic, you going to see the play? That's great.</p><p begin="00:03:48.66" data-timestamp="228.66">And the guy is sort of not taking the photograph very quickly. He's just sort of staring at me. And he's got his camera in his hands and it's down by his chin.</p><p begin="00:03:56.82" data-timestamp="236.82">And she's very stiff and awkward. And I don't know what to do, so I just lean across, and I kiss her on the cheek. And I'm like, all right, come on, take the picture. Hurry up.</p><p begin="00:04:08.43" data-timestamp="248.43">And finally he sort of snaps it. And I'm like, OK, it was really wonderful to meet you. And he just stammered over to me and was like, um, [CLICKS TONGUE] could you take a picture of us?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:04:23.09" data-timestamp="263.09"> [GROANS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tate Donovan</h4><p begin="00:04:24.58" data-timestamp="264.58"> And the whole time, he just wanted me to take a picture of him and his girlfriend underneath the awning of the play.

They were in shock. I don't think they'd ever come across a human being acting this way. I mean, could you imagine-- you ask someone to take a picture, and you just get in it yourself, and kiss them, and hey.</p><p begin="00:04:57.16" data-timestamp="297.16">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:05:00.08" data-timestamp="300.08"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:02.51" data-timestamp="302.51"> Tate Donovan with Starlee Kine.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act Two: No, Of Course I Know You</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:09.31" data-timestamp="309.31">(HOST) IRA GLASS: Act Two-- No, Of Course I Know You. One of the things that's been really interesting about putting this show together this week is going to some of our regular contributors and commissioning stories that are just two or three minutes long from people who normally write stories that are 10 times that length. This story is an example of that, from Scott Carrier in Salt Lake City.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Scott Carrier</h4><p begin="00:05:28.80" data-timestamp="328.8"> Who was that woman, that woman I just saw while walking out of the restaurant? She was sitting at a table by the door, glasses, a hat, like Lois Lane.</p><p begin="00:05:40.61" data-timestamp="340.61">She looked at me like she knew me. And I said hello because I thought I recognized her. But I couldn't remember her name, so I just kept going out the door.</p><p begin="00:05:49.68" data-timestamp="349.68">Now I can't even remember how I know her. I know I know her, or used to know her. Somehow she was very important to me. She helped me out in a time of trouble.</p><p begin="00:06:01.89" data-timestamp="361.89">She used to roll her eyes. I'd say something dumb and she'd roll her eyes and get me something I needed, even though she didn't have to. Maybe she works in the library, or the county recorder's office, or at the newspaper.</p><p begin="00:06:18.04" data-timestamp="378.04">I think I may have been in love with her. No, she's too young. I was never in love with her, not in that way. It's just that I wanted something, needed something. And she was able to give it to me, almost out of the goodness of her heart. And now I can't even remember who she is.</p><p begin="00:06:36.90" data-timestamp="396.9">I'm sick. I'm old. I should just walk out into traffic and kill myself. At home, at night, I go to sleep, searching for the lost memory.</p><p begin="00:06:47.78" data-timestamp="407.78">Did I meet her down by the river in a canoe, or was it on a ferry in southeastern Alaska, or at the Foreign Correspondents Club in Phnom Penh along the Mekong? She has something to do with water, with life, with mud.</p><p begin="00:07:10.75" data-timestamp="430.75">I sleep poorly, turning and maybe even groaning in anguish. I don't care about the woman anymore. I'm worried for myself. I feel as if there's a black hole in my brain, and slowly but surely, it's swallowing all the memories of my life.</p><p begin="00:07:27.32" data-timestamp="447.32">I get up at 5:30 and drive to work in the dark. I feel terrible. I look like a piece of gum in the gutter.</p><p begin="00:07:35.14" data-timestamp="455.14">I pull in to Java Joe's to get some chemical help, and there she is behind the drive-up window. I want to tell her I love her, but I don't because it would be too weird. All I can say is, wow. And she rolls her eyes and gets me my cup of coffee.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:56.99" data-timestamp="476.99"> Scott Carrier in Salt Lake City.

  <h3>Act Seven: Up Where the Air Is Clear</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:43.77" data-timestamp="1063.77">(HOST) IRA GLASS: Act Seven-- Up Where the Air is Clear. We have this story from Jonathan Goldstein.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:17:49.03" data-timestamp="1069.03"> Before he ever moved to Gotham City, before he grew into the overweight, obsessive sad sack of his later years, the Penguin was a poet and a dandy who lived in London. He wrote complex villanelles and threw lavish dinner parties at which he only became more charming the more he drank. He wore a monocle, a top hat, and carried an umbrella.</p><p begin="00:18:10.18" data-timestamp="1090.18">One evening, at one of his dinner parties, after hours spent sipping absinthe, the Penguin ran up to the roof of his building, opened up his large black umbrella, and leaped off into the air. As he coasted to the ground, he hollered out lines from Blake, stuff about grabbing life by the fat of its stomach and giving it a twist. He was that crazy. He was that bursting with life.</p><p begin="00:18:33.64" data-timestamp="1113.64">From that night on, he made it his habit to jump off roofs ever higher, while clutching an umbrella. After a while, he got pretty good at it, too. He saw that by kicking his legs and twisting his back a certain way, he could actually prolong his flight, coasting all over the place, sometimes only landing after several daring minutes aloft.</p><p begin="00:19:01.94" data-timestamp="1141.94">It came to pass that the Penguin started hearing more and more about a certain nanny named Mary Poppins. She too, he was told, had been floating around London hanging from an umbrella handle. Everywhere he went, the Penguin kept hearing about her, how it was simply insane that they had not met each other yet.</p><p begin="00:19:18.77" data-timestamp="1158.77">So finally, a dinner party was arranged by someone who knew them both. And on the evening of the party, the Penguin walked into the drawing room, saw Mary Poppins on the divan, doffed his top hat, and bowed low, as was his style in those days. He'd planned a few things to say and do when first meeting Mary Poppins. He thought he might lift up his umbrella as though challenging her to a duel. He imagined she would smile and take up her own frilly, perhaps pink, umbrella, and then together, they would dance about the room, leaping over furniture, parrying and thrusting, perhaps even winding things up, breathing heavily nose to nose.</p><p begin="00:19:56.76" data-timestamp="1196.76">Instead what happened was the Penguin became very shy and quiet. As he stood there staring at her, his top hat felt needlessly clumsy, his monocle too small for his face. And the squinting needed to keep it in place was giving him a slight headache. For the first time in his life, the Penguin felt ludicrous.</p><p begin="00:20:15.41" data-timestamp="1215.41">I imagine you two must have an infinite amount of things to speak of, said their host as he sat them together at the dinner table. The Penguin nodded uncertainly. After three or four minutes, it became clear that the Penguin and Mary Poppins had absolutely nothing to say to one another that did not deal exclusively with umbrella travel-- getting stuck in trees, the shoulder aches, anxiety about tipping over in the wind.</p><p begin="00:20:39.62" data-timestamp="1239.62">Everyone at the table just sat there, staring at them expectantly, which made the whole thing even more awkward. Trying to move things along, Mary Poppins asked the Penguin if he liked to sing, to which the Penguin responded, only when I'm drunk. Then she asked if he enjoyed children, to which he replied, yes, in a sweet wine sauce.</p><p begin="00:21:00.64" data-timestamp="1260.64">The Penguin then asked Mary Poppins how she kept people from looking up her skirt when she flew. She smiled politely, then turned to the man on her left and asked him how he was enjoying the lamb. The man on her left was wearing an elegant, aristocratic cape. Mary, a bit drunk on the sherry, noted that if he spread his cape out, he might be able to glide about like a bat. The man on her left chuckled and suggested that, after dinner, they head up to the roof and give it a try, which they did.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:21:36.48" data-timestamp="1296.48"> Jonathan Goldstein-- he's the host of the podcast <i>Heavyweight,</i> which feels exactly like this story except the people in it are not fictional.</p></div>  </div>

Now put me through to Marty.</p><p begin="00:29:36.60" data-timestamp="1776.6">A few hours later, I was in Boston relating the story to my sister, Tiffany. I mean, he actually placed a call while sitting on the toilet. Tiffany is big on rules, and so I expected a certain degree of outrage. I wanted disgust, but instead, she said only, I don't believe in cell phones. But you do believe in talking on the phone while sitting on the toilet?</p><p begin="00:30:00.46" data-timestamp="1800.46">Well, it's not a belief, she said, but I mean, sure. When asked how she explains the noise, Tiffany scrunched up her face and held an imaginary receiver to her mouth. I say, (STRAINING) don't mind me, I'm just trying to get the lid off this jar.</p><p begin="00:30:18.59" data-timestamp="1818.59">Her face returned to normal and I thought of all the times I had fallen for that line, all the times I had pictured my sister standing helpless in her kitchen. Try tapping the lid against the countertop, I'd said, or rinse it in hot water, that sometimes works. Eventually, after much struggle, she would let out a breath. There we go, she'd say. I've got it now. And then she would say thank you. And I'd hang up thinking, well, it's a good thing she called me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:30:50.31" data-timestamp="1850.31"> David Sedaris.

See all the stupid jokes that you end up telling if you have a story that takes place in a hot dog factory about hot dogs? Here we go.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jim Bodman</h4><p begin="00:34:25.74" data-timestamp="2065.74"> My name is Jim Bodman and I'm the chairman of the Vienna Sausage Company in Chicago. And the building that we are currently standing in, which is on the north side of Chicago, on Damen near the corner of Fullerton, was built around 1970.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:34:43.33" data-timestamp="2083.33"> This hot dog plant, Jim Bodman says, replaced the company's original facility.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jim Bodman</h4><p begin="00:34:46.57" data-timestamp="2086.57"> So it was put together in a Rube Goldberg kind of arrangement. So we moved into this building. And this was a brand new, state of the art, stainless steel, refrigeration is perfect, spit clean building. And we started making our natural, old-world hickory smoked, natural-casing hot dogs here. And it wasn't as good.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:35:10.48" data-timestamp="2110.48"> They tasted OK, he says, but they didn't have the right snap when you bit into them. And even worse, the color was wrong. The hot dogs were all pink instead of bright red. So they tried to figure out what was wrong.</p><p begin="00:35:23.10" data-timestamp="2123.1">The ingredients were all the same, the spices were all the same, the process was all the same. Maybe it was the temperature in the smokehouse. Maybe the water on the north side of Chicago wasn't the same as the water on the South side.</p><p begin="00:35:34.48" data-timestamp="2134.48">They searched. They searched for a year and a half. Nothing checked out.</p><p begin="00:35:39.73" data-timestamp="2139.73">Then one night, a bunch of guys from the plant are out having a drink, gabbing about the good old days, back in the old plant on Maxwell Street. They start talking about this guy named Irving, one of those guys who knows everybody in the plant, has nicknames for everybody. And listen to what Irving's job was. Every day, he would weave his way with the uncooked sausages through the maze of passageways in the old plant.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jim Bodman</h4><p begin="00:36:00.82" data-timestamp="2160.82"> He would go through the hanging vents. That's where we hang the pastrami pieces, and it's quite warm. And he would go through the boiler room, where we produced all the energy for the plant. He would go next to the tanks where we cook the corned beef, finally get around the corner, and in some cases, actually go up an elevator. And then he would be at the smokehouse. He would put it in the smokehouse and he would cook it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:36:21.25" data-timestamp="2181.25"> And as they were telling stories about Irving-- Irving this, Irving that-- a light bulb goes off. In the fancy new modern plant, there was no Irving. Irving didn't want to commute to the north side.</p><p begin="00:36:32.35" data-timestamp="2192.35">There was no maze of hallways. There was no half-hour trip where the sausage would get warm before they would cook it. In the new plant, they just stuffed the sausages in a cold room and cooked them in a smokehouse in the room next door to it. Irving's trip was the secret ingredient that made the dogs red. So secret, even the guys who ran the plant didn't know about it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jim Bodman</h4><p begin="00:36:52.82" data-timestamp="2212.82"> So we said, oh, my God, that is, of course, the reason. Why didn't we know that? That's the dumbest thing in the world to not realize. It's right there.</p><p begin="00:37:00.13" data-timestamp="2220.13">How do we fix it? And the solution to the problem was the room that we're standing in right now. And this was a new addition put onto the plant about two years after we built the facility.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:37:11.59" data-timestamp="2231.59"> So you had to build this room?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jim Bodman</h4><p begin="00:37:12.91" data-timestamp="2232.91"> This whole room-- the outside bearing wall is that wall right there. We put this whole room on. And in this room, we emulate the old area of the old plant.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:37:22.99" data-timestamp="2242.99"> And so this room, essentially, is to simulate Irving?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jim Bodman</h4><p begin="00:37:27.25" data-timestamp="2247.25"> That's exactly right. We should have called it Irving-- Irving's Corner.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:37:32.38" data-timestamp="2252.38"> It's warm in Irving's corner, and it smells nice, too-- smoky, like hickory smoke and spices. Since I first heard this story years ago on a tour of this very plant, I found myself telling it now and then. I think that what I love about it is the fact that these guys at the factory had done everything right-- finally built their dream factory with the best equipment and expertise that money could buy. But you can't think of everything. Sometimes you have no idea why you were a success in the first place.</p></div>  </div>

It's a combination of longevity, era, critical acclaim, commercial success, and, most importantly, the aesthetic soul of each artistic entity.</p><p begin="00:47:16.80" data-timestamp="2836.8">For example, the Rolling Stones are <i>Gunsmoke.</i> The Strokes-- Kiefer Sutherland's <i>24.</i> Jimi Hendrix was <i>The</i> <i>Twilight</i> <i>Zone.</i> Devo was <i>Fernwood</i> <i>2Night.</i></p><p begin="00:47:31.53" data-timestamp="2851.53">Lynyrd Skynyrd was <i>The</i> <i>Beverly</i> <i>Hillbillies,</i> which makes Molly Hatchet <i>Petticoat</i> <i>Junction.</i> The Black Crowes are <i>That</i> <i>70s</i> <i>Show.</i> Hall and Oates were <i>Bosom</i> <i>Buddies.</i></p><p begin="00:47:40.98" data-timestamp="2860.98">U2 is <i>M.A.S.H.</i> because both kind of got preachy at the end. Dokken was Jason Bateman's short lived sitcom, <i>It's</i> <i>Your</i> <i>Move.</i> The Eurythmics were <i>Mork</i> <i>and</i> <i>Mindy.</i></p><p begin="00:47:51.87" data-timestamp="2871.87">We even deduced comparisons for solo projects, which can only be made to series that were spawned as spin-offs. The four Beatles, post-1970, are as follows: John equals <i>Maude,</i> Paul equals <i>Frasier,</i> George equals <i>The</i> <i>Jeffersons,</i> and Ringo equals <i>Flow.</i> David Lee Roth's solo period after Van Halen was <i>Knot's</i> <i>Landing.</i> So there's proof-- marijuana makes you smarter.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:24.50" data-timestamp="2904.5"> Chuck Klosterman reading from his book called <i>Sex,</i> <i>Drugs,</i> <i>and</i> <i>Cocoa</i> <i>Puffs:</i> <i>A</i> <i>Low</i> <i>Culture</i> <i>Manifesto.</i></p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act Nineteen: The Hard Life at the Top</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:34.79" data-timestamp="2914.79">(HOST) IRA GLASS: Act 19-- The Hard Life at the Top. Here's a ritual that takes place every summer on the last day of June-- 1,200 new army cadets, mostly teenagers, survivors of one of the most exhausting application processes in the country, arrive at West Point. And then, in the space of one morning, they're separated from their parents. Their clothes are taken away. Their hair is taken away.</p><p begin="00:48:55.97" data-timestamp="2935.97">They're weighed. They're measured. They're issued a bag, an army uniform, and underwear. They take their oath of office.</p><p begin="00:49:02.10" data-timestamp="2942.1">And then, here is the first act they have as non-civilians. All they have to do is say a single sentence. Once they get it said, they can go to their barracks, but not until then. David Lipsky spent four years writing about these guys and describes what happens each year.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Lipsky</h4><p begin="00:49:17.17" data-timestamp="2957.17"> The drill is simple. The new cadets have to step up to a tape line, drop their bags, and make their report to upperclassman wearing red sashes. You will walk up to the line, the red sashes tell them. And you will say, sir, new cadet Doe reports to the cadet and the red sash for the first time as ordered.</p><p begin="00:49:34.97" data-timestamp="2974.97">The new cadets swallow, nod their heads, and then the screwing up begins. This cadet is so nervous, he doesn't realize he's supposed to swap his own name for Doe.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cadet</h4><p begin="00:49:43.62" data-timestamp="2983.62"> Sir, new cadet Doe reports to the cadet--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Red Sash </h4><p begin="00:49:45.87" data-timestamp="2985.87">(SUBJECT) RED SASH #1: Is your last name Doe?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cadet</h4><p begin="00:49:47.23" data-timestamp="2987.23"> No, sir.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Red Sash </h4><p begin="00:49:48.08" data-timestamp="2988.08">(SUBJECT) RED SASH #1: Then say your name, new cadet.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cadet</h4><p begin="00:49:49.89" data-timestamp="2989.89"> Yes, sir.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Lipsky</h4><p begin="00:49:50.35" data-timestamp="2990.35"> "Is your last name Doe?" the red sash screams. "No, sir," says the new cadet. "Then say your name, new cadet," says the red sash. Words count, even footwork counts. New cadet Clinker, a jittery 18-year-old female cadet, finds this out when she steps a little too far forward.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cadet Clinker</h4><p begin="00:50:07.28" data-timestamp="3007.28"> Sir, new cadet Clinker.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Red Sash </h4><p begin="00:50:08.57" data-timestamp="3008.57">(SUBJECT) RED SASH #1: New cadet, look where you're standing.

The day before, they've even practiced being hard on local civilians in a full rehearsal. Every year, a bunch of teachers, sons, daughters, groundskeepers from around town sign up for a fun day as practice cadets. Every year, a handful leave in tears.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cadet Mcleod</h4><p begin="00:50:49.81" data-timestamp="3049.81"> Sir, new cadet McLeod reporting to the cadet in the-- in the red sash for the first time as ordered.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Red Sash</h4><p begin="00:50:54.63" data-timestamp="3054.63"> Drop your salute.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Lipsky</h4><p begin="00:50:56.11" data-timestamp="3056.11"> New cadet McLeod stutters on his first attempt. He's asked to drop his salute and start over. On this one day, almost 1,200 young men and women will make their report. If everyone did it right the first time, it would take about an hour. I don't see anyone go through the first time. It takes all day. New cadet McLeod tries again, but the words won't come.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cadet Mcleod</h4><p begin="00:51:16.96" data-timestamp="3076.96"> Sir, n-new cadet McLeod-- new--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Red Sash</h4><p begin="00:51:20.01" data-timestamp="3080.01"> Drop your salute.

  <h3>Act Twenty: The Greatest Moment I Ever Saw On a Stage</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:39.52" data-timestamp="3159.52">(HOST) IRA GLASS: Act 20-- The Greatest Moment I Ever Saw On a Stage. I'll say, first of all, that this moment that I saw caught me completely off guard. I was at a play where I was not expecting anything special. It was put on by an organization that works with teenagers. Storycatchers Theatre is what it's called.</p><p begin="00:52:56.74" data-timestamp="3176.74">And among other things, they get kids who are locked up in Chicago's juvenile detention center, The Audy Home, to write and perform musicals about their lives. This one was performed by teenage girls. OK, so we're in the detention center. Folding chairs have been set up.</p><p begin="00:53:13.68" data-timestamp="3193.68">The girls' parents-- it's mostly mothers and grandmothers, very few men-- are sitting directly in front of the stage. And imagine for a minute what it's like to be one of those parents, OK? Your kid's locked up, possibly on very serious charges, some of these girls were. You're worried about what's going to happen to them next. You're probably still mad that they didn't listen to you in the first place and got into all this trouble and ended up behind bars.</p><p begin="00:53:36.33" data-timestamp="3216.33">What can theater possibly do for you in this situation? It seems like such an old-fashioned idea that it can do anything. So there's this one scene in the play.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Actress 1</h4><p begin="00:53:49.00" data-timestamp="3229"> Where'd you get these clothes from?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:50.58" data-timestamp="3230.58"> And it's the story of this girl named Candace. And Candace basically wanted better clothes so the other kids at school wouldn't laugh at her. She steal some clothes from Nike Town. And she gets in trouble, she gets caught. And then she joins a gang to earn some money and be more popular.</p><p begin="00:54:04.26" data-timestamp="3244.26">Her mom finds some drugs in the house, and a gun, and feels completely betrayed because that was not how she raised her daughter. And one thing leads to another, and Candace gets locked up.</p><p begin="00:54:12.97" data-timestamp="3252.97">[MUSIC PLAYING]</p><p begin="00:54:14.63" data-timestamp="3254.63">Then, the girl narrating the story says, and this is how Candace feels about her mom now. And then all the girls in the play come out on the stage and stand in a line, facing their mothers and grandmothers who are right there in front of them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Singers</h4><p begin="00:54:31.28" data-timestamp="3271.28"> (SINGING) Mama, I'm sorry for what I have done. I was arrested and ended up here in the Audy Home. Oh, I'm sorry for putting you through all of this.</p><p begin="00:54:50.80" data-timestamp="3290.8">I know you are mad about the good times that we missed. I'm ready to come back home. I'm willing to make a change.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:09.15" data-timestamp="3309.15"> One of the verses goes, "Mama, I'm sorry for making you come to court, for almost losing your job to give me moral support. Mama, I'm sorry for putting your through all this stress, for making you worry yourself and depressed. I'm ready to come back home. I'm willing to make a change."</p><p begin="00:55:25.94" data-timestamp="3325.94">And, by this time, the girls are all crying, the parents are all crying. And each girl has a cut-out little heart, like on Valentine's Day, like that, made from red construction paper, the size of your palm. And written on each one is the words, "I'm sorry."</p><p begin="00:55:45.53" data-timestamp="3345.53">And each girl goes out into the audience to where her mom is sitting, or her grandma is sitting, and hands her the heart. And the parents are crying, and the kids are crying, and everybody is hugging. It was really something.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Singers</h4><p begin="00:55:56.07" data-timestamp="3356.07"> (SINGING) --make a change. I'll do anything for you, mom. Please forget about yesterday. Mama, I'm sorry. [SNIFFLES]</p><p begin="00:56:14.69" data-timestamp="3374.69"></p><p begin="00:56:15.67" data-timestamp="3375.67">I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Mama, I'm sorry.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:18.81" data-timestamp="3378.81"> Here they were-- not just saying this to their mothers, but saying it publicly in front of the world, in front of their friends. Saying this thing that could be so hard to say in any case. Singing it out and hoping that it can heal something that is going to be hard to heal, no matter what you do.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Singers</h4><p begin="00:56:37.40" data-timestamp="3397.4"> (SINGING) Mama, I'm sorry.
