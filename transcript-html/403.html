  <h3>Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.61" data-timestamp="0.61">Today we  have this story for you about cars-- American cars. And like most stories about American cars lately, it's more tragedy than comedy, though there is some comedy in there, too. It's the story of a factory in California that captures pretty much everything that's gone wrong in the American car business in the last 30 years. And at the heart of the story is the question, why are American cars still not as good as foreign cars?</p><p begin="00:00:23.22" data-timestamp="23.22">Come with me for just a half minute to the Detroit Auto Show, OK? David Champion is one of the umpires who calls strikes and fouls in the car business. He's the senior director of <i>Consumer</i> <i>Reports</i> auto test division. He says that Ford has actually been improving for the last six or seven years, but Chrysler's still in the dumps, the worst of all the car makers they study, and as for America's biggest car maker, GM?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Champion</h4><p begin="00:00:44.41" data-timestamp="44.41">The big Achilles' heel with GM is their reliability. You look at things like the Cadillac CTS-- a fabulous car, I'd take a CTS over a BMW or a Mercedes any day. But unfortunately, the CTS has been poor for reliability since it was redesigned in 2007. So they still quite haven't got it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:07.09" data-timestamp="67.09">Why hasn't GM got it yet? It's not like this reliability problem just snuck up on them. It's been nearly 50 years since it started losing market share-- 50 years since it began the slide from holding over half the US car market, back in the '60s, to just 22% today. Here's an amazing fact. Even after Toyota's recent disaster with suddenly accelerating cars that killed possibly 52 people, <i>Consumer</i> <i>Reports</i> came out with new ratings just this month and it still rates Toyota as more reliable than all the American car makers.</p><p begin="00:01:37.60" data-timestamp="97.6">That's because the ratings are based on overall dependability-- the likelihood of whether you'll have a problem with your Toyota, and mostly, they are still very reliable cars. In fact, the top three automakers in the most recent <i>Consumer</i> <i>Reports</i> survey are all Japanese-- Toyota is number three-- and the top 10 are all foreign.</p><p begin="00:01:54.09" data-timestamp="114.09">Why is it taking so long for Detroit to figure out how to make a car as good as the Japanese? Well, there's some very interesting answers to that question, and all of them can be found right here-- at a car plant in Fremont, California, called NUMMI. NUMMI stands for New United Motor Manufacturing Incorporated.</p><p begin="00:02:15.28" data-timestamp="135.28">A modern car plant, by the way, sounds a lot like a casino. The automated gear plays little songs to let you know that it's running. Driver-less robot carts glide up and down the aisles, like R2D2, delivering doors and other parts. Their song is supposed to warn you that they're coming. The story of this factory is a famous one among car people-- it's taught at business schools.</p><p begin="00:02:33.84" data-timestamp="153.84">NUMMI was opened in 1984 by GM and Toyota together, who decided this would be a place that they would build cars with each other. If it seems strange to you that two competitors would do this, it seemed strange at the time, also. A headline in <i>Car</i> <i>and</i> <i>Driver</i> about the partnership read, &quot;Hell Freezes Over.&quot; But both companies had their reasons-- we'll get into that.</p><p begin="00:02:55.66" data-timestamp="175.66">At NUMMI, Toyota showed GM all its secrets-- exactly how it made some of the best built, most reliable cars in the world back then. GM hoped to take these lessons from NUMMI and carry them into all their other plants, all over the country, and all over the world. And then, well, that didn't go so well, and here we are today. GM went bankrupt. US taxpayers-- you and I-- bailed them out for $50 billion.</p><p begin="00:03:21.77" data-timestamp="201.77">And next week, the NUMMI car plant, the one that seemed like it might be able to teach American car makers how to catch up to their competitors, is going to stop making cars. It's happening, no joke, on April Fools' Day. Today we have a special story for you. We are devoting our entire show to it.</p><p begin="00:03:37.15" data-timestamp="217.15">For the last couple months, NPR's automotive correspondent, Frank Langfitt and one of our producers, Brian Reed, have been traveling around the country talking to GM workers and managers about what happened at NUMMI, and especially about what went wrong at GM that it had so much trouble for so long adopting the techniques it learned over a quarter century ago.</p><p begin="00:03:55.98" data-timestamp="235.98">General Motors and the UAW are secretive cultures, but as you'll hear, people were blunt when they talked to Frank-- blunt in a way that you rarely hear with auto executives and UAW reps when they're being interviewed by the press. Act one of our show is about the rise of NUMMI, act two is about what prevented GM from learning from NUMMI.</p><p begin="00:04:11.93" data-timestamp="251.93">From WBEZ Chicago, it's This American Life, distributed by Public Radio International. I'm Ira Glass. Our show today produced with our colleagues at NPR News. And now it is my pleasure to turn the story over to NPR automotive correspondent, Frank Langfitt.</p></div>  </div>

<div class="act" id="act1">
  <h3>Act One: Act One</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:04:27.33" data-timestamp="267.33">When NUMMI was conceived, General Motors was far and away the world's largest car company. Its US market share was seven times that of Toyota. But each company had a problem that the other company could help them solve. On GM's side, the problem was small cars. Under government emissions guidelines, General Motors had to build them, but they'd always lost money for GM, and they were lousy quality. So Toyota suggested a joint venture that offered two things. First, Toyota would build a quality small car for GM-- one that would finally turn a profit.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Liker</h4><p begin="00:04:58.90" data-timestamp="298.9">And the second thing was, we have this thing called the Toyota production system, and it produces the quality you see. We can teach you the Toyota production system.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:05:07.72" data-timestamp="307.72">Jeffrey Liker is a professor of industrial engineering at the University of Michigan. He wrote <i>The</i> <i>Toyota</i> <i>Way,</i> and he's been studying Japanese auto manufacturing-- including NUMMI-- since the 1980s. He says even though Toyota was offering GM something quite remarkable-- to teach a competitor its secrets, to show them exactly how Toyota achieved such phenomenal reliability-- GM wasn't that interested.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Liker</h4><p begin="00:05:29.31" data-timestamp="329.31">Some people in GM I think had some foresight to realize this is important. I think for many of the senior leaders, it was more, OK, well, maybe I'll learn something, maybe I won't, but it won't hurt.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:05:41.44" data-timestamp="341.44">Why wouldn't they be really interested in the Toyota production system, because at that point, wasn't Toyota building higher quality cars?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Liker</h4><p begin="00:05:48.15" data-timestamp="348.15">Toyota was building higher quality cars. I'm not sure it was 100% accepted at that time by senior management that Japanese quality was really better.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:05:57.10" data-timestamp="357.1">Why?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Liker</h4><p begin="00:05:57.77" data-timestamp="357.77">I think there was pride and defensiveness. I'm proud because I'm the biggest automaker in the world, I've been the best, I've dominated the market. You can't teach me anything, you little Japanese company.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Shook</h4><p begin="00:06:17.51" data-timestamp="377.51">I'm John Shook. Toyota in Toyota City was completely Japanese when I joined them. I was the first non Japanese to join them as a regular employee in Toyota City.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:06:27.32" data-timestamp="387.32">John Shook moved to Japan in the early 1980s because of his fascination with Japanese management techniques. He read books about them back home in east Tennessee. And he decided to fly halfway around the globe, learn to speak the language, and hunt for a job with the biggest Japanese company that would have him. Toyota hired him to train American workers in the joint venture.</p><p begin="00:06:47.17" data-timestamp="407.17">Now, here was the problem that pushed Toyota into the deal. They needed to learn how to build cars in America. For years, the Japanese had been winning away customers from Detroit, and the US Congress was threatening to restrict car imports. Toyota could avoid that by making cars in the US. But they wanted a partner. Here's John Shook.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Shook</h4><p begin="00:07:06.18" data-timestamp="426.18">Toyota was looking specifically for things they could learn. How can we work with American workers? How can we make sure that our management system can work in North America? And they'd been pretty happy just producing in Toyota City, doing a very good job, and the idea of actually taking their system and producing outside of Toyota City was scary to them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:07:25.20" data-timestamp="445.2">Toyota was right to be scared. Compared to Japan, where auto workers and management worked together, labor relations in America were more like war. And at the GM plant in Fremont, it felt at times like hand to hand combat.</p><p begin="00:07:38.18" data-timestamp="458.18">A former running back from the University of Arkansas named Bruce Lee ran the western region for the United Auto Workers, and was in charge of the Fremont Union Local 1364. Now normally, somebody like Bruce Lee is supposed to defend his union members no matter what. But even he says they were awful.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bruce Lee</h4><p begin="00:07:55.41" data-timestamp="475.41">It was considered the worst workforce in the automobile industry in the United States. And it was a reputation that was well earned. Everything was a fight. They spent more time on grievances and on things like that than they did on producing cars. They had strikes all the time. It was just chaos constantly.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Liker</h4><p begin="00:08:25.46" data-timestamp="505.46">The Fremont, California plant for General Motors was bad by GM standards, and GM's average was bad by Toyota standards, so this is the worst among the bad mediocre plants in GM.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:08:38.62" data-timestamp="518.62">Again, that's Jeffrey Liker, who's interviewed workers and management at Fremont for his research.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Liker</h4><p begin="00:08:43.50" data-timestamp="523.5">One of the expressions was, you can buy anything you want in the GM plant in Fremont. If you want sex, if you want drugs, if you want alcohol, it's there. During breaks, during lunch time, if you want to gamble illegally-- any illegal activity was available for the asking within that plant.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:09:01.19" data-timestamp="541.19">Sounds like prison.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Liker</h4><p begin="00:09:02.65" data-timestamp="542.65">Actually the analogy to prison is a good analogy. Because the workers were stuck there, because they could not find anything close to that level of job, and pay, and benefits, at their level of education and skill. So they were trapped there. And they also felt like, we have a job for life, and the union will always protect us. So we're stuck here, and it's long term, and then all these illegal things crop up so we can entertain ourselves while we're stuck here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rick Madrid</h4><p begin="00:09:30.90" data-timestamp="570.9">A lot of booze on the line. I mean, it was just amazing-- and as long as you did your job, they really didn't care.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:09:36.15" data-timestamp="576.15">What kind of booze, what were people drinking?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rick Madrid</h4><p begin="00:09:38.50" data-timestamp="578.5">Whiskey, gin.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:09:40.86" data-timestamp="580.86">That's Rick Madrid. He began working at the plant in 1955. He mounted tires on Chevy trucks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rick Madrid</h4><p begin="00:09:46.62" data-timestamp="586.62">When I was mounting tires, we'd drink. You know, I'd bring a thermos of screwdrivers with me. But I never was into drugs.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:09:56.79" data-timestamp="596.79">Sex?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rick Madrid</h4><p begin="00:09:58.84" data-timestamp="598.84">Love it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:10:00.43" data-timestamp="600.43">Did you ever have sex at the plant?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rick Madrid</h4><p begin="00:10:01.94" data-timestamp="601.94">Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:10:04.17" data-timestamp="604.17">Frequently?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rick Madrid</h4><p begin="00:10:05.82" data-timestamp="605.82">I wasn't that fortunate.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Peter Ross</h4><p begin="00:10:11.72" data-timestamp="611.72">There was a guy in there, he would be selling the pot.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:10:15.65" data-timestamp="615.65">Peter Ross repaired machinery on the assembly line at GM.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Peter Ross</h4><p begin="00:10:18.49" data-timestamp="618.49">I'd be walking through the plant with my tools and my radio. You see a big cloud of smoke, you don't want to inhale it, you'd get a contact high.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:10:34.33" data-timestamp="634.33">If you're wondering how people kept their jobs, well, back then the UAW was still quite powerful. Under the union contract, it was almost impossible to fire anybody, and if management ticked off the union, workers could just shut the plant down in minutes.</p><p begin="00:10:48.77" data-timestamp="648.77">With that sort of leverage, absenteeism became absurd. On a normal day, one out of five workers just didn't show up. It was even worse on Mondays. Billy Haggerty worked in hood and fender assembly. He says so few workers showed up some mornings, management couldn't start the line.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Billy Haggerty</h4><p begin="00:11:03.37" data-timestamp="663.37">They brought a lot of people off the street to fill in when they didn't have enough people.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:11:07.24" data-timestamp="667.24">Who would they find?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Billy Haggerty</h4><p begin="00:11:08.31" data-timestamp="668.31">Right across the street to the bar and grab people out of there and bring them in.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:11:12.52" data-timestamp="672.52">Workers filed grievances-- formal complaints against management-- over all kinds of things. Someone who isn't your boss asks you to clean something up? Hit him with a grievance. A manager steps in to do a job that isn't his? Grievance. The strategy was simple. Pile up grievances real or imagined by the thousands, then use them to squeeze money or concessions out of management.</p><p begin="00:11:33.76" data-timestamp="693.76">And Fremont workers struck back at their bosses in other ways. They'd intentionally screw up the vehicles. Put coke bottles or loose bolts inside the door panels so they'd rattle and annoy the customer. They'd scratch cars. Richard Aguilar inspected vehicles at the plant. He saw one guy do something even worse.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Aguilar</h4><p begin="00:11:52.39" data-timestamp="712.39">He left some loose bolts on the front suspension. That was dangerous. I went and told the system manager right away. They went out there and they checked, and there was like 400 cars he had done that to. He was mad because they had suspended him for drinking.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:12:12.17" data-timestamp="732.17">By 1982, GM had had enough and put the Fremont factory out of its misery. The company laid off thousands of workers and closed the plant. The next year, when GM and Toyota began planning to reopen the plant for the joint venture, there was one thing neither company wanted to do-- hire the same union leaders who'd battled management and overseen GM's worst workforce. Then the UAW's Bruce Lee sat down with chairman Eiji Toyoda.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bruce Lee</h4><p begin="00:12:38.57" data-timestamp="758.57">And one of the first things I said is, &quot;I've got to hire the first 50 people.&quot;</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:12:42.77" data-timestamp="762.77">So who did you hire?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bruce Lee</h4><p begin="00:12:44.60" data-timestamp="764.6">The same leadership that was in the union before.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:12:49.64" data-timestamp="769.64">Why? I thought you would try to get rid of them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bruce Lee</h4><p begin="00:12:51.60" data-timestamp="771.6">No, no, because I believed that it was the system that made it bad, not the people.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:12:57.83" data-timestamp="777.83">GM was against it, but incredibly, Toyota agreed. Toyota execs believed their system would turn bad workers into good ones. Then Lee had to sell the plan to the rank and file. He held a meeting and told union members that Fremont would now be a Japanese style plant. Old seniority rules wouldn't apply, life at the plant would be totally different. The workers hated all this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bruce Lee</h4><p begin="00:13:21.30" data-timestamp="801.3">They didn't want anything changed. They wanted the plant to open exactly how it was when General Motors had it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:13:27.85" data-timestamp="807.85">Bad cars and all?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bruce Lee</h4><p begin="00:13:29.61" data-timestamp="809.61">That's what they wanted.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:13:30.74" data-timestamp="810.74">They even hung Lee in effigy. But Lee had something very powerful on his side-- most of the workers desperately needed jobs, and Lee had them. When NUMMI opened, over 85% of the workforce were old hands from GM Fremont. But to prepare them for that moment, in the spring of 1984, Toyota started flying them to Japan in groups of 30 to begin learning the Toyota system for making cars.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Shook</h4><p begin="00:13:55.35" data-timestamp="835.35">Well, when the NUMMI workers first came to Japan, me, and certainly my Japanese bosses, had heard all these horrible things about the American worker, about the American union.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:14:03.61" data-timestamp="843.61">As the one American working in Toyota City, John Shook helped design this training.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Shook</h4><p begin="00:14:07.97" data-timestamp="847.97">We had certainly heard all these stories about the workforce there at the Fremont plant. And it was our job to show them a new, very different way of working. What would they do? How would they respond to this? How would they react? And no one knew. I didn't know. So everyone was very, very nervous.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Earl Ferguson</h4><p begin="00:14:23.64" data-timestamp="863.64">I was kind of apprehensive about what I was going to see when I arrived in Japan.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:14:28.32" data-timestamp="868.32">On one of those planes was Earl Ferguson. He'd been working for GM since 1964.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:14:33.28" data-timestamp="873.28">What were you apprehensive about?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Earl Ferguson</h4><p begin="00:14:35.42" data-timestamp="875.42">Whether they were going to accept us or not, you know. How they're going to react when the Americans landed in Tokyo. Everything was so new to us, you know, this is just a totally new experience.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Shook</h4><p begin="00:14:49.26" data-timestamp="889.26">So I will never forget--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:14:51.13" data-timestamp="891.13">Again, John Shook.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Shook</h4><p begin="00:14:53.04" data-timestamp="893.04">Taking a bus, a large bus, with my small group of Japanese colleagues to pick up the first group of trainees arriving from Fremont. Television cameras were there because this was big news in Japan at the time.</p><p begin="00:15:05.50" data-timestamp="905.5">[SPEAKING JAPANESE]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Shook</h4><p begin="00:15:07.35" data-timestamp="907.35">As they got off the plane, we had signs welcoming them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Earl Ferguson</h4><p begin="00:15:10.57" data-timestamp="910.57">The news media was everywhere. We were signing autographs and taking pictures with all the young kids. Totally new experience.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Shook</h4><p begin="00:15:19.93" data-timestamp="919.93">Most of them had never been out of the United States before. None of them, certainly, had ever been to Japan.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Les Myers</h4><p begin="00:15:28.98" data-timestamp="928.98">My name is Les Myers. I've worked at General Motors for 25 years. My hobbies are fishing and bowling.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Japanese Auto Worker</h4><p begin="00:15:39.62" data-timestamp="939.62">My name is [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]. My hobby's softball.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:15:46.03" data-timestamp="946.03">The narrator in this Japanese public television program points out that the American worker is nine years older than his Toyota trainer. He also notes for his Japanese viewers that the Americans are so much larger than the Japanese they waste a second or two more each time they get in and out of the vehicles they're building, which makes them 10 to 15% less productive than their Asian counterparts.</p><p begin="00:16:13.68" data-timestamp="973.68">The key to the Toyota production system was a principle so basic it sounds like an empty management slogan-- teamwork. Back home in Fremont, GM supervisors ordered around large groups of workers. The Takaoka plant, people were divided into teams of just four or five-- switch jobs every few hours to relieve the monotony. And a team leader would step in to help whenever anything went wrong.</p><p begin="00:16:36.49" data-timestamp="996.49">Again, Professor Jeffrey Liker and Toyota's John Shook.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Liker</h4><p begin="00:16:39.75" data-timestamp="999.75">And they spent about two weeks, and they worked in a Toyota plant.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Shook</h4><p begin="00:16:44.32" data-timestamp="1004.32">Hooked up at the hip with a counterpart in the Corolla plant-- someone who did the exact same job you would be doing back in Fremont.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Liker</h4><p begin="00:16:52.33" data-timestamp="1012.33">And they start to do the job, and they were pretty proud because they were building cars back in the United States, and they wanted to show they could do it within the time allotted, and they would usually get behind. And they would struggle, and they would try to catch up, and at some point, somebody would come over and say, do you want me to help? And that was a revelation, because nobody in the GM plant would ever ask to help.

This is the Japanese concept of <i>kaizen,</i> or continuous improvement.</p><p begin="00:18:27.97" data-timestamp="1107.97">And if you look around a Toyota plant, you can see the result of all those improvements. You see mats for workers to stand on, special cushions they throw into the car frames when they have to kneel inside, hanging shelves that travel along with the car and the worker, carrying parts and bolts they need within easy reach. Similarly, workers tasks have been streamlined to the fewest possible steps, each step timed down to the second.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Billy Haggerty</h4><p begin="00:18:51.95" data-timestamp="1131.95">Two seconds to pick up a bolt and put it on.

A car a minute don't seem like it's moving that fast, but when you don't get it, you're in the hole.

It's a thin nylon rope that hangs on hooks along the assembly line, which became a symbol of everything that was different about the Japanese way of making cars-- the andon cord.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Earl Ferguson</h4><p begin="00:22:29.84" data-timestamp="1349.84">These cords hanging down, that's the andon cord.

Workers in each area can pick the tune. You hear it all the time in a Toyota plant. The first pull doesn't stop the line, it summons team leaders to the location.

If you're just tuning in, we're in the middle of a story about a car plant in Fremont, California, called NUMMI. We now turn to the question, why was it so hard for GM to replicate NUMMI elsewhere in the company. In the first half of our story, we heard a lot from workers who are on the factory floor. In this half of the story, the action moves to their bosses-- the supervisors at GM, who had a chance to turn the company around with what they learned at NUMMI. Again, here's NPR's Frank Langfitt.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:31:15.66" data-timestamp="1875.66">GM had gotten the first thing it wanted out of NUMMI-- a high quality small car. Now the question was, how could it spread the lessons of NUMMI throughout the rest of the company? To do that, it set up a special liaison office. Managers were flown in for tours, to work the assembly line for a few days, to learn the team concept.</p><p begin="00:31:32.50" data-timestamp="1892.5">And from the beginning, GM executives sent 16 of their rising stars to help start NUMMI, with the idea that later they'd come home and change the company. Two <i>Wall Street</i> <i>Journal</i> reporters later dubbed them the NUMMI commandos. One of the 16 was Mark Hogan. He says the top brass understood NUMMI's game changing potential-- that a Toyota style plant squeezed many more cars out of far fewer workers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mark Hogan</h4><p begin="00:31:55.52" data-timestamp="1915.52">If General Motors was able to take its many manufacturing facilities and implement that production system, each of those little changes adds up to billions to General Motors in the bottom line.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Bera</h4><p begin="00:32:09.12" data-timestamp="1929.12">We were ready, we were fired, and we had the mental condition that says, we're going to do this, we're going to change the world.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:32:15.62" data-timestamp="1935.62">That's Steve Bera, another commando.

With no master plan from Detroit, the first real attempt to do NUMMI again came from a factory manager 400 miles south of Fremont, at a plant in Van Nuys. The factory was facing a possible shut down.</p><p begin="00:33:03.20" data-timestamp="1983.2">Its manager, a guy named Ernie Schaefer, had visited NUMMI, and he thought maybe he could save his plant if he adopted the Japanese system. But he didn't have all the advantages Fremont had-- this time, Toyota wasn't a partner in the experiment. GM had to transform Van Nuys on its own. Ernie Schaefer knew it was going to be tough.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ernie Schaefer</h4><p begin="00:33:20.65" data-timestamp="2000.65">The thing that I think kept us moving forward is we had no alternative.

Defective cars coming off the line, battles with the union, sabotage. So Ernie Schaefer enlisted the same UAW leader who got the union on board at NUMMI, Bruce Lee, to help him win over the Van Nuys workforce.</p><p begin="00:33:52.54" data-timestamp="2032.54">They shut down the plant for two weeks to train everyone in team concept and quality control.

Van Nuys hadn't been shut down. Turns out, it's a lot easier to get workers to change if they've lost their jobs and then you offer them back. Without that, many union members just saw the Toyota system as a threat.</p><p begin="00:34:46.98" data-timestamp="2086.98">And they had a point. Under the Japanese system, Van Nuys stood to lose a fourth of its workforce, because the more efficient a plant becomes, the fewer workers it needs. And just as bad, the team concept hurt their seniority rights. This had been a problem for union members back at NUMMI also.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Aguilar</h4><p begin="00:35:02.60" data-timestamp="2102.6">Seniority is what you work for.

He waited 15 years to get enough seniority for the job he'd always wanted in the plant. Under the new system, management could just hire someone off the street for that job. The whole idea of seniority placing you into one great job for years was impossible under the team concept.

You know, they'd point fingers, oh, he's not doing his job right, you know, or she's not doing the job right. And they would even keep track of the stuff they'd missed. Because that's what the company puts in them, that the only way you can protect your job, you have to keep the team strong, so if there's a weak link, you've got to get rid of that weak link.</p><p begin="00:36:19.10" data-timestamp="2179.1">And I would go tell them, you can't do that. You can't build a case for management against another union member.

Managers didn't like it either. They had their own privileges to protect. Some opposed the idea of stopping the assembly line because their bonuses depended on the number of cars that rolled off that line-- never mind how many defects they had.</p><p begin="00:36:53.03" data-timestamp="2213.03">And under the team concept, executives and workers all share the same cafeteria and parking lot.

So they have to walk 20 yards more.&quot; I said, &quot;Isn't that foolish that some grown man would come up and tell you, I'm going to quit if I can't have this parking place right here.&quot;</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:37:39.50" data-timestamp="2259.5">So people fought the new system from both sides. Managers gave Ernie grief, and a dissident faction sprang up in the local union, which elected a staunch opponent of the Japanese system as their chairman. And as if that all wasn't enough, Ernie Schaefer ran into another obstacle. Workers could only build cars as good as the parts they were given. At NUMMI, many of the parts came from Japan, and were really good. At Van Nuys, it was totally different.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ernie Schaefer</h4><p begin="00:38:05.42" data-timestamp="2285.42">That was perhaps one of our biggest failures, in that an isolated plant can't do this by itself.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:38:12.81" data-timestamp="2292.81">The team concept stressed continuous improvement.

All the departments in the company worked together.</p><p begin="00:38:25.33" data-timestamp="2305.33">But Ernie's suppliers had never operated in a system like that. If he asked for fixes, they blew him off. And if he called Detroit and asked them to redesign a part that wasn't working, they'd ask him why he was so special-- they didn't have to change it for any other plant, why should they change it for him?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ernie Schaefer</h4><p begin="00:38:40.75" data-timestamp="2320.75">You had asked the question earlier, what's different when you walk into the NUMMI plant?

I don't think, at that time, anybody understood the large nature of this system.</p><p begin="00:38:59.39" data-timestamp="2339.39">General Motors was a kind of throw it over the wall organization.

I think a lot of people were in denial, or just not willing to recognize it. And even though GM had gone from 50% market share in the early '70s, to mid 30s, it was gradual over time and there wasn't this sense of reaction or urgency that other companies that lost that much market share might have felt.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:43:21.15" data-timestamp="2601.15">Those exact numbers-- GM went from 47% of the US market in the mid 1970s to 35% a decade later. One reason car execs were in denial was Detroit's insular culture. Yes, unions and management were always at each other's throats, and yes, GM and its suppliers had a destructive relationship that seemed to almost discourage quality, but everyone had settled into comfortable roles in this dysfunctional system and learned to live with it. And in the late 1980s, with their market share in free fall, Jeffrey Liker says they were more apt to blame others than themselves.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Liker</h4><p begin="00:43:54.61" data-timestamp="2634.61">I worked with all the big three at the time, automakers, and it was common in all three automakers. They all believed that if the consumers think we have quality problems, it's because <i>Consumer</i> <i>Reports</i> is misleading them, and they're biased toward Toyota. They all believed that <i>Consumer</i> <i>Reports</i> was against them, that there was somewhat of a myth of Japanese quality.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:44:16.80" data-timestamp="2656.8">If all of that wasn't enough to stymie attempts to learn from NUMMI, GM was distracted by other projects-- massive projects. It bought Ross Perot's company, Electronic Data Systems. It bought Hughes Aircraft for $5 billion. It decided the future was robotics. It decided the future was a massive, costly reorganization. It started Saturn, which produced cars that were better marketed than they were built. Then came the 1991 recession-- car sales slumped. Again, Mark Hogan.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mark Hogan</h4><p begin="00:44:44.83" data-timestamp="2684.83">It was really its first significant wake up call. GM unfortunately had a massive loss, 1992-- General Motors lost more than $20 billion. So I think at that point in time, there was a complete rethinking of the way we ran the company-- that thing's had to change, and they had to change fast.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:45:05.66" data-timestamp="2705.66">It was the largest loss in American corporate history to that time-- $23.5 billion. GM's board of directors responded with what the press called a boardroom blood bath, purging a long list of managers. Jack Smith took over as CEO. He was the executive who'd led the negotiations with Toyota to create NUMMI. He saw NUMMI as a way forward for GM. Mark Hogan and some of the other commandos felt they finally had a champion.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mark Hogan</h4><p begin="00:45:31.14" data-timestamp="2731.14">Jack Smith was installed, and started to rapidly implement the Toyota production system into General Motors.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:45:38.28" data-timestamp="2738.28">Rapidly by GM's standards, which wasn't nearly rapidly enough. Jack Smith declined to talk to me for this story, but he told a reporter a few years ago, &quot;I just wish it had happened a lot faster than it did.&quot; Pick your nautical cliche-- reforming General Motors was like turning around a battleship, one manager said. Another compared it to steering the Titanic with a canoe paddle.</p><p begin="00:46:01.10" data-timestamp="2761.1">Jeffrey Liker says the cultural gap between NUMMI and the rest of GM was so vast that even with clear marching orders to change, some of the people running the company didn't know where to begin.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Liker</h4><p begin="00:46:10.95" data-timestamp="2770.95">There was no vocabulary, even, to explain it. So I remember, one of the GM managers was ordered, from a very senior level-- came from vice president-- to make a GM plant look like NUMMI. And he said, &quot;I want you to go there with cameras and take a picture of every square inch. And whatever you take a picture of, I want it to look like that in our plant. There should be no excuse for why we're different than NUMMI, why our quality is lower, why our productivity isn't as high, because you're going to copy everything you see.&quot;</p><p begin="00:46:46.12" data-timestamp="2806.12">Immediately, this guy knew that was crazy.

But there was no change in the culture. Workers and managers continued their old antagonistic ways. In some of the factories where they installed the andon cord, workers got yelled at when they pulled it. A few plants even cut the cords down.</p><p begin="00:47:18.06" data-timestamp="2838.06">So the second round of changes included some team concepts. They put together a book explaining how each plant should run, and the reasoning behind it. Geoff Weller was one of the people dispatched in the 1990s to convert the company plant by plant. Weller says some factory managers were receptive, but in the sprawling, decentralized system, the plant manager was still king and ran the factory the way he wanted.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Geoff Weller</h4><p begin="00:47:40.12" data-timestamp="2860.12">We had some tough goes in some of our facilities, where we spent more time trying to convince the plant leadership, versus actually going on and doing the implementation.

By the late 1990s, the company was posting huge profits selling trucks and SUVs, which made the loss in market share seem less urgent. To make real progress, managers had to leave the United States. One overhauled GM Germany. Mark Hogan took over GM Brazil in 1994 to enact NUMMI principles there.

By the year 2000, GM finally started to see a generational transformation.

But it was too late, and that's really sort of hard to forgive-- that if you take 30 years to figure it out, chances are you're going to get run over. And they got run over.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:52:36.56" data-timestamp="3156.56">In the end, what did them in was the 2008 recession.

Just any kind of piece of crap they could roll out there, they did. And they paid a tremendous price for it, and even when they turned the corner in quality, people didn't trust them.

Because they don't trust them.</p><p begin="00:53:49.97" data-timestamp="3229.97">But had they adopted and embraced the team concept in an honest way-- we're going to do this-- I think it might have dramatically changed what happened in the American auto industry.

Instead, they bet the company on SUVs and trucks, only to see sales crash when gas hit four bucks a gallon.</p><p begin="00:54:45.39" data-timestamp="3285.39">One odd twist to this story-- over the last decade, as GM became more like Toyota, Toyota became a little bit like GM. In 2008, they took over the title from GM of the world's largest car maker. But Toyota executives now say the company did this by making one of GM's old mistakes-- stressing quantity over quality.</p><p begin="00:55:06.16" data-timestamp="3306.16">Akio Toyoda is the company's CEO. He's the grandson of the founder, and he cut his teeth at NUMMI.

And all the time, the NUMMI plant kept pumping out vehicles-- 6,000 a week on average, two shifts a day. Toyota got what it wanted out of the deal. A year after starting NUMMI, it began opening other factories around the US using what it had learned in Fremont.</p><p begin="00:56:06.40" data-timestamp="3366.4">GM and Toyota continued to run NUMMI together, until 2009 when GM went bankrupt and pulled out, leaving Toyota to run the plant alone. Now Toyota has decided to pull out of the plant. It's their only unionized plant in the United States. Next Thursday, NUMMI will produce its very last car, a Corolla. 4,500 people will lose their jobs. This is the first factory Toyota has shut down since it was founded 73 years ago.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Shook</h4><p begin="00:56:32.88" data-timestamp="3392.88">Toyota is not perfect. GM is not perfect. But I think anyone who touched NUMMI will never forget it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:56:39.86" data-timestamp="3399.86">One last time, that's John Shook, the first American Toyota hired for NUMMI.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Shook</h4><p begin="00:56:44.34" data-timestamp="3404.34">It does represent something that was special at a point in time. It was a laboratory. My learning curve, it wasn't just a curve, it was a 90 degree right angle. I loved every minute of it. And almost every one, I think you'll talk to, who worked on NUMMI will say the same thing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rick Madrid</h4><p begin="00:57:05.96" data-timestamp="3425.96">I'm so fortunate that I ended my career in the auto industry at NUMMI.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:57:11.34" data-timestamp="3431.34">Rick Madrid retired from the assembly line in 1992.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rick Madrid</h4><p begin="00:57:14.22" data-timestamp="3434.22">I just hate to see the plant close-- oh, that just hurts me. End of an era. It changed my life from being depressed, bored-- and like my son said, it changed my attitude. It changed me all for the better. I really hate to see it go.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Billy Haggerty</h4><p begin="00:57:32.53" data-timestamp="3452.53">I look at cars, and I see a lot of the cars that we built.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:57:36.62" data-timestamp="3456.62">That's Billy Haggerty, who ended up putting in 18 years at NUMMI without a vacation day. He says just the other day he saw one.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Billy Haggerty</h4><p begin="00:57:43.88" data-timestamp="3463.88">I just seen a-- what was it-- '86, '87 Corolla, pulled in right over around this corner here. I was heading for the bank, and I just looked at it, said, boy, that one's old. I looked down, it was a Corolla. I know we built it, right there. It's still running. It's still kicking. It feels good.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:58:10.23" data-timestamp="3490.23">This is also NUMMI's legacy. In the end, it's not just a symbol for so many things that went wrong with GM. It's also a really good car plant-- one that turned out nearly 8 million high quality cars and trucks.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:58:29.40" data-timestamp="3509.4">Frank Langfitt is NPR's automotive correspondent.</p><p begin="00:59:05.59" data-timestamp="3545.59">Frank Langfitt's story about NUMMI was produced by me and Brian Reed.
