  <h3>Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.85" data-timestamp="0.85">OK, Sarah. So it's ten to 1:00 on a Friday night in November, and we're sitting on your porch. And it seems pretty quiet.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:00:14.33" data-timestamp="14.33"> It's not that bad.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:15.48" data-timestamp="15.48"> One of the producers of our radio show, Sarah Koenig, moved to a college town because her husband got a job teaching there. And by day, her neighborhood is like a college town that you would see in an old Hollywood film. Beautiful professors' homes built in the '20s and '30s. Tree-lined streets. Gardens.</p><p begin="00:00:32.27" data-timestamp="32.27">But by night, we'd been on her porch for five minutes when--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Sarah  Koenig</h4><p begin="00:00:36.47" data-timestamp="36.47"> They seem drunk. These kids seem drunk. This couple here, they're sort of staggering a bit. I think he's like holding her up or something.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:46.35" data-timestamp="46.35"> It's nine students walking down the middle of the street. Happens all the time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah  Koenig</h4><p begin="00:00:50.43" data-timestamp="50.43"> It's noisy, right? It's like it doesn't occur to them at all, I think, that there are people just in these houses trying to sleep. And I kind of remember being that way in college, too, actually.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:04.71" data-timestamp="64.71"> Yeah, I do too.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:01:05.75" data-timestamp="65.75"> Six minutes later, there's another group of drunk students. One tosses something onto a lawn.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:01:10.49" data-timestamp="70.49"> Can you guys pick up your trash, please? Can you pick up your plate, your pizza plate, please? People live here.</p><p begin="00:01:19.23" data-timestamp="79.23">They pay no attention.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:21.25" data-timestamp="81.25"> Five minutes after that, we hear this clattering from the alley that runs next to Sarah's house.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:01:26.12" data-timestamp="86.12"> Whoa, what was that? Actually, I'd kind of like to know what that was.</p><p begin="00:01:30.17" data-timestamp="90.17">What's going on?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:31.22" data-timestamp="91.22"> We run down the alley. Two college boys run away as they see us coming. Don't go back there, you could get raped, they yell to Sarah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Sarah  Koenig</h4><p begin="00:01:38.44" data-timestamp="98.44"> See, OK. They get threw somebody's trashcan, or like drop kicked it up in the air.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:45.31" data-timestamp="105.31"> 12 minutes after that, from the other direction, we hear a scraping and a loud rumbling, I guess.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:01:52.06" data-timestamp="112.06"> That's somebody's property. That might have been a sign, actually.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:57.14" data-timestamp="117.14"> I don't know how many street signs you need to hear dragged through your neighborhood before you can recognize the sound it makes from all the way around the corner, but apparently my colleague Sarah has seen whatever that number is. We go to investigate and find two guys.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:10.33" data-timestamp="130.33"> So just describe what you've got here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Student 1</h4><p begin="00:02:12.01" data-timestamp="132.01"> A stop sign.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Student 2</h4><p begin="00:02:13.40" data-timestamp="133.4"> Nice big pole on it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Sarah  Koenig</h4><p begin="00:02:15.70" data-timestamp="135.7"> A stop sign. That's kind of a big thing when you see it up close, isn't it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Student 1</h4><p begin="00:02:19.33" data-timestamp="139.33"> Sorry.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:02:20.51" data-timestamp="140.51"> Where did you find that? Like, where does it belong?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Student 1</h4><p begin="00:02:22.57" data-timestamp="142.57"> I don't know.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Student 2</h4><p begin="00:02:23.79" data-timestamp="143.79"> That is a good question.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Student 1</h4><p begin="00:02:25.04" data-timestamp="145.04"> We just found it on a lawn. We found it on a lawn.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:02:27.06" data-timestamp="147.06"> Oh, you found it on someone's lawn.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Student 2</h4><p begin="00:02:28.21" data-timestamp="148.21"> It was already ripped off.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Student 1</h4><p begin="00:02:29.48" data-timestamp="149.48"> Yeah, it was already [BLEEP].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Student 2</h4><p begin="00:02:30.98" data-timestamp="150.98"> We just decided, hey, why not make use of it and take it?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:33.47" data-timestamp="153.47"> Of course, this story makes no sense at all. I inform the two guys that I don't need to know their names.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Student 2</h4><p begin="00:02:38.69" data-timestamp="158.69"> Well, in that case, we took it from the corner right there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:02:40.70" data-timestamp="160.7"> Which one?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Student 2</h4><p begin="00:02:42.83" data-timestamp="162.83"> Where that car just turned. Pretty sure.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:45.88" data-timestamp="165.88"> Pulled it out of the ground?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Student 2</h4><p begin="00:02:46.81" data-timestamp="166.81"> Yeah, it was cemented in pretty well. Just get a little rocking back and forth between two people, comes right up.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:53.39" data-timestamp="173.39"> Did you guys come from like a house party somewhere?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Student 2</h4><p begin="00:02:56.95" data-timestamp="176.95"> No. We were just hanging out with a bunch of friends, just drinking. Taking some shots.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:01.63" data-timestamp="181.63"> Seems like kind of an academic distinction to me, but.</p><p begin="00:03:05.87" data-timestamp="185.87">With that, the other guy starts running with the street sign toward Garner Street, which is hard, because it's attached to a seven foot metal pole, and it's heavy. Sarah and I go back around the corner to her front yard. The evening is not over at all. Just in time to spot another student, this one coming out of a garden. Sarah assumes from the bushes back there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Student 3</h4><p begin="00:03:23.22" data-timestamp="203.22"> I didn't pee.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:03:24.75" data-timestamp="204.75"> Really? Really?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Student 3</h4><p begin="00:03:26.61" data-timestamp="206.61"> I was just sitting down.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:27.79" data-timestamp="207.79"> He goes. And it's not a minute later that Sara points toward the alley, where there are three girls in miniskirts, under a streetlight, fully visible.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:03:36.67" data-timestamp="216.67"> Peeing, peeing, peeing, peeing, peeing. [INAUDIBLE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:39.90" data-timestamp="219.9"> One girl hikes up her skirt.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:42.45" data-timestamp="222.45"> Get back, get back, get back.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:03:43.80" data-timestamp="223.8"> But they're peeing in my yard. They're peeing in my yard. That's my car, OK, and three feet back is a girl's white ass, peeing.</p><p begin="00:03:53.30" data-timestamp="233.3">She saw we saw her. She stopped. She stopped.</p><p begin="00:03:58.34" data-timestamp="238.34">You know, that might be why the plants grow really, really well in that spot, I'm just realizing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:02.19" data-timestamp="242.19"> Sarah's caught other groups of girls peeing in that same spot. Once she heard a girl say, "This is a good place. I go here all the time."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:04:08.90" data-timestamp="248.9"> They're so embarrassed. There's like, muffled giggling happening across the street.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:13.52" data-timestamp="253.52"> The college town that Sarah lives in is State College, Pennsylvania, home of Penn State University, which this year was named the number one party school in the country by the people who name the number one party school, the Princeton Review. And this is apparently what it means to be the number one party school. From the moment that Sarah and I turned on the tape recorder to the moment that she sent those girls looking for somebody else's yard to pee in, it's only been 34 minutes. It's 1:30 in the morning.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:04:38.41" data-timestamp="278.41"> The fact that we saw that much mayhem sort of going on, at one corner-- so that means it's, multiply that by, you know, this entire neighborhood and other neighborhoods around-- people are peeing everywhere, garbage cans are getting kicked, stop signs are getting pulled out of the road, people are littering. You know.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:57.73" data-timestamp="297.73"> The Princeton Review chooses the number one party school from online student surveys. 120,000 students at 371 schools around the country answered these questions. "How widely used are beer, alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs at your school?" "How big is frat life at your school?" And finally, "How many hours do you study each day?"</p><p begin="00:05:18.90" data-timestamp="318.9">Students aren't randomly selected, so it's not, strictly speaking, a scientific survey. But the last two years, Penn State has done very well. It was the number three party school last year, number six the year before that, and nobody argues it is not a very big school for partying.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Graham Spanier</h4><p begin="00:05:32.33" data-timestamp="332.33"> Well, look. We've never said we don't want our students to have fun.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:38.94" data-timestamp="338.94"> The University's president, Graham Spanier, discussed the number one ranking in a faculty senate meeting this fall. The only recording that exist is from a webcast Penn State did at the meeting, so you hear the audio is little sketchy. But still fine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Graham Spanier</h4><p begin="00:05:51.71" data-timestamp="351.71"> I mean, when people talk about oh, Penn State's a party school, I'm not-- it doesn't bother me at all, actually. I wish we weren't ranked number one.</p><p begin="00:06:03.68" data-timestamp="363.68">You know why we're ranked number one? Have we talked about this? You know why we're ranked number one? The students vote! It's not like somebody came in here and did an assessment of the place. It's an online, web-based thing. And whenever there's an online, web-based thing, Penn State always wins. We have the best mascot in the country. We probably do. But I guarantee that any online voting for the best mascot in the country, we're going to win that. You know? We're the number one university on Facebook. We're the number one university with Twitter.</p><p begin="00:06:40.99" data-timestamp="400.99">So when these party school things, some of our students get online and vote? Of course they want to be voted number one. Yeah, Penn State. Then I have to clean up the mess after the votes are in. Because I got all the donors and alumni, and the media I'm calling for comment.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:57.57" data-timestamp="417.57"> The amount of drinking at the school does concern Spanier. He told the faculty that when people ask him what's the biggest problem at Penn State, they always expect him to say money, but the answer for a long time has been alcohol.</p><p begin="00:07:07.92" data-timestamp="427.92">And he said it's a problem that's bigger than Penn State. Nearly a third of high school seniors across the country binge drink.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Graham Spanier</h4><p begin="00:07:13.86" data-timestamp="433.86"> So it's a bit of a problem that we inherit. But we also have a cultural environment here, an atmosphere that fosters it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>       Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:24.02" data-timestamp="444.02"> Well, today we devote our entire show to the nation's number one party school. Not because it's number one and what happens here is unusual, but because it's not unusual at all. Lots of schools, especially a lot of big state schools, do this much partying.</p><p begin="00:07:41.91" data-timestamp="461.91">Five of us from our staff went down to State College where Sarah lives to record one football weekend in November. What we bring you today is a travelogue from this place where the rules and norms are probably very different from where you live right now. Its own rituals, its own jargon, its own native dress. We wanted to see what it was all about.</p><p begin="00:07:57.78" data-timestamp="477.78">Our show today, in four acts. Only three of them actually pre-soaked in vodka. From WBEZ Chicago, it's This American Life, distributed by Public Radio International. I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.</p><p begin="00:08:10.67" data-timestamp="490.67"></p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One: I'm Not As Think As You Drunk I Am</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:26.72" data-timestamp="506.72">Act One. I'm Not As Think As You Drunk I Am.</p><p begin="00:08:30.89" data-timestamp="510.89">Let's start with the drinking, which is epic. The Harvard School of Public Health did a study of what schools tend to have the heaviest drinking, and Penn State actually hits all the criteria that they found. It's located in the northeast, and it has a large undergraduate population-- that would be, in this case, 44,000 students-- a large fraternity system, a nationally-known football team.</p><p begin="00:08:49.38" data-timestamp="529.38">Now, the fact is that it probably doesn't hurt it's isolated. State College is in a valley nestled between two mountain ridges in a state forest. People here call it "Happy Valley." It's surrounded by farms. You're in the middle of nowhere, a few people said, without much to do but drink.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:03.47" data-timestamp="543.47"> And to talk about this drinking, I'm joined now in the studio by Sarah Koenig. Because Sarah, you recorded these first couple clips of tape.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:09:08.98" data-timestamp="548.98"> Right. A couple of weeks before you guys came to State College, there was this huge freak snowstorm, and they had to cancel tailgating for the first time anyone could remember because the conditions were so dangerous by the field. But it didn't stop anyone. I saw people tailgating in their yards, on their front lawns. Even in my neighborhood, I saw people under, like, these building underpasses.</p><p begin="00:09:31.70" data-timestamp="571.7">I went into a parking garage and found all these people on the fourth floor. There's dirty cars everywhere. Concrete floor. It's cold, it's dark. At the end of one row of cars, there were these two tables pushed together in an L-shape tablecloths, and all kinds of food, and a couple of birthday cakes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:09:49.13" data-timestamp="589.13"> Whose birthday is this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Student 1</h4><p begin="00:09:50.24" data-timestamp="590.24"> It's my birthday! It's my birthday! My 21st birthday.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:09:53.83" data-timestamp="593.83"> Happy birthday!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Student 1</h4><p begin="00:09:54.67" data-timestamp="594.67"> Thank you!</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:09:56.01" data-timestamp="596.01"> And what are you doing on the fourth floor of a parking garage?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Student 1</h4><p begin="00:09:59.41" data-timestamp="599.41"> I'm getting drunk and tailgating.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah  Koenig</h4><p begin="00:10:02.11" data-timestamp="602.11"> Describe your headgear there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Student 1</h4><p begin="00:10:05.20" data-timestamp="605.2"> It's a crown with a 21 that's on fire, and it says "Where is the bar?"</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:10:09.58" data-timestamp="609.58"> So who brought all this food?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Student 1</h4><p begin="00:10:12.30" data-timestamp="612.3"> My mom and dad, because they love me, and they're the best.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:10:16.05" data-timestamp="616.05"> About a half dozen older people were there, too. Her parents and some of their friends. And there were a bunch of other tailgates happening around us, and one couple was having their 40th wedding anniversary.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:25.88" data-timestamp="625.88"> Wow. In the garage?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:10:27.58" data-timestamp="627.58"> In the garage, yeah. At one point, a women probably in her 50s walked up and handed the birthday girl a red plastic cup.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Student 1</h4><p begin="00:10:35.95" data-timestamp="635.95"> Aw, thank you! What is this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:10:38.46" data-timestamp="638.46"> [UNINTELLIGIBLE] Lemonade.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Student 1</h4><p begin="00:10:40.00" data-timestamp="640"> Is there alcohol in it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:10:42.07" data-timestamp="642.07"> Most definitely.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female  Student  1</h4><p begin="00:10:43.84" data-timestamp="643.84"> Oh my God! This is the strongest drink I've ever had in my life. They just brought me a really strong alcoholic lemonade.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:10:57.01" data-timestamp="657.01"> Is that your daughter, are you the mom?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:10:58.95" data-timestamp="658.95"> No, no.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:10:59.48" data-timestamp="659.48"> Oh.

It's entire families. It's several generations together. It's outdoor, public drinking, which gives you the feeling, when you're there, that the whole world is drinking. Probably because there's so much of it.</p><p begin="00:11:41.10" data-timestamp="701.1">Penn State now has the largest stadium in North America. It holds over 100,000 people. The tailgates are these huge masses of humanity, spread out as far as you can see, all around the stadium. Starting at eight in the morning, starting really early, which is when these alums got here.

But the main thing about this kind of drinking, where it's tied in with tradition, and football, and family, and overwhelming sense of school spirit, is that it feels incredibly wholesome. The whole campus feels like a Chevy commercial. Welcoming, people friendly. [UNINTELLIGIBLE]</p><p begin="00:13:06.19" data-timestamp="786.19">The sense that drinking together is what we do spills over from the football games into the whole weekend. Into the week, too, actually. It's Friday night, it's the night before the football game, outside East Hall, the big freshman dorms. Dozens of kids are lined up for free shuttle buses that are going to take them across campus to the frats and parties on the other side.</p><p begin="00:13:25.37" data-timestamp="805.37">Two of our producers, Jane Feltes and Lisa Pollak, noticed that all the girls wore these ratty-looking hoodies and jackets over their dressup clothes.

All the girls had on pretty much the same thing. Like some version of a mini, mini, mini tube dress, bare legs, and super high platform heels.

The surveys show that every Friday and every Saturday night, 75% of the school drinks. That's over 30,000 people, an average of four and a half drinks per person. And the students drink those drinks in about three hours average.</p><p begin="00:15:20.78" data-timestamp="920.78">To put those numbers in perspective, binge drinking, or as it's being re-branded lately, high risk or dangerous drinking, defined as four drinks for a woman or five drinks for a man consumed in just two hours.</p><p begin="00:15:34.37" data-timestamp="934.37">[SINGING]</p><p begin="00:15:35.30" data-timestamp="935.3">When you get down into the details of Penn State's numbers, it works out to over half the students regularly binge drinking, which is just a little bit above the national average for college students.</p><p begin="00:15:51.44" data-timestamp="951.44">[SINGING]</p><p begin="00:15:54.40" data-timestamp="954.4">The routine at Penn State on weekend nights is that you pregame or preload.

We heard lots of people use the phrase "beer jacket."</p><p begin="00:16:10.75" data-timestamp="970.75">And if you went to college long ago, you definitely noticed mostly hard liquor here, not beer.

A senior named Dan was out late one of these weekend nights, not drinking, but watching drunk people and taking notes for a paper that he's writing. He decided to quit his fraternity after his sophomore year because he was falling so far behind in the school work. His frat threw parties not two, not three, but four nights a week, which is typical here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dan</h4><p begin="00:20:40.31" data-timestamp="1240.31"> Every Thursday, Friday, Saturday, huge parties. Something every Wednesday. And then all the other days, something going on. You know, come in from a day of class, and you know, my three or four best friends are all playing beer pong, for instance. It got to the point where I was like, this isn't a good place for me to be to achieve. You know, there are nights that I'd have to wear my headphones to try to study because it would be so loud, and just live in the library most of the time. You know, I've had to cut the circuit breaker on people's rooms before, because it's four AM and they won't turn off their music. And you see fights. You know, I've seen people sent to the hospital for things as petty as, you knocked my drink out of my hand. I saw a kid stop breathing from alcohol poisoning. It's all-- it's amazing, the things that go on there. That it operates legally, I find, is incredible.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:21:40.66" data-timestamp="1300.66"> In the surveys of students done by the school, a fourth of Penn State students say that drinking has caused them to miss class get behind with their school work. 15% say they've been pushed, hit, or assaulted. 7% said drinking lead to an unwanted sexual experience. 6% said they'd gotten into what you would call a real, physical fight. And there are crimes that you never hear of unless you live in a place like State College.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nina White</h4><p begin="00:22:03.54" data-timestamp="1323.54"> Our daughter came into the kitchen while we were in the midst of hurriedly getting everything done and said something to the effect of, Mommy, I want to play in my room. Can you please get that man out of my bed? And I remember having said something to the effect of, there's no man in your bed. And she actually went away and came back a few minutes later. So I guess she went up to check, and she comes down. There is a man in my bed, and I want to play in my room. Would you please get him out of there?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:22:28.37" data-timestamp="1348.37"> This is a long time State College resident named Nina White.

He came to her house drunk, found a comfortable place, and fell asleep.</p><p begin="00:22:41.12" data-timestamp="1361.12">Because of incidents like this, the population at Penn State who seem the most exercised about student drinking right now is local residents who live near the students. They've been organizing and trying to pass new laws. Some of them admit that dealing with so many drunk kids so many months in a row has turned them into something that they are not proud to be. One neighbor, Laird Jones, told me he knows it's driving him a little batty.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Glaird Jones</h4><p begin="00:23:01.25" data-timestamp="1381.25"> I don't know if you heard when you came in, but I have motion sensors out there.

I mean, I was walking home with my son on Sunday, past the frat house up the street. And for fun, they were throwing furniture off the roof. Which is actually kind of fun. It's just, when it all hit the ground, they got out lighter fluid and soaked it and lit it on fire. In a yard full of dry leaves ten feet away from a parked car.</p><p begin="00:24:07.19" data-timestamp="1447.19">And I thought to myself, you know, should I call?

Just about every business owner and employee I talked to said business was significantly down because of Penn State's loss to Ohio State the week before. But at the dry cleaner, no mention of this.

When it's late, simplify.</p><p begin="00:30:04.24" data-timestamp="1804.24">Every Friday and Saturday night after midnight, when the drink specials at the bars are over, Canyon Pizza starts getting a loud, amped-up line of students down the block. The business model at Canyon Pizza is straight-up, no-frills genius. Slices are a dollar a piece. After 11 PM, it's cheese only. And every time the pretty women behind the counter get a tip, they hit a giant tip gong.</p><p begin="00:30:31.35" data-timestamp="1831.35">Canyon Pizza also delivers until four in the morning on weekends, and the deliveries are a whole separate world, deserving their own business tip. So tip four-- be aware of fists and wings.</p><p begin="00:30:44.97" data-timestamp="1844.97">One of the delivery guys is Alex Moore.

He's studying game simulation and computer programming at DeVry online. Look closely at his hoodie. It's Pac-Man.</p><p begin="00:32:25.57" data-timestamp="1945.57">Pizza delivery has been a good job while he's finishing up his degree. The only food Alex says he doesn't like to deliver is wings. Canyon Pizza has a sister store, Canyon Wings, and Alex says that mysteriously, people don't tip for wings. He says most of the time he gets a dollar or nothing at all. Just stiffed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Moore</h4><p begin="00:32:44.52" data-timestamp="1964.52"> Which is a bummer.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:32:45.50" data-timestamp="1965.5"> On wings.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Moore</h4><p begin="00:32:47.09" data-timestamp="1967.09"> Yeah.

Keep it cheap.</p><p begin="00:33:07.14" data-timestamp="1987.14">In Pennsylvania, beer is only sold in certain stores. It's not sold in grocery stores, and it's not sold in the places that sell liquor and wine. This is just how Pennsylvania does things. It's been this way since the end of Prohibition.</p><p begin="00:33:18.80" data-timestamp="1998.8">So Paul Pletcher owns Pletcher's, one of the beer stores in State College. It's a family business. Paul's father lured him away from teaching middle school math. And over the last 15 years or so, Paul has witnessed a strange trend in student drinking-- the ascendance, and eventual dominance, of light beer. As Paul remembers it, it went from Coors Light to Miller Lite to Bud Light and now--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Pletcher</h4><p begin="00:33:42.35" data-timestamp="2022.35"> The most popular beer in State College right now I believe is Natural Light. It's inexpensive and very popular among the students.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:33:51.34" data-timestamp="2031.34"> Natural Light, aka Natty Light, is way beyond "very popular" among Penn State students. It laps every other beer. Even though apparently no one likes it, including the students at Pletcher's who are buying it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Student 1</h4><p begin="00:34:04.12" data-timestamp="2044.12"> It's pretty bad.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:34:05.58" data-timestamp="2045.58"> But you have three cases of it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Student 1</h4><p begin="00:34:07.11" data-timestamp="2047.11"> Well, it's not for me. It's for my friends.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy  Updike</h4><p begin="00:34:09.13" data-timestamp="2049.13"> Only in college can you show up with a beer your friends know is bad and still be a hero. Natty Light's sole virtue-- this is according to its own customers-- is that it's cheap. $16.50 a case at Pletcher's. No one, not a single person I talked to, liked the taste.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Student 2</h4><p begin="00:34:27.05" data-timestamp="2067.05"> It's terrible.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:34:28.69" data-timestamp="2068.69"> This group of students said that at their party and tailgate, they would have the six cases of Natty Light they were buying, plus another favorite drink, Jungle Juice, which is also--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Student 2</h4><p begin="00:34:38.78" data-timestamp="2078.78"> Oh, it's horrible. It's like a lot of Hawaiian Punch, orange juice, pineapple juice, and then two handles of Vladimir Vodka, which is the worst vodka you can possibly get. That's what I lived on freshman year. It's terrible.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:34:53.41" data-timestamp="2093.41"> So basically I'm getting a picture of Penn State that you spend 70% of your time drinking things that you find absolutely repulsive.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Student 2</h4><p begin="00:35:03.66" data-timestamp="2103.66"> Yeah.

Like your customers.</p><p begin="00:35:29.15" data-timestamp="2129.15">There's a bar just up the street from Canyon Pizza called The Brewery. It's a dive. Literally. It's in a basement. The main owner is Ray Rocky who grew up in Pennsylvania and went to Penn State undergrad and grad school. He started tending bar as a student.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ray Rocke</h4><p begin="00:35:42.94" data-timestamp="2142.94"> When I got the business like 17, 18 years ago, we were probably 80%, 85% beer in sales over the bar. Now we're probably 80% to 90% liquor.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:35:52.11" data-timestamp="2152.11"> It's completely shifted.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ray Rocke</h4><p begin="00:35:53.50" data-timestamp="2153.5"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:35:54.03" data-timestamp="2154.03"> Ray says there are many reasons for this tectonic change in student drinking habits. He says beer is at a disadvantage at the University generally since Penn State banned kegs at fraternities, dorms, and tailgates.</p><p begin="00:36:06.77" data-timestamp="2166.77">And Ray says in his experience, promotional reps for liquors like Bacardi or Captain Morgan do a lot more on-site promotions, giving away T-shirts and such, than beer labels do. And the promotions work. They push sales toward liquor.</p><p begin="00:36:21.39" data-timestamp="2181.39">There's also lots of liquor now that's flavored-- more fruit punch than bourbon. And Ray says the 21 year olds he sees in his bar seem to come in already much more used to drinking liquor than beer. It mixes well with soda or red bull, and it's easier to hide.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ray Rocke</h4><p begin="00:36:35.71" data-timestamp="2195.71"> You know, you get a flask of Captain Morgan, you get the bottles, the plastic bottles, I don't know if you've seen them, they're shaped like a flask. You could put one of them in your pocket. You can't carry a case of beer in your pocket.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:36:44.74" data-timestamp="2204.74"> The result of more liquor and less beer, according to Ray?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ray Rocke</h4><p begin="00:36:48.38" data-timestamp="2208.38"> Before, I'd say, 15 years ago, there were more people that got drunk. But now there are less people getting drunk, but of the ones that get drunk, they're a lot worse.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:36:58.87" data-timestamp="2218.87"> So Ray does see students getting what he calls "stupid drunk." But most don't do that, he says. Like a lot of the business owners I talked to, Ray likes that the students are having a good time. He likes the students, period.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ray Rocke</h4><p begin="00:37:13.50" data-timestamp="2233.5"> They're fun to be around. You know? I mean, they're all young. The energy level. You can't help but be in a good mood when you come in and everybody is-- you know, these people don't really have what I would call real problems, you know, in the real world problems, or outside the bubble that is State College.</p><p begin="00:37:31.83" data-timestamp="2251.83">You go into a bar, and people have real issues. You know, they're going through divorces, they're going through problems at work. I mean, talk to any college kid, they figure they've got their life ahead of them, they're going to make big money, they're going to change the world, they're going to do everything they want. The world hasn't kicked them in the ass yet. They haven't been beaten down, whatever you want to call it.</p><p begin="00:37:47.48" data-timestamp="2267.48">Will they get a little mouthier than they should? Sure. But I'd rather have a student that has a little bit of an edge to him than a bunch of people that hate the world, and they're just not happy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira  Glass</h4><p begin="00:38:00.51" data-timestamp="2280.51"> Nancy Updike.</p></div>  </div>

Murder and other serious crimes are almost nonexistent.</p><p begin="00:38:28.37" data-timestamp="2308.37">But as you've heard, of course, that doesn't mean that the streets are quiet. There's so much activity that 47% of the town's budget go into police services, which is high for a town this size. On the Saturday night that we were in town, 24 officers were on duty patrolling in cars, on bikes, on foot. And that's just to cover the town. The University has its own police force patrolling the campus. One of our producers, Aaron Scott, rode along with one of the town's officers for the night shift.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aaron Scott</h4><p begin="00:38:50.43" data-timestamp="2330.43"> Officer Martin Hanes tells me the job's all about repetition.

And usually at 4 after is when get our drunk kid in the house.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aaron Scott</h4><p begin="00:39:18.83" data-timestamp="2358.83"> Drunk kid in the house.

So I yelled at her to get out of car or she was going to be arrested, she got mad and she went to the back of my car when I started pulling in. I heard a loud thump. She punched me around the side. I got out of the car, and she started trying to run away, and her two friends got in front of me and started pushing me back, telling her to run.</p><p begin="00:44:58.86" data-timestamp="2698.86">Center county, 3261. 10-8.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Aaron  Scott</h4><p begin="00:45:02.73" data-timestamp="2702.73"> By 4 AM, the streets are empty.

  <h3>Act Four: A Drinking School With A Football Problem</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:46:09.26" data-timestamp="2769.26">Act Four. A Drinking School With A Football Problem.</p><p begin="00:46:36.19" data-timestamp="2796.19">The big reason anybody worries about all the drinking at Penn State, of course, is it's dangerous. Every year, 1,700 college students across the country die of alcohol-related injuries. The average amount of alcohol in college students' blood when they come into the local emergency room in State College is steadily rising each year. It's now at 0.252, three times the legal limit at which you can drive a car. The head of the emergency department told me that it's a level that normal drinkers can't even usually get to because they'd throw up, fall asleep first.</p><p begin="00:47:03.30" data-timestamp="2823.3">What's interesting, if you ask Penn State administrators about what they're doing to deal with all the student drinking, they're not defensive. I met the head of University Relations with the school, the guy who's responsible for making the school look good to the public, and he was right upfront about it. Yeah, he said, drinking is a terrible problem, and we have tried everything we can think of to fix it, twice.</p><p begin="00:47:22.27" data-timestamp="2842.27">Which is actually more or less true. The school has spent millions attacking this problem. They've tried to teach the students, in all kinds of ways, about safer drinking. They created alcohol-free halls and dorms, they created a task force, there have been town-gown commissions, they've mounted a huge program of alcohol-free late night activities. The weekend we were there, that included comedian Patton Oswalt for free for students, free movies, a Halo tournament.</p><p begin="00:47:46.11" data-timestamp="2866.11">Obviously this hadn't gotten the job done. Sarah Koenig explains why this problem is just so hard for university administrators to fix.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:47:52.54" data-timestamp="2872.54"> The first university president in the country to take on excessive drinking in a very public way was Graham Spanier when he arrived at Penn State 15 years ago. At a time when most schools didn't want to talk about it, he was relentless. Here he is in his 1998 State of the University speech.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Graham Spanier</h4><p begin="00:48:08.27" data-timestamp="2888.27"> To put it succinctly, let me say to all high school students. If you are interested in Penn State because of the attraction of binge drinking, please go somewhere else.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Sarah  Koenig</h4><p begin="00:48:22.67" data-timestamp="2902.67"> The message didn't always go down well. A month after this speech, Spanier was booed by students at a football game. A local bar ran an ad depicting him as Hitler, speaking with a German accent and sending storm troopers to raid a fraternity. He got pushback from alumni, a University trustee, even the local ACLU, who all said this wasn't an issue for a university president.</p><p begin="00:48:50.90" data-timestamp="2930.9">After 1998, he stopped hammering the topic so publicly, he says, in favor of working on it more behind the scenes. Ask the people behind the scenes today how it's going, and they'll tell you they're losing ground.</p><p begin="00:49:02.56" data-timestamp="2942.56">Linda Lasalle is the administrator in charge of educating Penn State students about the dangers of alcohol. Some of her work happens in the classroom.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Linda Lasalle</h4><p begin="00:49:09.00" data-timestamp="2949"> And I talk about how our data shows that most of our students actually have five or fewer when they drink. Or we had data they showed that a few years back. And students would laugh at me! They would say, oh, you know, none of my friends drink that little. We're all drinking eight, nine, ten. So this higher level of consumption to them is the norm.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:49:30.12" data-timestamp="2970.12"> For ten years, Linda Lasalle's office has taught kids about blood alcohol levels and alcohol poisoning. They administer a mandatory online alcohol education program for incoming freshman called AlcoholEdu. They did a social norms media campaign aimed at changing students' behavior by teaching them that most students drink less than they think. Lasalle heard the plastic drinking cups they handed out became popular for beer pong.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Linda Lasalle</h4><p begin="00:49:52.16" data-timestamp="2992.16"> No real success. We're seeing some tremendous knowledge gains from students who participate in the program. Our preliminary data shows that there's no significant behavior change, however.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Sarah         Koenig</h4><p begin="00:50:08.28" data-timestamp="3008.28"> So armed with all these facts about what alcohol can do to you, students here seem to drink just as much as they always did.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:50:20.97" data-timestamp="3020.97"> It's just, it must feel so defeating.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Linda Lasalle</h4><p begin="00:50:23.16" data-timestamp="3023.16"> It does. It feels very defeating. I have very conflicting feelings about it. Because I feel like there's not very much we can do, that there are so many things that contribute to this problem that are out of our control. And you know, at the same time, I also feel like I want to be able to do something. No college student should ever die because they simply had too much to drink.</p><p begin="00:50:47.84" data-timestamp="3047.84">So I guess I don't have a good answer. I don't know what would really make a difference, especially in this campus.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah  Koenig</h4><p begin="00:50:59.32" data-timestamp="3059.32"> Is that hard for you to say, as someone who has your job?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Linda Lasalle</h4><p begin="00:51:04.63" data-timestamp="3064.63"> Yeah. It's very difficult to say.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:51:06.82" data-timestamp="3066.82"> This worst case scenario, a student dying, was on everyone's mind this fall, because it happened in September, just a month after school started. Maintenance workers found the body of Joe Dado at the bottom of an outdoor stairwell. Dado had been missing for a couple of days after he left a frat party alone at 3:30 in the morning. It seems he'd been climbing on top of a wall between two classroom buildings and fallen on his head. He was a freshman, just 18 years old.</p><p begin="00:51:37.65" data-timestamp="3097.65">At other schools, the administration has sometimes used these sorts of deaths to push for change. In 2004, after a 19 year old sophomore at Colorado State named Samantha Spady was found dead of alcohol poisoning at the Sigma Pi frat house. The frat house was shut down, and all other fraternities banned alcohol. Alcohol sales were banned inside the football stadium, and her parents started a foundation in her name. MIT, Indiana University, University of Virginia all reacted with sweeping changes after alcohol deaths.</p><p begin="00:52:05.44" data-timestamp="3125.44">Here, the immediate reaction to Dado's death from senior administration was remarkable for its gentleness. Nobody hollered at the students to quit drinking so much. Rather, the message was, if you're going to get plastered, do it more responsibility. Graham Spanier issued a statement telling students to, quote, "Remember our commitment to one another's safety." Damon Simms, vice president of Student Affairs, told students at a meeting that he hoped the entire student body would double their efforts in watching out for each other.</p><p begin="00:52:31.47" data-timestamp="3151.47">Maybe they figured this message had a better chance of sticking, and it did stick. The lesson students have taken is not that Dado drank too much, but that he would be alive today if only he hadn't been alone.</p><p begin="00:52:42.53" data-timestamp="3162.53">My colleague Lisa Pollak talked to freshmen at the student union here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Student 1</h4><p begin="00:52:45.86" data-timestamp="3165.86"> We've become more responsible. Nobody goes home alone anymore. We call each other, make sure we're doing OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Student 1</h4><p begin="00:52:51.73" data-timestamp="3171.73"> My friends, we all try to stay together a lot more, and don't leave anybody out by themselves late at night. Like even if they say they're fine, you're like, no. You're not fine.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:53:00.42" data-timestamp="3180.42"> OK. This might sound like a really silly question, but did any of you think to say, well, why don't we just not drink anymore?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Female  Student 1</h4><p begin="00:53:07.36" data-timestamp="3187.36"> No, we didn't say that. But yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:53:11.54" data-timestamp="3191.54"> It seems to be the perennial lesson of these accidents. After a drunk girl fell from a sixth story window in 1997, this was the story in the local newspaper. Quote, "The death of a Penn State student at a party a week ago may prompt partygoers to keep a closer eye on each other's safety, students say. But, they add, the accident probably won't change their drinking behavior." Penn state students also fell to their deaths in 1993, 1987, 1984, 1983.</p><p begin="00:53:39.63" data-timestamp="3219.63">The averageness of what killed freshman Joe Dado is exactly why this is such a challenge for administrators. To Penn State students, the amount Dado drank that night is completely normal. After questioning his friends, police reported that Dado drank several shots of vodka and mixed drinks in his dorm, the whole pregaming thing, and then got on the shuttle bus with his friends. They went to a frat called ATO, played beer pong, drank four or five cans of Natural Light each. Then they went to Fiji, another frat, where Dado did a couple shots of whiskey. By the end of it, his blood alcohol level was high, but not crazy high. It was a third less than the average for kids brought to the emergency room for alcohol.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Townsend</h4><p begin="00:54:17.07" data-timestamp="3257.07"> It was just a normal night. It wasn't like overindulgence. It wasn't like a ridiculous, wild party.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:54:25.71" data-timestamp="3265.71"> The last person to talk to Dado that night was Jack Townsend, a 21 year old junior. He gave Dado those shots of whiskey at Fiji, and he's been criminally charged with providing alcohol to a minor, along with the frat.</p><p begin="00:54:38.49" data-timestamp="3278.49">Townsend was a friend of Dado's. He played soccer with him in high school. He took one of his sisters to the prom. He told producer Lisa Pollak that when he looks back at that night, it's hard for them to reconcile that something so ordinary led to something so terrible.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Townsend</h4><p begin="00:54:51.75" data-timestamp="3291.75"> So I thought, you know, nothing of it that night. You know, it's just a friendly drink. Based on the things I heard from the entire timeline of that night, I mean, it reminded me of my freshman days. The same thing, you know?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:55:06.01" data-timestamp="3306.01"> And that you drank even before you go out?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Jack  Townsend</h4><p begin="00:55:09.17" data-timestamp="3309.17"> Yeah, yeah. I mean, none of that was shocking to me. None of that was really surprising to me. It was typical weekend night for a freshman. I have thought about how, like, how didn't I realize how dangerous some of this stuff could have been before it happened.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:55:26.06" data-timestamp="3326.06"> Because it hadn't really struck you before?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Townsend</h4><p begin="00:55:27.90" data-timestamp="3327.9"> Yeah. Because nothing ever really bad ever came from it until now.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:55:32.15" data-timestamp="3332.15"> Joe Dado's case fits neatly into a variety of depressing data sets. Researchers know, for instance, that the bingiest of the binge drinkers are white male freshmen, and even if he wasn't binging, there's the fact that most bad things happened early on in the school year. The alcohol ER admissions here for September are much higher than for the rest of the year, for instance. He drank Vladimir vodka that night, the most widely sold liquor in State College, and was hanging out with fraternity members, who tend to drink more than non-Greek students.</p><p begin="00:56:01.19" data-timestamp="3361.19">Bob Saltz, a senior research scientist at the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, says here's what's counterintuitive about managing drinking on college campuses and why so few are having success. He says that while your heaviest drinkers are of course at the highest risk of getting hurt or hurting somebody else, there aren't that many of them. So you really also need to be worrying about the light and moderate drinkers, who vastly outnumber the heavy drinkers. Kids like Joe Dado, who might only overdo it once in a while.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Saltz</h4><p begin="00:56:27.90" data-timestamp="3387.9"> Even though at any given time, most of the students are going to have an easy time of it, no one's going to get hurt, we just don't know who it is who's going to get hurt over a large population. But the concern many administrators have, and some students as well, is that it seems somehow wrong to impose a strategy that's universal, because again, the holdover concept that we really should be only focusing on the heaviest drinkers.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:56:56.01" data-timestamp="3416.01"> Saltz's strategy for reducing risk to the biggest population of students is so simple that I missed it the first time he said it. You reduce risk by limiting kids' access to alcohol. The less alcohol is available, the less kids drink. The less they drink, the fewer bad things happen. In practice, what this means is a police crackdown, and just as importantly, the perception of one.</p><p begin="00:57:17.68" data-timestamp="3437.68">The problem with this strategy has been that there was hardly any campus-wide research to back it up, until now. Saltz is about to publish the results of an NIH-funded study he did at 14 California campuses. At half of them, cops went on party patrols, broke up large off-campus parties. They stepped up DUI enforcement and enforced laws against sales to minors at bars. And most important, they heavily publicized this stepped-up enforcement to students so they would start self-policing, rather than risk getting busted.</p><p begin="00:57:46.23" data-timestamp="3466.23">By the end of the study, Saltz found that fewer kids were getting drunk. The campuses where they cracked down reported 6,000 fewer drunk students coming from off-campus parties, and 4,000 fewer coming from bars.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Saltz</h4><p begin="00:57:56.64" data-timestamp="3476.64"> And we were able to show that increased controls on off-campus drinking did not lead to any displacement of those problems somewhere else, which is what people assume, is that if you do a better job at off-campus parties, that students will just go to a park, or back to the dorms, or some other place, and that the level of problems will stay the same. And I was happy to see that that did not happen in our case.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Sarah  Koenig</h4><p begin="00:58:20.79" data-timestamp="3500.79"> Saltz says sprawling university bureaucracies usually aren't well-suited to this kind of tough guy strategy. For one thing, they're run by educators, who tend to think they can simply teach kids to drink less. But when I asked him if there's any university out there that's having real, on-the-ground, sustained success, he immediately says yes. University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Their drinking reduction stats are the envy of the student affairs world.</p><p begin="00:58:47.08" data-timestamp="3527.08">Starting in 1998, the school teamed up with the city of Lincoln and declared an all-out war on out of control drinking-- a data-driven, goal-oriented war. Not only did they do the kind of police crackdown Saltz advocates, they attacked the problem from every possible angle, enlisting of bar owners, state legislators, liberal arts students, business students, high school principals. They lobbied to digitize Nebraska's driver's license to stop rampant fake IDs. They tried to knock down the average number of drinks on a student's 21st birthday from 14 to 7.</p><p begin="00:59:18.61" data-timestamp="3558.61">Linda Major, Assistant to the Vice Chancellor at UNL, was the general in this war from the beginning. She says breaking up wild parties in residential neighborhoods was one of the most controversial things they did early on. Also, one of the most effective.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Linda Major</h4><p begin="00:59:30.79" data-timestamp="3570.79"> And over the course of time, the wild party patrol really went out very few weekends, but people believed that it could happen any weekend, and so behavior was naturally curbed.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Sarah   Koenig</h4><p begin="00:59:48.35" data-timestamp="3588.35"> Major sensed the place felt different, and every statistical indicator backed up that feeling. There were far fewer neighbor complaints about parties. Students reported studying more, getting more sleep. Fewer people dropped out, and there were fewer reports of unwanted sex or driving drunk. Way more freshmen were abstaining from alcohol. And binge drinking numbers sank from 63% of students in 1997 down to 42% in 2007.</p><p begin="01:00:17.62" data-timestamp="3617.62">The frustration for Penn State is that it follows the same research as UNL, and does a lot of the same things. It has as many alcohol programs and interventions as any university in the country.</p><p begin="01:00:27.83" data-timestamp="3627.83">But one researcher told me that the problem is almost no colleges, Penn State included, properly evaluate what they're doing, so they really don't know what works and what doesn't. This work is tricky. There's so many variables that just because something works at one school doesn't mean it'll work the same way someplace else.</p><p begin="01:00:44.88" data-timestamp="3644.88">Still, it's clear Penn State has not done what UNL did-- joined with the town and declared total war. At least not recently. There's no shortage of complaints about the university's efforts. Why won't it ban alcohol from the dorms, or take on the widespread underage drinking, or punish students more harshly, expel them, even, when they break the law?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Damon Simms</h4><p begin="01:01:03.83" data-timestamp="3663.83"> We need to do things differently. Everything that once upon a time was not open to reconsideration needs to be open to reconsideration.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="01:01:13.02" data-timestamp="3673.02"> Luckily, the one person at Penn State agitating for a complete overhaul of the University's drinking reduction strategy happens to be the guy in charge of them-- Damon Simms. He's the new vice president for Student Affairs, and he's not messing around. When he rattled off a list of recent meetings he's had on the topic, it was almost comical in its scope. The town manager, the editor of the local newspaper, the borough council, student government, town and university police, faculty, fraternity leaders, on and on.</p><p begin="01:01:40.21" data-timestamp="3700.21">Simms thinks being named number one party school and the death of Joe Dado have pushed the issue to some kind of tipping point, and he plans to capitalize on it. He's working on a list of ideas. When we met, it was 72 items long.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Damon Simms</h4><p begin="01:01:51.46" data-timestamp="3711.46"> And there are some sacred cows that need to be reconsidered, too.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="01:01:56.13" data-timestamp="3716.13"> He says that includes grade inflation, troublesome fraternities, and out-of-control tailgating. Simms will be proposing a bunch of new initiatives early next September, including new sanctions for students who break alcohol laws.</p><p begin="01:02:08.74" data-timestamp="3728.74">Already fraternities have new rules. No more Wednesday night parties. On other nights, photo ID required for entry, and professional bouncers at the door.</p><p begin="01:02:18.50" data-timestamp="3738.5">But what you hear all the time around here, off the record, from local residents, from faculty, from other administrators, is that Spanier really can't, or won't, do anything more draconian about the drinking problem here. Make fraternities dry, say, or curb tailgating. Because politically, he simply cannot risk alienating those secret cows Simms is talking about. Especially alumni and athletics, meaning football, which brings in enormous money.</p><p begin="01:02:42.85" data-timestamp="3762.85">Tens of thousands of alumni come to football games, rent skyboxes-- the only places in the stadium where you can drink, by the way. They arrange their lives around the season. It's a big part of why they give money to the school. Last year, alums and other donors gave $182 million.</p><p begin="01:02:57.25" data-timestamp="3777.25">I asked Spanier if there was something he needed to be careful about here in terms of the connection between football and donors and booze.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Graham Spanier</h4><p begin="01:03:05.15" data-timestamp="3785.15"> No. I don't buy that at all. That's just speculation that you hear from people like, oh, that must be part of the issue. They would never go after the alumni. The fact is, what happens with six or seven home games is not the heart of this issue here. We're talking about weekend in, weekend out, every day of the week, throughout the year kind of issues.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="01:03:28.23" data-timestamp="3808.23"> When this comes up, it's sort of like, well, someone will say, why don't they just make tailgating dry, you know, no alcohol on university property? Is that kind of thing ever even brought up as like a, we just want to signal a culture change? We're just going to make a big bold move and say, we're going to become a different kind of school now? Is that ever on the table?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Graham Spanier</h4><p begin="01:03:47.97" data-timestamp="3827.97"> No, I don't think so. I can't envision telling alumni of legal age that they can't drink on a football weekend, and seeing that that's going to change the problem of alcohol consumption among underage students on college campuses. I don't think those two things are really tied together.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>            Sarah      Koenig</h4><p begin="01:04:15.75" data-timestamp="3855.75"> One bright spot Spanier sees is that there's been a shift at Penn State since he started talking about this 15 years ago. Now for the first time academic deans and faculty leaders and student leaders are wanting to talk about this, saying they want to help.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Graham Spanier</h4><p begin="01:04:39.76" data-timestamp="3879.76"> That is a sea change from what we saw in an earlier era.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="01:04:44.60" data-timestamp="3884.6"> Do you feel optimistic?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Graham   Spanier</h4><p begin="01:04:47.07" data-timestamp="3887.07"> No. I wouldn't say I feel optimistic. I feel like we just have to keep working on it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah       Koenig</h4><p begin="01:04:56.24" data-timestamp="3896.24"> Joe Dado's death, he said, won't have any meaning to next year's freshmen. That's what makes universities like any other enterprise. Every year, the student body turns over by the thousands, so every year, he and his staff have to start all over again.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>     Ira   Glass</h4><p begin="01:05:17.87" data-timestamp="3917.87"> Sarah Koenig.</p><p begin="01:05:28.81" data-timestamp="3928.81">Here's something else you need to know before we close this hour. People love Penn State. Students were spontaneously telling all of us how much they love the school, how they never want to college experience to end. They chant the school chant, "We are Penn State," not just in the football stadium-- in the student union, shuttle bus, out of the blue. They say "we are Penn State" in conversation, to make a point. They're part of this club that they're really excited to be part of. This feeling gets its purest expression at football games, where they're a hundred thousand strong, screaming together, but it permeates the school.</p><p begin="01:06:01.88" data-timestamp="3961.88">I went to the game when we were there with two juniors, Megan Koch and Zach Fliegel. Megan's Nittany Lions memories include the night of her high school homecoming, which was also the 2005 Michigan game. She was all dressed up. Her dad was on the cell phone.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Megan Koch</h4><p begin="01:06:14.59" data-timestamp="3974.59"> He was calling me, telling me, you know, play by play what was going on. And he's like, you're not going to believe this, but Michigan just scored and we lost with two seconds left on the clock. And I remember I just hung up the phone and I was like, oh my gosh. I started like crying.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="01:06:29.35" data-timestamp="3989.35"> For Zach, it's also about the past and the future. On our way to the stadium, we passed some little boys in the tailgate.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zach Fliegel</h4><p begin="01:06:35.04" data-timestamp="3995.04"> I used to be that kid, throwing the football around in between cars and stuff.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira  Glass</h4><p begin="01:06:39.02" data-timestamp="3999.02"> Lions played, Lions won. It was the last home game of the year, and seniors down in the first row were crying. Zach said even a bad game, being in the stadium, in the student section, was worth it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zach Fliegel</h4><p begin="01:06:51.00" data-timestamp="4011"> I live for this. I'll probably be coming here until I'm old and wrinkled.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="01:06:56.34" data-timestamp="4016.34"> Really? So like 50 years from now, where will you be sitting? Point to the spot.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zach  Fliegel</h4><p begin="01:07:00.28" data-timestamp="4020.28"> Hopefully in WC, WD on the 30, 40 yard line, maybe?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="01:07:05.90" data-timestamp="4025.9"> Show me the seats where you want?</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="01:07:07.66" data-timestamp="4027.66"> And he pointed a third of the way up, 30 yard line. I went around to his friends in the student section. Nobody hesitated. 50 yard line, skybox, 30 yard line. Look for them. 2059. They all want to come back.</p></div>  </div>
