Johanna's eight, in third grade. Again, Mae's six, first grade. And Johanna, as the older sister, is very aware of the things that make Mae upset.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Johanna</h4><p begin="00:01:23.00" data-timestamp="83"> Mostly, when I tell her what to do.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:26.53" data-timestamp="86.53"> Especially, she says, when it comes to what Mae is wearing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Johanna</h4><p begin="00:01:30.52" data-timestamp="90.52"> Like, she thinks fashion disasters are, like, the worst thing ever to happen. So she gets really angry when I tell her what to wear. And yeah, Mae gets very angry a lot. And her face turns red, and yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:47.68" data-timestamp="107.68"> Here's Mae.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mae</h4><p begin="00:01:48.61" data-timestamp="108.61"> I was, like, so frustrated. I had a big tantrum.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:53.62" data-timestamp="113.62"> What do you do when you have a tantrum?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mae</h4><p begin="00:01:56.08" data-timestamp="116.08"> I usually do this with my fist.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:59.02" data-timestamp="119.02"> You're scrunching your fist as tight as they can go.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mae</h4><p begin="00:02:00.76" data-timestamp="120.76"> Yeah. Mm-hmm. And I was, like, jumping and jumping and twitching my legs.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:06.90" data-timestamp="126.9"> Meanwhile, Mae and Johanna's mom, Megan, was trying to get them both dressed and ready for school.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Megan</h4><p begin="00:02:12.55" data-timestamp="132.55"> And I just remember she was screaming, because I said, OK, Mae, you got to calm down so you can still get ready and get out the door. And she was just screaming that the only way she could calm down was if she punched her sister in the face.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mae</h4><p begin="00:02:23.56" data-timestamp="143.56"> I told my mom, that's the only way for me to calm down.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Megan</h4><p begin="00:02:27.09" data-timestamp="147.09"> And I said, well, that's not an option. So can you think of some other way to calm down? And then, I had to get ready, so I just left, and she was still kind of making quite a bit of noise. And then, when I came back, kind of miraculously, the tears had dried. She was smiling. Johanna was smiling.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:44.68" data-timestamp="164.68"> What had happened? How did these two little kids work this out so quickly? Well, Mae and Johanna explained, it went down like this. Mae marched herself to Johanna's room and banged on the door. Johanna opened the door. And Mae has been working on not giving in to her anger, not taking the low road, but instead, using words, saying what she wants, which she did now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mae</h4><p begin="00:03:09.54" data-timestamp="189.54"> I said, I want to punch you in the face, and that's the only way I can calm down.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:16.85" data-timestamp="196.85"> And then, Johanna, what did you say?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Johanna</h4><p begin="00:03:20.19" data-timestamp="200.19"> Um, I want to kind of think about that.</p><p begin="00:03:24.11" data-timestamp="204.11">[IRA LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:03:25.89" data-timestamp="205.89"></p><p begin="00:03:26.78" data-timestamp="206.78">Um, you can punch me in the butt instead.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:33.14" data-timestamp="213.14"> This caught Mae off guard.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mae</h4><p begin="00:03:35.55" data-timestamp="215.55"> I was like, OK. And then, I just tried it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:40.16" data-timestamp="220.16"> When you punched her butt, did you punch her like you were super mad? Or did you punch her kind of soft by then, because you were, sort of, half over it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mae</h4><p begin="00:03:48.39" data-timestamp="228.39"> I punched-- I punched it hard. Because, like-- so, like, to try to get all the anger out. Because if I punched it softly, it sort of-- it sort of only lets a couple pieces of the madness out of you.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:05.49" data-timestamp="245.49"> And did it work? Did you get all the anger out?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mae</h4><p begin="00:04:08.18" data-timestamp="248.18"> Yes, because I punched it super hard.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Johanna</h4><p begin="00:04:11.87" data-timestamp="251.87"> She definitely hit it very hard.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:14.93" data-timestamp="254.93"> How was that for you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Johanna</h4><p begin="00:04:17.75" data-timestamp="257.75"> Um, I'm used to having a lot of siblings, and I get beat up by them all the time. So it didn't really hurt me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:30.71" data-timestamp="270.71"> Why did that work?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mae</h4><p begin="00:04:33.20" data-timestamp="273.2"> I don't know. [CHUCKLES]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:35.12" data-timestamp="275.12"> It's funny. I wonder if it worked because she was sort of nice about it. Like, you came to her all mad, and then she didn't get mad back. Instead, she greeted your anger with niceness.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mae</h4><p begin="00:04:52.61" data-timestamp="292.61"> I don't really know why she acted nice to me when I was frustrated.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:59.20" data-timestamp="299.2"> Have you ever heard of this phrase, "turn the other cheek"?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mae</h4><p begin="00:05:02.95" data-timestamp="302.95"> No.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:03.88" data-timestamp="303.88"> It's something that I think Jesus said. He said that if somebody slaps you on your right cheek-- like, you know, slaps you on the cheek of your face-- he says, turn the other cheek, and offer the other cheek as well. Even if somebody's mad at you and does something unreasonable, you shouldn't get unreasonable yourself.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mae</h4><p begin="00:05:22.72" data-timestamp="322.72"> Probably.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:24.25" data-timestamp="324.25"> And in this case, your sister turned the other cheek, but it was her butt cheek that she turned.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mae</h4><p begin="00:05:31.87" data-timestamp="331.87"> [CHUCKLES] That's funny.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:37.42" data-timestamp="337.42"> But it wasn't just Johanna who led them to a quick, peaceful resolution. Both girls agree that if Mae hadn't asked for what she wanted at the door, if she just punched Johanna, Johanna would have punched back. It would have escalated. Johanna admits she's not always so calm and reasonable with Mae. But this time, it was clear how to handle her, and Johanna knew exactly what to do.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Johanna</h4><p begin="00:05:58.78" data-timestamp="358.78"> And she got what she wanted, so I think that made her happy.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:03.27" data-timestamp="363.27"> I think that's true.

So there's an entire genre of movies and other stories, where tough guys who have been through it all and seen the worst in people decide they're going to soften, try a little tenderness, help somebody out who needs the help. This happens in old westerns, sci-fi films, spy stories.</p><p begin="00:07:54.58" data-timestamp="474.58">And there's a story like that on stage right now, on Broadway in New York. And I saw this a couple of weeks ago and thought, this story would be perfect for the radio. And the director and producers and writers said, yes. The show is called <i>All</i> <i>In.</i> And it stars John Mulaney, Richard Kind, Fred Armisen, and Chloe Fineman.</p><p begin="00:08:12.83" data-timestamp="492.83">And what they're doing is they're performing a set of short stories on stage by the writer Simon Rich, who's been on our show a few times with his stories. And let's get right to it. This story is one of the stories in their show. It's called "The Big Nap."</p><p begin="00:08:28.74" data-timestamp="508.74">[TYPEWRITER KEYS CLACKING, CARRIAGE RETURN]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Detective</h4><p begin="00:08:32.20" data-timestamp="512.2"> Chapter one. I woke up just after dawn. It was a typical morning. My knees were scraped and bruised. My clothes were damp and soiled. And my teeth felt like someone had socked me in the jaw. I reached for the bottle I kept under my pillow and took a sloppy swig. The taste was foul, but it did the trick. Now, I could sit up and think. Now, I could start to figure out how to somehow face another goddamn day. I stared at my reflection in the mirror. I wasn't getting any younger. I was two years old.</p><p begin="00:09:09.15" data-timestamp="549.15">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:09:11.25" data-timestamp="551.25">Soon, I would be three, unless I stayed two.

  <h3>Act Two: The Gladiator Starring Ruffled Crow</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:26:38.57" data-timestamp="1598.57"> It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Today on our program, "Try a Little Tenderness," we have stories of people putting aside aggressiveness and anger and disappointment in other human beings, and reaching out in kindness instead. We've arrived at Act Two of our program. Act Two, The Gladiator, starring Ruffled Crow. Aviva DeKornfeld brings us this story about a person who tried to be considerate and where it got him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:27:04.26" data-timestamp="1624.26"> This story starts with a little tenderness. Alan Martin's a real nature lover, spends as much time as possible hiking around the mountains and bird-watching near his home in Vancouver. So it pained him when he had to cut a big tree down in his front yard. Because he didn't want to disturb any of the animals living in it. But the tree was starting to rot, and he was afraid it would fall onto his house.</p><p begin="00:27:26.79" data-timestamp="1646.79">And so like the sensitive environmental scientist that he is, Alan waited until autumn, when he knew that nesting season was over. And then, just to be extra careful, he brought in an arborist to assess the tree to make sure he wouldn't be messing with any little critters' homes. He got the OK and hired a couple guys to cut the tree down while he stood by, directing them this way and that. And then, the next morning, Alan stepped out of his house, and--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan Martin</h4><p begin="00:27:55.85" data-timestamp="1675.85"> There was this crow sitting in the front lawn, and at a close distance to the steps. And it's just staring right at me. [CHUCKLES]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:28:03.89" data-timestamp="1683.89"> That's very weird.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan Martin</h4><p begin="00:28:05.60" data-timestamp="1685.6"> It was a bit off-putting. I couldn't quite figure it out, but I walked down my path. And as soon as the crow was out of my sight, that's when I got this thump on the back of my head.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:28:16.04" data-timestamp="1696.04"> Out of the corner of his eye, Alan saw the crow fly past him. And he thought, did that crow just hit me? It hurt.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan Martin</h4><p begin="00:28:25.55" data-timestamp="1705.55"> And then I did a few little experiments. I would turn away purposely and walk away, and it would leave the power line, attending another hit. And I would turn around just in time, and it would swoop away. And I did this a couple of times. It was just clearly waiting for me to turn away, so that it could hit me in the back of the head.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:28:43.81" data-timestamp="1723.81"> Alan thought, OK, maybe this crow didn't live in this tree, but it must have meant something to it. He knew that crows are really smart, but they're also very vengeful birds and territorial. And so a short while later, when he walked out of his house--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan Martin</h4><p begin="00:29:02.30" data-timestamp="1742.3"> I came out, and there was a crow sitting on the line. But it was a different crow.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:29:07.76" data-timestamp="1747.76"> How could you tell?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan Martin</h4><p begin="00:29:08.95" data-timestamp="1748.95"> It-- it was smaller. It was a bit smaller, and it wasn't as bulky.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:29:14.30" data-timestamp="1754.3"> OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan Martin</h4><p begin="00:29:14.75" data-timestamp="1754.75"> This crow, when I came outside, it caught at me, as if it almost recognized me, as if, oh, that's the guy. It cawed, and then it left. It flew down the block. And there's a green space at the end of the street. And about a minute later, it came back with the enforcer crow.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:29:33.75" data-timestamp="1773.75"> This smaller crow, snitching on Alan to the bigger crow-- this is a real thing. I ran Alan's story by a crow researcher named Loma Pendergraft. Loma said that if a crow sees something it deems dangerous, it will sound an alarm to summon other crows. And if they agree there's a threat, they'll dive-bomb. This whole routine is called "mobbing."</p><p begin="00:29:58.82" data-timestamp="1798.82">Some people, attacked by a murder of crows-- they'd be angry. Not Alan or his family.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan Martin</h4><p begin="00:30:05.53" data-timestamp="1805.53"> We felt bad. Because we realized we'd hurt these crows.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:30:09.52" data-timestamp="1809.52"> Hmm. Well, that's a very nice reaction.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan Martin</h4><p begin="00:30:11.73" data-timestamp="1811.73"> [CHUCKLES] Yeah, that was initially. But as the harassment persisted over the coming days, it became a source of anxiety, just going outside. So the compassion for the crow, I would say, waned over time a little bit because of that. And my next questions were, how long is this going to go on for?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:30:37.35" data-timestamp="1837.35"> Science actually has an answer to this question. It turns out crows can hold grudges for a very long time. Back in 2006, John Marzluff, who is a professor in wildlife science at the University of Washington-- he set up an experiment to test this. He put on this ugly, orange, ogre mask and walked around an area where he knew crows lived. And then, he captured a bunch of the crows while the rest of the flock looked on. Then he released them. The point was to distress the crows, but not hurt them.</p><p begin="00:31:12.21" data-timestamp="1872.21">And then, for the next 17 years, every time he put on his ogre mask and walked around the place where he first captured the birds, the crows would swarm him. For years, each time he returned, more and more crows would join in. Because crows not only remember their enemies, but pass their grievances onto their crow children and grandchildren. Alan was not aware of all of that. So for weeks, he'd leave his house every day, hoping the birds had finally forgotten about him. No such luck. So he tried a new tactic.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan Martin</h4><p begin="00:31:49.77" data-timestamp="1909.77"> I put on a wig and a beard, and the crow was looking hard. It was kind of turning its head a bit, side to side. You can tell it was trying to figure out who this was. But it didn't recognize me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:32:03.30" data-timestamp="1923.3"> Just a PSA. There are other ways to ward off an angry crow, should you not have a wig on hand. You can hide yourself under an umbrella so the crows can't see you. Or you can wear sunglasses backwards.</p><p begin="00:32:16.49" data-timestamp="1936.49">Apparently, crows understand that sunglasses go on your eyes. And they know that if you can see them, you can potentially hurt them. So they won't attack the back of your sunglassed head, because they think you have an extra set of eyes back there. Anyway, Alan's disguise-- it was working perfectly for him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan Martin</h4><p begin="00:32:34.73" data-timestamp="1954.73"> And then, I ripped off the beard and the wig, and the crow flipped. It flipped out.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:32:43.82" data-timestamp="1963.82"> Really?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan Martin</h4><p begin="00:32:44.10" data-timestamp="1964.1"> It did a backflip.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:32:45.62" data-timestamp="1965.62"> What? Oh, it literally flipped out?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan Martin</h4><p begin="00:32:47.78" data-timestamp="1967.78"> It just literally-- it kind of flipped back, up into the air a little bit. But it was completely in shock and extremely pissed off. Like, how dare you?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:32:58.18" data-timestamp="1978.18"> It sounds like you're developing a whole kind of relationship with these birds, almost.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan Martin</h4><p begin="00:33:03.91" data-timestamp="1983.91"> Yeah. It's a relationship of antagonism, and it's not a rewarding one.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:33:18.31" data-timestamp="1998.31"> Alan decided he had to make amends with the crows. A real truce. But how do you do that? How do you make things right with a couple of birds?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan Martin</h4><p begin="00:33:28.66" data-timestamp="2008.66"> If you could have just sat down with them and I could have apologized, and maybe they could have explained why those trees were so important, and I could have shown some understanding for them. And maybe we could have worked things out that way. But because we're unable to do that, I just thought food is maybe the next best thing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:33:48.99" data-timestamp="2028.99"> Food, you know, the tool of every animal trainer that's ever lived.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan Martin</h4><p begin="00:33:53.65" data-timestamp="2033.65"> And so I found this kind of brass, gold-colored plate. It was shiny. And so I put some almonds on it, and I walked outside with it above my head, kind of, holding my arms straight above my head. And I laid it out on the lawn.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:34:09.12" data-timestamp="2049.12"> The crows caw at him loudly while he puts the plate down. He goes back inside. And a couple hours later, Alan sees the plate sitting there, empty. The almonds are gone.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alan Martin</h4><p begin="00:34:21.04" data-timestamp="2061.04"> I did that for another three days. And then, it was on the fourth day. I came outside with the plate, but they weren't cawing this time. They seemed more subdued, less aggressive. And I put the plate out, I went back inside, and that was the last time I saw them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:34:47.75" data-timestamp="2087.75"> The crow researcher told me that it seemed like, since Alan had merely stressed the crows out and not actually hurt them, it might have been easier for them to forget why they were mad at him in the first place. Alan said the whole thing, having a couple of birds angry at him-- it kind of hurt his feelings.</p><p begin="00:35:06.56" data-timestamp="2106.56">It's not like he's naive. He knows nature doesn't care about his feelings. It's just that he loves nature so much, and his intentions were good. He can't help but feel like it would have been nice if the crows had shown a little tenderness towards him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:35:31.27" data-timestamp="2131.27"> Aviva DeKornfeld is a producer of our program.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act Three: You’ll Spank Me Later For This</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:35:38.65" data-timestamp="2138.65"> Act Three, You'll Spank Me Later For This. So in the show today about tenderness, we turn now to comedian Josh Johnson, who's been thinking a lot lately about when tenderness is called for, and when the opposite of tenderness may actually be the right way to go.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh Johnson</h4><p begin="00:35:54.46" data-timestamp="2154.46"> OK. This is like-- this is, like, a contentious thing. So just stick with me for a second. Because it's weird-- it's weird that people are weird about it. OK. So my friends are having kids, right? A lot of them are starting to have kids, so they're all having the conversation about if they're going to spank their kids, right?</p><p begin="00:36:18.80" data-timestamp="2178.8">And people have very strong feelings either way. Some people think, like, oh, if it's rare and it's warranted, then a spanking here and there is not that bad. And then, some people are like, no, this is, like-- this is full-on abuse. This is, like, you're creating trauma and everything. And I'm not even telling anybody how to feel. Like, I know that I was spanked when I was a kid. And it made sense that I was spanked, because we were poor.</p><p begin="00:36:47.33" data-timestamp="2207.33">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:36:50.14" data-timestamp="2210.14"></p><p begin="00:36:53.89" data-timestamp="2213.89">Do you understand what I mean? There was nothing to take away.</p><p begin="00:36:57.50" data-timestamp="2217.5">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:36:59.84" data-timestamp="2219.84"></p><p begin="00:37:01.24" data-timestamp="2221.24">You know? Like, there was a year that my mom and I shared a bedroom when I was a little kid. What was she going to take away? The floor?</p><p begin="00:37:09.82" data-timestamp="2229.82">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:37:11.47" data-timestamp="2231.47">Like, rest of the month, you float from now on. And if I catch you not floating, that's your ass, all right? Do you see what I mean? Because I was in a-- I was in a very weird position at one point. Because I didn't have much money, but I got a scholarship.</p><p begin="00:37:35.38" data-timestamp="2255.38">And my family pooled their money together to make the ends meet for me to go to this Catholic school, right? So I was a kid with no money, going to school with kids with real money. Like, money where they don't need to read.</p><p begin="00:37:54.55" data-timestamp="2274.55">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:37:57.21" data-timestamp="2277.21">You know what I'm talking about? You know that proper money that you can't mess up? You know that old money? And so I remember, there was one time we were-- we were sitting around the lunch table. And, uh-- and this one kid-- yeah, I said something about my mom spanking me for something, and we were still in junior high or whatever. So I was talking about a time from before, you know. And then, this other kid was like, oh, don't worry about it. My dad still spanks me, right? And I was like, ooh. Um.</p><p begin="00:38:34.81" data-timestamp="2314.81">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:38:38.12" data-timestamp="2318.12"></p><p begin="00:38:40.01" data-timestamp="2320.01">Tyler, you have a pool.

I'm not, like, blanketing, cosigning anything. I'm asking questions, genuinely. I'm asking questions, because people are very split on it. You know what I mean? But once again, we've all met a dude who, like-- damn.</p><p begin="00:39:38.66" data-timestamp="2378.66">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:39:41.68" data-timestamp="2381.68">He really probably had it coming sooner than today.</p><p begin="00:39:44.93" data-timestamp="2384.93">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:39:48.16" data-timestamp="2388.16"></p><p begin="00:39:50.47" data-timestamp="2390.47">But then, how do you-- how do you gauge that, you know? Because I get what some people are saying. Some people are like, look, we're all individuals. So even though you have your kids and your kids have a part of you in them, they're still going to be different people. So then, how do you make sure that this kid doesn't walk away with the worst lesson possible, the worst feeling possible from this thing that worked out for you, but it might not work out for them? That's a scary thing. You know?</p><p begin="00:40:17.82" data-timestamp="2417.82">Like-- OK. I used to-- I used to be, like, very nervous about moving to New York, right? I moved to New York years ago. And I remember when I got to Brooklyn, I saw a fight when I got there. And it was a-- these were two, kind of, big guys. One guy was, like, medium-sized, bigger than me, and he was muscular. And he looked like he knew how to fight, because he did all the stances.</p><p begin="00:40:51.63" data-timestamp="2451.63">He knew where to put his shoulders, put his fists. He could kick. He's either trained MMA in boxing, or he's watched all the movies. Like, this guy-- this guy really knows how to move, right? And then, the big guy was just a big guy. Like, he was-- he was that-- you know that type of big where you can't tell if it's fat or muscle? You just know it's in the way. Right? You know he can move things where he wants them to go. Just a big guy. Right? And I don't know-- I don't know exactly what they were fighting about, but it felt like one of those fights. It felt like one of those fights where they really wanted to fight their dad.</p><p begin="00:41:33.72" data-timestamp="2493.72">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:41:36.08" data-timestamp="2496.08">Have you ever been-- OK, have you ever been in a bar, and then you see a fight brew-- you can smell it brewing. And then you're also like, I think if you had, like, punched your dad years ago, none of this would be happening right now. Like, if you had just had one good row with him, this would be a quiet evening, right?</p><p begin="00:41:55.55" data-timestamp="2515.55">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:41:57.41" data-timestamp="2517.41"></p><p begin="00:42:00.68" data-timestamp="2520.68">And, uh, they were going at each other. And some of it was punching. Some of it was kicking. Now, the guy that was, like, on the bigger side and muscular-- he really knew his way around. Like, he was even doing the hop of someone who knows how to fight. You know that little light-foot hop where you're like, they're about to get into it. OK. And then, there was one moment-- because I walked out of this bar, because I was doing a show, like a bar show with my friends, and then we were all walking out. And we all saw this, like, happening.</p><p begin="00:42:29.21" data-timestamp="2549.21">It would start on the sidewalk, and it spilled into the street. And basically, he's doing the hops, and he goes for a lunge. He goes for, like, this big punch, right? And when he goes for the big punch, the big dude moves out of the way and grabs his wrist. And they both look at it. They both look at it like-- he grabs his wrist and looks at it. And then he looks at it like, uh-oh. And--</p><p begin="00:42:52.83" data-timestamp="2572.83">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:42:55.39" data-timestamp="2575.39">And then-- and then, he grabs his wrist, and with his other hand, he grabs the back of the dude's belt. Right? Pulls him forward, knocks the guy, pretty much, off balance, lets go of the wrist, passes the belt to his other hand, lifts him up, and then-- spanked him in public. And like--</p><p begin="00:43:18.74" data-timestamp="2598.74">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:43:21.19" data-timestamp="2601.19"></p><p begin="00:43:29.02" data-timestamp="2609.02">I had never seen somebody with a beard get spanked before. Like--</p><p begin="00:43:32.61" data-timestamp="2612.61">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:43:34.44" data-timestamp="2614.44">And he's really, like, floating and everything. And this guy is like, letting him have it, right? Like, one after the other. This dude spanked him so much, he took a break. There was one point where he was holding him suspended in the air by his belt, but also like-- whew.</p><p begin="00:43:49.91" data-timestamp="2629.91">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:43:52.78" data-timestamp="2632.78"></p><p begin="00:43:56.62" data-timestamp="2636.62">And then, after, like, the 36th lick, lets go to the belt. Dude drops to the ground. He gets up, and he sort of limps off. A lot of expletives and stuff, but it's kind of done. And this guy goes back into the bar we were just in. Because he wasn't watching the show. The show was in, like, a back room. This guy was just in the bar. And I had no idea, like, what the fight was about. Because, once again, we had already walked out, and it was already happening. But he walked back in, and I'm like-- I'm a curious duck. You know what I mean? Like--</p><p begin="00:44:31.18" data-timestamp="2671.18">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:44:33.30" data-timestamp="2673.3">So I go back in after him, and I'm like, hey, man, are you OK? Which is a weird thing to ask him. But-- it's like, are you OK? What was all that about? And then, he turns to me and goes-- I look like a lot of dudes' dads.</p><p begin="00:44:52.96" data-timestamp="2692.96">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:44:55.84" data-timestamp="2695.84"></p><p begin="00:45:04.50" data-timestamp="2704.5">This dude was, like, 30.

  <h3>Act Four: The Feels on the Bus</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:46:43.75" data-timestamp="2803.75"> Act Four, The Feels on the Bus. There are, of course, so many people who believe that being tenderhearted is not a good way to live in this tough and unforgiving world. For some people, it's a matter of principle. They think it works out better for everybody that way. Etgar Keret has this short story about someone like that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Etgar Keret</h4><p begin="00:47:02.35" data-timestamp="2822.35"> This is a story about a bus driver who would never open the door of the bus for people who were late. Not for anyone. Not for repressed high school kids who'd run alongside the bus and stare at it longingly, and not for high-strung people in windbreakers who'd bang on the door as if they were actually on time, and it was the driver who was out of line.</p><p begin="00:47:24.01" data-timestamp="2844.01">And not even for little old ladies with brown paper bags full of groceries, who struggled to flag him down with trembling hands. And it wasn't because he was mean that he didn't open the door. Because this driver didn't have a mean bone in his body. It was a matter of ideology.</p><p begin="00:47:42.00" data-timestamp="2862">The driver's ideology said that even if the delay caused by opening the door for someone who came late, was just under 30 seconds, and even if not opening the door meant that this person would wind up losing 15 minutes of his life, it would still be more fair to society to not open the door. Because the seconds would be lost by every single passenger on the bus. And if there were, say, 60 people on the bus who hadn't done anything wrong and had all arrived to the bus stop on time, then together, they'd be losing half an hour, which is double 15 minutes.</p><p begin="00:48:27.59" data-timestamp="2907.59">This was the only reason why he never opened the door. He knew that the passengers hadn't the slightest idea what his reason was, and that the people running after the bus and signaling him to stop had no idea either. He also knew that most of them thought he was just an ass [BLEEP], and that personally, it would have been much, much easier for him to let them on and receive their smiles and thanks. Except that when it came to choosing between smiles and thanks on the one hand and the good of society on the other, this driver knew what it had to be.</p><p begin="00:49:05.95" data-timestamp="2945.95">The person who should have suffered the most from the driver's ideology was named Eddie. But unlike the other people in this story, he wouldn't even try to run for the bus. That's how lazy and out of it he was.</p><p begin="00:49:18.76" data-timestamp="2958.76">Now, Eddie was assistant cook at a restaurant called The Steakout, which was the best pun that the stupid owner of this place could come up with. The food there was nothing to write home about.</p><p begin="00:49:30.71" data-timestamp="2970.71">But Eddie himself was a really nice guy. So nice, that sometimes when something he made didn't come out too great, he'd serve it to the table himself and apologize. It was during one of these apologies that he met happiness, or at least a shot at happiness, in the form of a girl that was so sweet that she tried to finish the entire portion of roast beef he brought her, just so he wouldn't feel bad.</p><p begin="00:49:56.29" data-timestamp="2996.29">And this girl didn't want to tell him her name or give him her phone number. But she was sweet enough to agree to meet him the next day at 5:00 at a spot they decided on together. The Dolphinarium, to be exact.</p><p begin="00:50:18.10" data-timestamp="3018.1">Now, Eddie had this condition, one that had already caused him to miss out on all sorts of things in life. It wasn't one of those conditions where your adenoids get all swollen or anything like that. But still, it had already caused him a lot of damage.</p><p begin="00:50:34.33" data-timestamp="3034.33">This sickness always made him oversleep by 10 minutes, and no alarm clock did any good. That was why he was always late for work at The Steakout. That, and our bus driver, the one who always chose the good of society over smiles and thanks.</p><p begin="00:50:53.95" data-timestamp="3053.95">Except that this time, since happiness was at stake, Eddie decided to beat the condition. And instead of taking an afternoon nap, he stayed awake and watched television. Just to be on the safe side, he even lined up, not one, but three alarm clocks, and ordered the wakeup call to boot. But this sickness was incurable, and Eddie fell asleep like a baby, watching the kiddy channel.</p><p begin="00:51:27.54" data-timestamp="3087.54">He woke up in a sweat to the screeching of a trillion, million alarm clocks. 10 minutes too late. Rushed out of the house without stopping to change and ran toward the bus stop. He barely remembered how to run anymore, and his feet fumbled a bit every time they left the sidewalk.</p><p begin="00:51:45.24" data-timestamp="3105.24">The last time he ran was before he discovered he could cut gym class, which was about in the sixth grade. Except that unlike in those gym classes, this time, he ran like crazy. Because now, he had something to lose.</p><p begin="00:51:58.26" data-timestamp="3118.26">And all the pain in his chest and his Lucky Strike wheezing weren't going to get in the way of his pursuit of happiness. Nothing was going to get in his way. Except our bus driver, who had just closed the door and was beginning to pull away.</p><p begin="00:52:15.92" data-timestamp="3135.92">The driver saw Eddie in the rearview mirror. But as we've already explained, he had an ideology that, more than anything, relied on love of justice and on simple arithmetic. Except that Eddie didn't care about the driver's arithmetic. For the first time in his life, he really wanted to get somewhere on time. And that's why he went right on chasing the bus, even though he didn't have a chance.</p><p begin="00:52:47.60" data-timestamp="3167.6">But then, Eddie's luck turned. But only halfway. 100 yards past the bus stop, there was a traffic light. And just a second before the bus reached it, the traffic light turned red.</p><p begin="00:53:01.03" data-timestamp="3181.03">Eddie managed to catch up with the bus and to drag himself all the way to the driver's door. He didn't even bang on the glass, he was so weak. He just looked at the driver with moist eyes and fell to his knees, panting and wheezing.</p><p begin="00:53:16.06" data-timestamp="3196.06">And this reminded the driver of something. Something from out of the past, from a time before he wanted to become a bus driver, when he still wanted to become God. It was kind of a sad memory, because the driver didn't become God at the end. But it was a happy one, too, because he became a bus driver, which was his second choice.</p><p begin="00:53:38.86" data-timestamp="3218.86">And suddenly, the driver remembered how he at once promised himself that if he became God in the end, he'd be merciful and kind and would listen to all his creatures. So when he saw Eddie from way up in his driver's seat, kneeling on the asphalt, he simply couldn't go through with it. And in spite of all his ideology and his simple arithmetic, he opened the door, and Eddie got on and didn't even say "thank you," he was so out of breath.</p><p begin="00:54:18.36" data-timestamp="3258.36">OK. Maybe the best thing would be to stop listening right now. Because even though Eddie did get to the Dolphinarium on time, happiness didn't come. Because happiness already had a boyfriend.</p><p begin="00:54:30.72" data-timestamp="3270.72">It's just that she was so sweet that she couldn't bring herself to tell Eddie, so she preferred to stand him up. Eddie waited for her on the bench they'd agreed on for almost two hours. While he sat there, he kept thinking all sorts of depressing thoughts about his life.</p><p begin="00:54:46.32" data-timestamp="3286.32">And while he was at it, he watched the sunset, which was a pretty good one, and thought about how cramped his legs were going to be later on. When he was really desperate to get home, he saw his bus in the distance, pulling in at the bus stop and letting go of passengers. And he knew that even if he'd had the strength to run, he'd never catch up with it anyway.</p><p begin="00:55:09.23" data-timestamp="3309.23">So he just kept on walking slowly, feeling about a million tired muscles with every step. And when he finally reached the bus stop, he saw that the bus was still there, waiting for him. And even though the passengers were shouting and grumbling to get a move on, the driver waited for Eddie, and he didn't touch the accelerator till Eddie was seated. And when they started moving, he looked in the rearview mirror and gave Eddie a sad wink, which somehow made the whole thing almost bearable.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:53.39" data-timestamp="3353.39"> Etgar Keret, reading the title story from his collection, <i>The</i> <i>Bus</i> <i>Driver</i> <i>Who</i> <i>Wanted</i> <i>to</i> <i>be</i> <i>God,</i> <i>and</i> <i>Other</i> <i>Stories.</i> If you want to get a short story in your email from Etgar once a week, you can sign up for that at his Substack, at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4025342721322b2532253400333522333421232b6e232f2d6d6d">[email&#160;protected]</a> that's Keret, K-E-R-E-T.</p><p begin="00:56:23.63" data-timestamp="3383.63"></p></div>  </div>
