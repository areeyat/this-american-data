  <h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:01.01" data-timestamp="1.01"> There's a scene in the film <i>I</i> <i>Am</i> <i>Legend</i> where, OK, civilization is over. The only person left alive in New York is Will Smith, and he is not able to find traces of anyone else alive anywhere on Earth. And every morning, he wakes up and makes himself breakfast, and puts on videos of <i>The</i> <i>Today</i> <i>Show</i> from back before the Earth was destroyed just to make the morning seem normal.</p><p begin="00:00:24.16" data-timestamp="24.16">One of the sports fans on our staff, Matt, was saying the other day that that is exactly what it's like today, watching the constant replays of old sports on television. He's watched the 2018 Stanley Cup, the NBA Finals Game 7 from 2013, an old Yankees game from 1978, the Masters last year that Tiger Woods won, all that glory from back when life was normal and sports was part of it. Part of the thrill of the Michael Jordan documentary <i>The</i> <i>Last</i> <i>Dance</i> was it wasn't just sports, but a primetime Sunday night sports event that you could look forward to and you could watch, knowing other fans were watching and talk about, and share memes just like the world used to be.</p><p begin="00:01:00.07" data-timestamp="60.07">These two guys who write about college football, Jason Kirk and Spencer Hall, wrote this thing that I love about the lack of sports in our world today. These are guys who normally spend over 50 hours a week on a slow week watching games and thinking about sports, who these days, like hungry men raiding an empty kitchen pantry for any scrap of food, have resorted to watching old college games that they've seen before and live Korean baseball in the middle of the night, and the German soccer league, Bundesliga.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Kirk</h4><p begin="00:01:26.44" data-timestamp="86.44"> Saturday morning, the choice was between Bundesliga and cornhole, the American tailgate game where people throw sandbags at a wooden plank.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:38.59" data-timestamp="98.59"> That's Jason. Here's Spencer, explaining what he's come to.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Spencer Hall</h4><p begin="00:01:42.31" data-timestamp="102.31"> I, yesterday, put on for the edification of my kids and their larger education, Ricky Steamboat versus Macho Man Randy Savage at WrestleMania 3. And it's largely considered the greatest wrestling match of all time. And I realized that since I'm homeschooling my kids, they had to see the important classics of my culture.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:02.43" data-timestamp="122.43"> The canon.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Spencer Hall</h4><p begin="00:02:03.36" data-timestamp="123.36"> The canon, yeah. No, I mean, it really-- we're joking, but we're not. Like canonically, there's a lot of controversy about what is in the canon, wrestling-wise. No one disputes this.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:14.47" data-timestamp="134.47"> Spencer's watching way fewer games under lockdown, and sometimes he says he thought this actually might be better for him, in some way, to devote fewer hours to sports, maybe.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Spencer Hall</h4><p begin="00:02:24.28" data-timestamp="144.28"> Maybe. But it also makes me realize that the things I fill them with aren't much better. There's a lot of empty--</p><p begin="00:02:29.70" data-timestamp="149.7">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:02:31.05" data-timestamp="151.05">There's a lot of empty space out there, man. There's a lot of empty space in life. And when somebody says, well, now you can fill it with something really meaningful, will you? Or is that even an option?</p><p begin="00:02:44.92" data-timestamp="164.92">I think there's only so much meaning you can pack into the hours of a week. I think there's only so much productivity within one person. I think that's something, by the way, this has forced me to confront.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:57.76" data-timestamp="177.76"> Anyway, the essay these guys wrote about sports during these sportsless months is called "What Were Sports?" And the tone of it is like people who live in tents surrounded by rubble after a war, remembering what it was like to live in houses, looking back on their old lives, which only now they appreciate for what they were. The essay starts this way.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Spencer Hall</h4><p begin="00:03:17.38" data-timestamp="197.38"> I remember there were expensive commercials. I definitely remember expensive commercials being a part of live sports. I only noticed this when sports on replay happened. The ads for replay games are cheap and very sad-- home generators, car warranties, bootleg tactical gear for things that shouldn't be tactical, like car visors and hearing aids.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Kirk</h4><p begin="00:03:37.78" data-timestamp="217.78"> Do you remember how, back when there were sports, each person had a list of teams they strongly preferred to win? Like if the Portland Trail Blazers and Memphis Grizzlies squared off, you and I would be a little bit happier about life if the Grizzlies were the team that won. What was that all about?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:56.37" data-timestamp="236.37"> Other things they miss-- Phillies fans doing things that were not normal for anybody but Phillies fans; spreadsheets of sports statistics for each game, whose results then went into a spreadsheet for the whole season, which then went into a historical archives spreadsheet. "Watching a four-hour game and walking away with one GIF-worthy moment," they write, "felt like a version of sifting for gold, but a version in which the dirt itself was valuable."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Kirk</h4><p begin="00:04:20.35" data-timestamp="260.35"> One cool thing I remember about sports is watching people run fast in one direction. It was fun to watch someone do this when unimpeded, such as when Usain Bolt walked into a mall in church shoes or whatever and ran as fast as the fastest NFL player ever had. But it was 10 times as fun when someone was able to run really far while other people were trying to stop that person from running far.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:41.80" data-timestamp="281.8"> Also fun, watching big people try to stop fast people from running. They write, "Sports were little chemistry labs designed to run for hours, months, and centuries, along the way producing countless things nobody could have predicted from the onset-- a cool, otherworldly space place where people could completely depressurize for several hours and sometimes succumb to space madness along the way when things went haywire."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Spencer Hall</h4><p begin="00:05:05.28" data-timestamp="305.28"> Do you remember that part? That part was like Apollo 13. Like when your team's starting safety went out with an injury and they had to figure out how to play with 10 defenders and one guy who should have been going to law school instead of covering the other team's best receiver. That part was a problem, but a fun one to solve.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Kirk</h4><p begin="00:05:21.16" data-timestamp="321.16"> These problems very much belong to someone else, despite us getting to invest feelings in whether they solved these problems or not. Caring about whether a mediocre general manager could finally figure out how to do sports budgets, this was kind of like politics, but in a fake world in which we didn't have to acknowledge politics can kill us. That was nice.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:46.45" data-timestamp="346.45"> There's a whole passage in the essay where Spencer reminisces about the last live game he went to, LSU and Clemson in New Orleans, and got oysters before the game, and met a friend at a restaurant the next day to eat and talk football for hours. He writes, "Do you hear all the beats of an impossible world playing there? I do. I feel every little ping of a world that I've only missed for 45 days at this point, like cactus needles just pressing into the skin of a hovering hand." Jason sums it all up neatly with this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Kirk</h4><p begin="00:06:14.79" data-timestamp="374.79"> For me, the thing that mattered most about sports is how they, by design, did not matter. We built industrial complexes around them, but at heart they were about discovering which side had earned the right to shout the cooler obscenities on any given day. And then the following day, we would rediscover.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:37.41" data-timestamp="397.41"> Well, today on our program, for everybody who is yearning for sports right now in our sportsless world, we try to help with radio methadone for your sports addiction. Is that metaphor too negative? We have sports stories from back before the lockdown, back when professional sports were still a vital daily living force. We relive the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.</p><p begin="00:06:58.74" data-timestamp="418.74">From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One: Friday Night Floodlights</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:12.97" data-timestamp="432.97"> Act One, Friday Night Floodlights. OK, so let's begin with this story of people yearning for sports to begin again in a moment a few years back, when nothing was normal at all. Businesses were shut down. School was canceled. Kids were stuck home. This story happened right after Hurricane Katrina, in two towns in Mississippi that sit right on the Gulf of Mexico, Waveland and Bay St. Louis.</p><p begin="00:07:34.67" data-timestamp="454.67">Waveland was pretty much wiped out in the hurricane. Most homes and businesses there were destroyed or severely damaged. Bay St. Louis only did a little better.</p><p begin="00:07:43.13" data-timestamp="463.13">A month after the hurricane, when we broadcast our story about them, most people still didn't have electricity. You couldn't drink water from the faucet. One of the first things they decided to bring back, even before that other stuff-- football, high school football. One of our producers back then, Lisa Pollak, went down there in 2005 during those early weeks after Katrina and put together this story.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:08:03.94" data-timestamp="483.94"> The Bay High Tigers played their first game of the season on the Friday before Katrina. They beat Hancock High, 30-14. After the storm, the joke was that they'd gone undefeated. Everyone figured the season was over. Players were homeless. The high school was closed.</p><p begin="00:08:18.91" data-timestamp="498.91">But just days after the hurricane, the Bay High coach, Brenan Compretta, started hearing from his players. They wanted to play football. They called his cell and sent text messages. They stopped him on the street. They wanted to play football. They wanted something that reminded them of what life was before.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brenan Compretta</h4><p begin="00:08:34.00" data-timestamp="514"> The thing that a lot of them were saying is it only takes 11 to play, and that no matter how many they had, they wanted to do this. That was the only thing that they had to look forward to.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:08:45.18" data-timestamp="525.18"> You wouldn't stage a school play without a school, but football's different-- here, anyway. In Bay St. Louis, game day starts at 6:30 AM with a team breakfast at a church. Newspaper stories about the game are posted on the wall at school. In the afternoon, drummers from the band march through the hallways just before the pep rally. Strangers in town stop players to talk about that week's game.</p><p begin="00:09:06.22" data-timestamp="546.22">So even though school won't start again until November, the coach called a meeting to try to restart the team. There were some challenges. Only 19 players showed up of the 70 who are on the team. They couldn't use their practice field since National Guardsmen were camping there. Their field house was destroyed and most of their equipment. And as for their uniforms--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brenan Compretta</h4><p begin="00:09:24.55" data-timestamp="564.55"> We pulled up a few days after the storm. They had people running around in our jerseys and cleats, and throwing balls around. And I guess it was fathers and sons or whatever.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:09:36.15" data-timestamp="576.15"> Wait, you saw people wearing your guys' football jerseys just as, like, replacement clothes?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brenan Compretta</h4><p begin="00:09:41.36" data-timestamp="581.36"> Right, exactly. And considering the circumstances, I didn't get really upset about it. I just was like, well, I guess if they need some clothes, they can go ahead and take them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tyler Brush</h4><p begin="00:09:57.13" data-timestamp="597.13"> They're saying that there's a possibility-- they're saying it's probably going to be one of the most packed games we've played ever.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:10:04.24" data-timestamp="604.24"> It's game day, the Tigers' very first game since Hurricane Katrina, one month after the storm. And I had flown to Mississippi, where Tyler Brush, the team's quarterback, is showing me around. There's not a lot to see, just huge piles of wreckage, and near the beach, mile after mile of empty spaces where houses and buildings used to be.</p><p begin="00:10:23.35" data-timestamp="623.35">After the hurricane, Tyler's family left for a while, moved to Florida, to a town where they used to live. They got a nice house, and Tyler began high school there. He was practicing with their football squad, and he was going to be a starter there too. But then Coach Compretta called. Tyler says coming back here was a hard choice.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tyler Brush</h4><p begin="00:10:40.36" data-timestamp="640.36"> My dad, he originally didn't want me to come back. I mean, he was pretty much against it, but he decided-- I mean, he said that it was my decision. I mean, I had to think about it a lot.</p><p begin="00:10:56.90" data-timestamp="656.9">I was nervous about coming back. I mean, I recognized the situation. I knew I was taking a chance if I came back here. College teams might not see me playing. But I felt that I still needed to come back, though, for whoever did come back.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:11:16.03" data-timestamp="676.03"> As quarterback, he didn't want to let the team down. So now his family's living 15 miles away in Diamond Head, and two of the team's other players whose families didn't return are living with them too. This is a strange place to be a kid right now.</p><p begin="00:11:28.75" data-timestamp="688.75">With no school, they spend their days doing cleanup work, hauling out sheet rock, and moving trees and debris. It's bleak and boring. Their favorite hangouts are gone. Football is one of the few things they have left.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tyler Brush</h4><p begin="00:11:41.43" data-timestamp="701.43"> We're actually pulling up to my house now. Yeah, this is-- pretty much nothing left of my house. There's stairs right here-- were right here, leading up to the house. They're completely gone.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:12:05.35" data-timestamp="725.35"> Literally all we are looking at are the wooden stilts that held up the house and the foundation, which looks like it was lifted up from the ground.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tyler Brush</h4><p begin="00:12:12.22" data-timestamp="732.22"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:12:12.79" data-timestamp="732.79"> And I mean, there isn't even stuff around, like furniture, or clothes. Where did all the stuff go?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tyler Brush</h4><p begin="00:12:18.88" data-timestamp="738.88"> I guess the water just washed them up that way-- wiped out. There's nothing left.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brenan Compretta</h4><p begin="00:12:29.41" data-timestamp="749.41"> Does anybody in here need pants? You need pants, come with me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:12:34.36" data-timestamp="754.36"> Over at the football field, the new uniforms arrive just in time, a gift from a man in North Carolina. And the kids line up while the coaches open the boxes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brenan Compretta</h4><p begin="00:12:41.05" data-timestamp="761.05"> 2, 3, 4, 5.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:12:42.42" data-timestamp="762.42"> The new jerseys are blue and white, not blue and gold, the school colors, but no one seems to care.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brenan Compretta</h4><p begin="00:12:46.95" data-timestamp="766.95"> Hold on. Hey, man. We're not getting picky here. Just relax, buddy. What do you need?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:12:51.40" data-timestamp="771.4"> This isn't the team it used to be. Over half the Tigers still haven't come back, so the coaches have filled out the roster with some new recruits-- a few seniors who've never played football, some freshmen from the school's ninth grade team, two guys from the Tigers' archrival, St. Stanislaus-- they canceled their season-- and to cap it all off <i>Bad</i> <i>News</i> <i>Bears</i> style, some scared looking seventh and eighth graders from the junior high. In all, it's still just 29 players, a long way from 70.</p><p begin="00:13:17.23" data-timestamp="797.23">Some of these kids are all but homeless, sleeping on other families' couches and floors. One linebacker is living in a camper alone, his parents hours away, all so he can play football. With everything these kids have been dealing with and everything they've seen, they seem genuinely relieved and excited to be here today, putting on jerseys and lacing up cleats.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Trevor Adam</h4><p begin="00:13:35.63" data-timestamp="815.63"> Everybody's just anxious to play again, to get things back to normal.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:13:39.10" data-timestamp="819.1"> That's Trevor Adam, a senior tight end. And for him, getting things back to normal means pretty much one thing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Trevor Adam</h4><p begin="00:13:45.67" data-timestamp="825.67"> I love hitting people. I mean, there is no better feeling in the world just unloading on somebody. I mean, even now, dealing with all this, you have an extra feel of warmth. You get just that exciting feeling about hitting somebody. There's no-- you can't explain it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:14:07.27" data-timestamp="847.27"> Equally excited is Brandt, a tenth grader. I think Brandt might be one of the happiest kids I've ever met. He doesn't stop beaming, even when he's talking about swimming through his flooded kitchen or living for weeks without plumbing or power. He moved to Texas to stay with a relative for a while, but didn't stay long.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandt</h4><p begin="00:14:23.17" data-timestamp="863.17"> Texas was great. Everybody was real kind, like scary kind. It was just like-- have you ever seen <i>The</i> <i>Stepford</i> <i>Wives,</i> how everything's perfect? That's how it was. They were all like, hi, how are you doing? Oh, can I get you anything-- clothes, food? And I'm like, I'm fine, ma'am.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:14:40.15" data-timestamp="880.15"> Does this feel like a normal couple hours before a game, or does it feel different?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Player</h4><p begin="00:14:44.75" data-timestamp="884.75"> Way different.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandt</h4><p begin="00:14:45.96" data-timestamp="885.96"> One thing I'm going to miss before the games, the pregame meals. And we don't have that here.</p><p begin="00:14:49.69" data-timestamp="889.69">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:14:50.53" data-timestamp="890.53">Them pregame meals were good, all you can eat.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:14:53.65" data-timestamp="893.65"> What kind of food?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandt</h4><p begin="00:14:54.40" data-timestamp="894.4"> Oh, baked chicken with all these spices on it. It was so good.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:14:57.79" data-timestamp="897.79"> You're making me hungry.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandt</h4><p begin="00:14:58.99" data-timestamp="898.99"> That was like a month ago.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:15:00.28" data-timestamp="900.28"> So you've stayed here this whole time. What's there been to eat for you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandt</h4><p begin="00:15:03.97" data-timestamp="903.97"> Oh, three meals a day, MREs.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:15:07.33" data-timestamp="907.33"> So what's an MRE taste like?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandt</h4><p begin="00:15:10.17" data-timestamp="910.17"> I'll tell you what. Meal number 20 and meal number 22-- 20 is spaghetti, and 22 is jambalaya-- the best. I told my mama she should step it up, because that stuff is-- I'm going to start getting MREs just regular.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brenan Compretta</h4><p begin="00:15:25.53" data-timestamp="925.53"> All right. Hey, guys. Everybody right here where these guys are. Get down. Y'all can take a knee or something. Let's go, real quick. You can sit down or take a knee, either one.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:15:33.16" data-timestamp="933.16"> It's late afternoon now, about an hour before the game. Everybody gathers around Coach Compretta, and he urges them to think about the past month when they get on the field tonight.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brenan Compretta</h4><p begin="00:15:41.68" data-timestamp="941.68"> Everything you have inside of you, let it out. All the aggravation, the frustration, having to get up and do all the junk you do every day because of this hurricane, let it all out right here. Play for your community, OK? That's why you're here, OK?</p><p begin="00:16:01.00" data-timestamp="961">Some people can't be here. Play for the guys who can't be here too. Play for Bay St. Louis and Waveland. Does anybody have any questions about anything-- offense, defense, special teams block? What?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cal</h4><p begin="00:16:15.28" data-timestamp="975.28"> I love everybody.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Player</h4><p begin="00:16:16.20" data-timestamp="976.2"> We love you too, Cal.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brenan Compretta</h4><p begin="00:16:17.52" data-timestamp="977.52"> Love you too, Cal.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:16:19.99" data-timestamp="979.99"> Of course, there's only so much love one football team can take.

Mary identified this as her 1978 girls varsity team trophy from Cardinal Dougherty High School.

I'm just as good as Maurice Cheeks, and the Doctor would like to play with me, Dr. J. And we could attribute our lack of success in the NBA to the fact that we were girls, soon to be women, who had never dunked.

Yeah, right, right. You can always hear a Cat Stevens song playing in the background.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:33:16.03" data-timestamp="1996.03"> As a kid, Mary played basketball mostly with her older brother, Daniel. The two of them roamed around the city together, looking for pickup games whenever they could, all summer, every weekend-- even at night, because the court down the street had lights. It was a way to get out of the house, to escape the chaos of 11 kids in a working class Irish family in a too-small house on the edge of Northeast Philadelphia. Basketball was a place of clear rules and gestures that always made sense. And home was a place where you could get hit for no reason or find yourself still hungry at the end of a meal. Mary remembered being hungry a lot growing up, a fact always cheerfully denied by the nuns at school.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Conway</h4><p begin="00:33:58.81" data-timestamp="2038.81"> The message was you couldn't be hungry, because your parents are saints. And they especially directed it to our family and to all the other families that had a lot of kids in them, that our parents were saints because they worked so hard to provide for us. So I thought that I was just extraordinarily greedy that I would want to eat when I was hungry.</p><p begin="00:34:25.33" data-timestamp="2065.33">I think that playing basketball was a way to say, like, if I could use my body in this way that got me status and attention and a certain amount of prestige, then my body was OK in a way, even though it was-- I mean, I was way too skinny when I was a kid. And it was cause for concern for the school nurse a couple times. And playing basketball was a way to say you're not going to have neural damage from being malnourished. You're just going to have these other minor malnourished problems.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:35:17.15" data-timestamp="2117.15"> Another good thing about basketball was that it was cheap. Mary bought the family a rim and a basketball for their backyard when she was only seven or eight, using her first communion money, $65 in $5 increments from everyone in her huge family. The only equipment she really needed and could never afford were good shoes. She always had those supermarket checkout line shoes with the hard plastic soles that were completely embarrassing, of course, but also had no gripability. So she would be running down the court and go sliding, and be called for traveling. So one year, she got up the courage to ask a girl down the block for her old shoes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Conway</h4><p begin="00:35:57.10" data-timestamp="2157.1"> Her name was Karen. And she had really nice Beta Bullets, high tops, white. And I wanted her sneakers because I knew she was getting new ones. And in our neighborhood, there is the practice of throwing your old sneakers up over the telephone wires when you're done with them. And most of them were hardly worn out at all. I mean, a lot of them you could see that there was tread missing, but it's not like you had ripped through the top of them.</p><p begin="00:36:27.64" data-timestamp="2187.64">And I'd asked her for them. And she said, yeah, that she would give them to me when she got her new ones. I thought that it was a little bit weird that I would ask somebody for their used shoes, but we had other clothes that were used from other people.</p><p begin="00:36:41.20" data-timestamp="2201.2">And she was tough, and she kind of had this like, you know-- she seemed like she'd be the kind of person that could keep something like that to her and would know what it meant. And she did. She never told anybody, except, of course, the most important person that she shouldn't have told, her mother. And her mother got really upset and told her that she couldn't give them to me. And there they were, hanging up on the telephone wire, my sneakers.</p><p begin="00:37:15.30" data-timestamp="2235.3">And I'm sure that her mom did that because she was afraid that if I came home with a pair of used sneakers that it would be insulting to my mother. I'm sure that they all had this understanding of themselves. Like, you don't insult someone else's-- you don't insult one of your peers by giving their kids your crappy shoes, even though they're better than the crappy shoes that you bought for them. [CHUCKLES]</p><p begin="00:37:37.66" data-timestamp="2257.66"></p><p begin="00:37:44.06" data-timestamp="2264.06">But there were always really beautiful sneakers hanging up on the wires. And there was no way to get them, no way at all. They just floated up there. And you know what? I think that's when I decided that platonic idealism was true.</p><p begin="00:37:58.49" data-timestamp="2278.49">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:38:00.74" data-timestamp="2280.74">There really was a perfect thing that I would never experience, at least while I played in that Catholic league.

It was like, there was no one that we knew who could dunk the ball, not a single woman that we knew. And we knew some tall women. We knew women who were in college.

This was a spectacular dunk because I didn't just get my hands up over the rim, I sailed over the rim with my feet and got above the basket, and just slammed the ball down through the thing. My whole body was above the rim.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:40:03.20" data-timestamp="2403.2"> Wow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Conway</h4><p begin="00:40:04.34" data-timestamp="2404.34"> It stayed in bounds the whole time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:40:11.29" data-timestamp="2411.29"> Mary Conway talking with our own Nancy Updike.

Let's turn to soccer. This is from Daniel Alarcon, the executive producer and host of <i>Radio</i> <i>Ambulante.</i> And it's about his dad.

And they were doing sort of, like, a night of arts and poetry or whatever-- a talent show essentially, yeah.

  <h3>Act Four: The Girl With the Golden Gloves</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:17.74" data-timestamp="2897.74"> Act Four, The Girl With the Golden Gloves. So now we travel back in time to a sweaty gym in 1998. That's when this was first broadcast. It's about somebody with a complicated relationship with the sport she loves from Meema Spadola.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:48:32.91" data-timestamp="2912.91"> Maritza was an accountant, a financial analyst at a huge insurance company. She was living day-to-day like anybody else. Then she heard about this boxing class that was being offered at the company gym. Some guy named Milton was teaching.</p><p begin="00:48:46.68" data-timestamp="2926.68">Maritza liked sports. She'd even taken an aerobic boxing class before. So she decided to go down and check it out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:48:53.22" data-timestamp="2933.22"> Here I am in a suit, coming in. It was the first time. I didn't have a chance to change. So I'm walking in all suited up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Milton</h4><p begin="00:49:00.15" data-timestamp="2940.15"> So Maritza comes up, and she's so short. She goes, I want to get rid of my stomach. I want to get rid of my gut.</p><p begin="00:49:07.59" data-timestamp="2947.59">She was so short. I look at her. And I go, honey, I teach boxing. This ain't boxing aerobics, aero boxing. If you want to come and dance around, jump around, I said, I'm not the guy for you. So this ain't what you want.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:49:20.32" data-timestamp="2960.32"> He wasn't even thinking about me. There's another girl who thinks this is aero-- I mean-- so I threw a punch. He goes, oh, you got a pretty good punch there. He goes, let me see what you got. Bam, bam.</p><p begin="00:49:33.21" data-timestamp="2973.21">You got a pretty good punch there, he goes. But who taught you how to box? Two steps. Then he's, like, trying to fix me.</p><p begin="00:49:38.46" data-timestamp="2978.46">I'm going to teach you how to weave. I'm going to shine you up like an old shoe and polish you up. He made me laugh. I thought it was amusing. I found it amusing.</p><p begin="00:49:49.83" data-timestamp="2989.83">It reminded me of watching the old movies. And this guy's telling me I'm like an old shoe. He's going to polish me. This guy's got an act.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Milton</h4><p begin="00:49:57.27" data-timestamp="2997.27"> So I started working with her every day, come down with the pads, giving her combinations. And she started falling into place. So I was like, whoa.</p><p begin="00:50:06.81" data-timestamp="3006.81">I said, you know something? I said, if I could bring you to my gym in Brooklyn, I said, you could win the New York City Golden Gloves. She goes, I can? I go, honey, what I got you doing right now, no girl fights the way you do right now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:50:20.73" data-timestamp="3020.73"> So that's how it all started.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:50:24.25" data-timestamp="3024.25"> Every day after work in Manhattan, Maritza would take the subway all the way out to Brooklyn to train for three or four hours at Milton's gym and then go all the way back home to Queens. She spent her weekends at the gym. No one in her old life understood what she was doing. She'd grown up in the projects, put herself through college, gotten an MBA, held a good paying job, and here she was, back so close to the streets.</p><p begin="00:50:46.36" data-timestamp="3046.36">When she got a broken nose and black eyes in the ring, she lied to her coworkers about it, didn't tell them she was boxing. Her parents didn't approve of women fighting. They were conservative, born in Puerto Rico. Her friends were suspicious of her weight loss. They accused her of being anorexic, infected with HIV, or addicted to drugs. But at the gym, everyone believed in her. Maritza was the only girl at Milton's, his first girl. So she'd spar with the men there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Milton</h4><p begin="00:51:12.98" data-timestamp="3072.98"> She took Joey one day, and she was throwing nonstop combinations and punches repetitiously. There was an old man sitting down in a chair, and he goes, god damn, that boy can throw some punches. She had the head gear on. So when she finished, he came over and he goes, that's going to be one good damn fighter. That boy is going to be great.</p><p begin="00:51:32.69" data-timestamp="3092.69">I go, I hate to tell you this. That's no guy. He goes, what do you mean that's no guy? Looked like a guy. I go, that's a girl. He goes, get out of here.</p><p begin="00:51:40.06" data-timestamp="3100.06">So I said, Maritza, come here. So she came over to me, and I took off her head gear. I go, does she look like a girl now? He goes, oh.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:51:56.27" data-timestamp="3116.27"> Looking at Maritza, you probably wouldn't think boxer. She's small, just over 5 feet tall, and only 106 pounds. Her features are fine and delicate. But when she talks about her love for boxing, you can see her in the ring. She's radiant. It's like speaking to someone who's had a religious conversion.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:52:13.55" data-timestamp="3133.55"> Boxing has shed a light on me. It's like my vision. It's like I just obtained a vision. It's like-- this is what I was put here for.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Announcer</h4><p begin="00:52:28.66" data-timestamp="3148.66"> Ladies and gentlemen, tonight's next bout is the women's 106 pound class. The referee is Pete Santiago. In the gold corner, Maritza Arroyo from the Supreme Team Boxing Club. Arroyo is a financial analyst and a part-time personal trainer.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:52:44.58" data-timestamp="3164.58"> With Milton's training, Maritza was unbeatable. Within a year, she had taken all the amateur titles in New York. She won the Metros, the Empire States, and in '96 she won the biggest of all, the Golden Gloves in Madison Square Garden, a fight televised around the world, held in a ring where some of the greatest boxers in history have fought.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Announcer</h4><p begin="00:53:03.10" data-timestamp="3183.1"> Two straight left hands by Arroyo. And another straight left. Four straight left hands by Arroyo.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:53:12.23" data-timestamp="3192.23"> Maritza and I get together to watch the video of her '96 Golden Gloves win. The garden's packed. The crowd's going wild. Maritza's incredibly fast and beautiful in the ring. Watching her, you understand what it means to be a smart fighter. She's calculated.</p><p begin="00:53:27.48" data-timestamp="3207.48">The woman she's fighting is taller than she is, with longer arms. So Maritza ducks down low and jabs up to the body, choosing where she lands her punches-- to the ribs, then to the chest. And when her opponent can barely catch her breath, Maritza's up, giving her a fierce combination to the face and head.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:53:43.80" data-timestamp="3223.8"> There goes the uppercuts. There goes another one to the body.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:53:47.13" data-timestamp="3227.13"> Ow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:53:48.21" data-timestamp="3228.21"> Another one to the body, another one, another one.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:53:51.33" data-timestamp="3231.33"> In the last 10 seconds, Manson gets in a good punch, straight to Maritza's face. Maritza stumbles back and then seems to go crazy. She throws nonstop combinations, and the crowd is screaming.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:54:02.89" data-timestamp="3242.89"> There, there goes the hook. See that? Whoa. That's it. 10 seconds. Bam. There you go. I threw it all.</p><p begin="00:54:08.57" data-timestamp="3248.57">Go, go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. Throw it. I missed a lot, but I threw.</p><p begin="00:54:16.36" data-timestamp="3256.36">[BELL RINGING]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:54:18.15" data-timestamp="3258.15"> Can we just watch the last 10 seconds? That was so cool. Oh my god. You are so good, Maritza. I want to see you fight so badly.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:54:29.10" data-timestamp="3269.1"> After the fight ends, we're laughing. We keep rewinding to watch Maritza's amazing finale.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:54:35.00" data-timestamp="3275"> I'm like, really? You got it good, right? Well, OK. All right, all right, all right, all right. OK, OK. Yeah, that was a grin. That was a good grin. That was a good grin.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:54:48.62" data-timestamp="3288.62"> We're both completely high and hysterical. Maritza's face is transformed. This is pure joy. And in a way it's terrible, because we both know she's quitting boxing.</p><p begin="00:54:59.66" data-timestamp="3299.66">Maritza wants to go pro, but there doesn't seem to be any way she could make a living at boxing. She's only 106 pounds. They don't even have a name for her weight class. If she went pro, no one knows of any women who are good enough to match her.</p><p begin="00:55:12.80" data-timestamp="3312.8">As it is, there are only two amateur women at her level. In all her title matches, she's always been put up against these same two opponents over and over. And she's beat them every time. In 10 years, there may be enough women that Maritza would be able to make a career of it, but she's already in her 30s. She says she has to be realistic about the future.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:55:32.99" data-timestamp="3332.99"> I get mixed feelings. When I go into the gym, I want to do it. But when I come away from the gym and I start looking at reality, it's like, I'm sad. It's like a sadness.</p><p begin="00:55:48.75" data-timestamp="3348.75">Nobody sees it on the outside. No one sees it. But on the inside, it's like it died. It's like, god, it could have been you. You should be in there, boxing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:55:58.34" data-timestamp="3358.34"> It's like she's in love with someone she knows she has to leave. So she circles around boxing, quits, comes back for one-night stands. Last year, Milton signed her up for the Metros tournament without telling her. On the night of the fight, he called her from ringside and told her they were holding up the match for her. Maritza got in her car and drove from Queens to Brooklyn while Milton lied to the judges about Maritza being stuck in traffic. She arrived, beat her opponent in three rounds flat, but was so disgusted with herself for fighting when she was trying to retire that she left without even collecting her trophy.</p><p begin="00:56:31.01" data-timestamp="3391.01">But being back in the game felt too good. And after that win, she just couldn't bring herself to walk away. Despite her reservations, she went on to fight in the 1997 New York Gloves and, of course, won.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Milton</h4><p begin="00:56:48.98" data-timestamp="3408.98"> Come right here real quick. There you go. See the difference? Go.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:56:52.84" data-timestamp="3412.84"> In February, just after Maritza misses the deadline for the 1998 Golden Gloves, I go to Milton's gym to see her fight. Even though, these days, Maritza isn't there much anymore, Milton has promised me that Maritza will spar with a new girl he's training. We wait and wait, and no Maritza. An hour passes.</p><p begin="00:57:10.51" data-timestamp="3430.51">When she finally shows, she looks worn out and tired. She's not dressed to box, and she says she's got the flu. She's not going to fight. Right away, everyone starts pushing her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:57:19.81" data-timestamp="3439.81"> Well, let's just do a little.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:57:20.74" data-timestamp="3440.74"> Do you want to?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:57:21.56" data-timestamp="3441.56"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:57:22.03" data-timestamp="3442.03"> But I got nothing with me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:57:23.34" data-timestamp="3443.34"> What do you need?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:57:24.37" data-timestamp="3444.37"> Everything. I don't have nothing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:57:27.73" data-timestamp="3447.73"> She says she didn't bring her shoes. She doesn't have any of her gear. Milton points to some shoes lying in the corner, says they're her size. Suddenly, Maritza doesn't look so tired.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:57:37.66" data-timestamp="3457.66"> But I got to tell you, I have no mouthpiece.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:57:40.24" data-timestamp="3460.24"> Then Maritza drops the pretense. We head down in the elevator to her car. Turns out, she's been carrying her gloves, her mouthpiece, her wraps, all of her equipment in her car for the past year, just in case.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:57:51.97" data-timestamp="3471.97"> I knew this was going to happen. That's why I don't want to come around here. That's why I don't want to come.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:57:55.27" data-timestamp="3475.27"> You've got the biggest smile on your face. You look so happy right now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:57:58.61" data-timestamp="3478.61"> Because I love boxing, that's why. It's got me where I'm at today, OK, very happy and very balanced, I guess. We're around Second Avenue, Second Avenue, between Second and Third, and 13th Street. So here I am, with no voice, going in this room to go spar. Is that crazy? That's crazy?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:58:22.72" data-timestamp="3502.72"> She grabs her bag, and we race back to the gym. And as Maritza's getting dressed, I notice she wears tiny golden gloves on a chain around her neck. Milton stands ringside, pumped up, ready to see his favorite in action again.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Howard Kelso</h4><p begin="00:58:35.50" data-timestamp="3515.5"> This is Howard Kelso live, right here from Supreme Team Boxing.</p><p begin="00:58:40.86" data-timestamp="3520.86">[BEEPING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:58:42.82" data-timestamp="3522.82"> Box.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Milton</h4><p begin="00:58:48.76" data-timestamp="3528.76"> Relax your shoulders, Maritza. Relax your shoulders. Too tight. Ooh, good one.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:58:54.74" data-timestamp="3534.74"> Maritza's stiff at first, then she starts to relax. She's ducking down, dancing around the ring. And in the last 10 seconds of the fight, she has a surge of energy. She's punching hard, moving fast, throwing nonstop combinations.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Milton</h4><p begin="00:59:11.31" data-timestamp="3551.31"> Come on, girl.</p><p begin="00:59:15.71" data-timestamp="3555.71">[BEEPING]</p><p begin="00:59:16.66" data-timestamp="3556.66">Time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:59:19.03" data-timestamp="3559.03"> And afterwards, she's pumped up with adrenaline, sweating, laughing with Milton and the guys in the gym. She says she'll be back to spar and train every week. And even though she's missed the deadline for this year's Golden Gloves, she swears she'll take the gloves next year. Stay tuned for 1999, she says. Stay tuned.</p><p begin="00:59:45.00" data-timestamp="3585">But Maritza doesn't show at Milton's the next week or the week after. She breaks two appointments with me. She doesn't return my calls. And when I finally reach her, she's angry-- angry she fought again, scared she's getting sucked back in.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:59:59.02" data-timestamp="3599.02"> And how about the fact that you're still carrying around your gear?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="01:00:05.32" data-timestamp="3605.32"> Well, I guess I can't let go of boxing yet. Maybe it's my security blanket. It's like always knowing that it's always there, that I can always hit that bag. I get in front of the mirror at my house every day, just jab and come around, and do the moves.</p><p begin="01:00:29.27" data-timestamp="3629.27">It's my connection to boxing. I carry this with me. I sleep with it. I have gloves in my car. I love it. It's me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="01:00:47.60" data-timestamp="3647.6"> That story from Meema Spadola.
