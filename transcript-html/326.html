  <h3>Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:05.27" data-timestamp="5.27">Bob Harris has won two cars and a lot of money playing <i>Jeopardy</i> on television. But he insists he's not that smart. What he is, he says, is somebody who decided when he was going to be on Jeopardy to take measures.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Harris</h4><p begin="00:00:17.48" data-timestamp="17.48">I told my girlfriend at the time, hi. I'm rearranging the furniture now. And I need to make my house look like the <i>Jeopardy</i> studio. I set up low bookcases to be sort of like where the podiums were, about the same height. And I would stand there. I had a little homemade buzzer that I made out of a ballpoint pen and some masking tape.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:39.94" data-timestamp="39.94">He got bright halogen lights. And he pumped up the air conditioning to make it feel like the inside of a TV studio. He placed a big picture of <i>Jeopardy's</i> host, Alex Trebek, in about the spot where the real Alex Trebek stands.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Harris</h4><p begin="00:00:50.68" data-timestamp="50.68">I even tried to time my meals to when I would be eating at <i>Jeopardy,</i> so that my whole body clock would be exactly in harmony.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:08.16" data-timestamp="68.16">So he played along with videotapes of the TV show. And he studied for months, memorizing all kinds of stuff, the guys who ran the United Nations in order, the presidents in order, rivers, the elements, British kings, the novels of E. M. Forster-- which include, by the way, <i>Room</i> <i>With</i> a <i>View,</i> <i>Where</i> <i>Angels</i> <i>Fear</i> to <i>Tread,</i> <i>Howards</i> <i>End.</i></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Harris</h4><p begin="00:01:26.19" data-timestamp="86.19">The way to remember a lot of stuff is to build really big, goofy images. It takes an extra couple of seconds, maybe even a minute or two of thought, but then it stays better. So it's time well invested. I made this big picture in my head of a room with a view. OK, so you've got this nice, really big, like-- a friend of mine in Ohio grew up in this big mansion, so it's actually his living room in my head. So OK, it's a room with a beautiful view.</p><p begin="00:01:49.84" data-timestamp="109.84">And <i>Howards</i> <i>End</i> was the next one on the list that I just happened to have in front of me. And so <i>Howards</i> <i>End</i>, and you've got <i>A</i> <i>Room</i> <i>With</i> <i>a</i> <i>View</i>. I mean, how can you not have, like, Howard-- I have a friend named Howard. And so I made a 30-foot buttocks and stuck it in the window. So you have a room with a view of Howard's end where angels fear to tread. So the angels are in this room, and there's this giant 30-foot buttocks in the window.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:11.86" data-timestamp="131.86">That's why the angels fear to tread there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Harris</h4><p begin="00:02:13.79" data-timestamp="133.79">Who really wants to be there, really?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:16.25" data-timestamp="136.25">All I can say is, you do not want to know how he got <i>Passage</i> <i>to</i> <i>India</i> in there. Bob says that a third of the answers that he gave on television-- a third-- came from cramming information into his head with these weird pictures that he would create for himself. And one of his biggest wins came when-- thanks to brute memorization-- he knew the name of an old book called <i>The</i> <i>Compleat</i> <i>Angler,</i> which to this day he has never read, has only the vaguest idea what it's about. And one of his biggest losses came when he could not remember the poem, &quot;Jabberwocky.&quot;</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Harris</h4><p begin="00:02:43.84" data-timestamp="163.84">And I was particularly frustrated because this was my father's favorite poem. And he recited it to me pretty constantly. And yet, when they asked me about it under pressure, I just completely choked. And so Brillig became my nickname, for some people.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:56.87" data-timestamp="176.87">I wonder if the reason why you didn't remember it was because it wasn't part of your <i>Jeopardy</i> knowledge, but because it was part of your real knowledge.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Harris</h4><p begin="00:03:02.77" data-timestamp="182.77">I think that's exactly right. I think there are a lot of times in the game-- most of the big mistakes I ever made were like that, where it wasn't in my <i>Jeopardy</i> notebooks, my study materials, the almanacs.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:15.76" data-timestamp="195.76">It's funny. It's sort of like it was in the wrong section of your brain.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Harris</h4><p begin="00:03:18.37" data-timestamp="198.37">Yeah, exactly. It was in my real brain, the one I walk around with that doesn't have much in it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:22.98" data-timestamp="202.98">Talking to Bob about all this, you realize that a show like <i>Jeopardy,</i> a quiz show, any quiz show on the surface seems like it's about facts, retrieving facts to win prizes. But what's really going on for the players is totally different than just retrieving facts. There's a whole inner world happening, an inner world that is not on TV at all, an inner world that actually may be a lot more interesting than what's in the program that's on TV.</p><p begin="00:03:45.56" data-timestamp="225.56">Well today, we dive in to look at that inner world, at the secret life of quiz shows. From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>, distributed by Public Radio International. I'm Ira Glass. Our program today in three rounds. Round One, Gamester of Ireland is Fine. The round is about somebody who goes on to <i>Who</i> <i>Wants</i> <i>to</i> <i>Be</i> <i>a</i> <i>Millionaire</i>, and the most amazing thing he comes up with is not any fact, not any answer, it is the sheer courage to appear at all.</p><p begin="00:04:12.44" data-timestamp="252.44">Round Two, Dire Enigmas for Elite Fans, where we visit with some of the best quiz masters anywhere on an all-weekend, all-day, all-night quiz bender.</p><p begin="00:04:23.22" data-timestamp="263.22">Round Three, Girls in Need of a Safer Time. By the way, if you are noticing anything special about these round names, five points for you as you play along at home. Anyway, round three is an attempt to use quiz shows-- yes, quiz shows-- to change teenage girls. Stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One: Gamester Of Ireland Is Fine</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:47.73" data-timestamp="287.73">Act One, Gamester of Ireland is Fine. When Ronan Kelly went to talk to the guy in this next story, all he knew about him was that he had won a lot of money on a quiz show on RTE, which is the main television station in Ireland. And Ronan just figured that anybody who had won that kind of money must have some kind of story to tell. And anyway, the guy lived nearby. So Ronan got onto his bike with his recording gear, and he bicycled over to the guy's house.</p><p begin="00:05:11.90" data-timestamp="311.9">When he got there, he figured that the first thing they would do is watch the video of the guy on the quiz show. But although this man had won hundreds of thousands of pounds, he actually did not have the technology to do that. What you're about to hear is the story that Ronan put together for Irish radio about this guy. The guy is named Roger Dowds.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ronan Kelly</h4><p begin="00:05:29.30" data-timestamp="329.3">When I got to Roger's house to watch the tape of his appearance, he didn't have a VCR. We had to go back to the radio station to watch it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gay Byrne</h4><p begin="00:05:37.28" data-timestamp="337.28">Roger Dowds from Dublin.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ronan Kelly</h4><p begin="00:05:40.01" data-timestamp="340.01">January 2001.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ronan Kelly</h4><p begin="00:05:42.28" data-timestamp="342.28">Were you told to wave?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roger Dowds</h4><p begin="00:05:43.99" data-timestamp="343.99">Oh, yes. They made a big issue about waving and smiling and looking as happy as possible.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gay Byrne</h4><p begin="00:05:48.22" data-timestamp="348.22">[UNINTELLIGIBLE] from Dublin.</p><p begin="00:05:49.41" data-timestamp="349.41">[GAME SHOW MUSIC]</p><p begin="00:05:53.84" data-timestamp="353.84">And it's Fastest Finger first. Stand by your keypads, please.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ronan Kelly</h4><p begin="00:06:03.69" data-timestamp="363.69">He was a contestant on the quiz show, <i>Who</i> <i>Wants</i> <i>to</i> <i>Be</i> <i>a</i> <i>Millionaire</i>. I should have put the word &quot;unlikely&quot; in there. Roger was an unlikely contestant, and you'll find out why as the program unfolds.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gay Byrne</h4><p begin="00:06:16.87" data-timestamp="376.87">Silence in the studio, please. This is your question. Starting with the largest, arrange these Mediterranean islands in order of size, starting with the largest.</p><p begin="00:06:29.36" data-timestamp="389.36">[GAME SHOW MUSIC]</p><p begin="00:06:32.75" data-timestamp="392.75">Crete, Cyprus, Sicily, Malta.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roger Dowds</h4><p begin="00:06:35.84" data-timestamp="395.84">Well, there was a phone number you could ring on RTE, obviously. And I rang many times, anyway, with no luck. And eventually, I got a call from someone to say I'd been short-listed. It was a couple of days before the show. You know, they said, oh, you're allowed to have five Phone-a-Friends.</p><p begin="00:06:52.15" data-timestamp="412.15">I don't have many close friends, so I got two of my brothers. I got someone I play table tennis with. I got the husband of someone I play badminton with, a friend of my brother's, I think. They were the five.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gay Byrne</h4><p begin="00:07:04.02" data-timestamp="424.02">And who got there quickest? Two right answers. But Roger Dowds beat it at 4.9 seconds. 4.9 seconds. Well done, Roger. There you go.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roger Dowds</h4><p begin="00:07:14.13" data-timestamp="434.13">You know, I wasn't one of these so-called professional quiz people. I'm not an outgoing enough person to be like that, really. People were astounded that I would think of going on <i>Who</i> <i>Wants</i> <i>to</i> <i>Be</i> <i>a</i> <i>Millionaire</i>.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gay Byrne</h4><p begin="00:07:29.70" data-timestamp="449.7">Now ladies and gentlemen, our next contestant is Roger Dowds. He works as a maintenance assistant in a nursing home. And he lives in Glasnevin in Dublin. And he specifically wants me to mention that his mother, Nora, is deceased, but would be very proud, indeed, to see him on this show.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ronan Kelly</h4><p begin="00:07:44.68" data-timestamp="464.68">Why did you say that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roger Dowds</h4><p begin="00:07:45.75" data-timestamp="465.75">Well, I still was getting over my mother's death somewhat at the time. She was about three years' dead at the time. And she had been such a part of my life. She probably was quite concerned about my future when she died.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gay Byrne</h4><p begin="00:08:00.22" data-timestamp="480.22">And if he won GBP 1 million, he says, he'd help the residents of the nursing home where he works to buy a place and run it however they please. And then he would love to have enough money--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roger Dowds</h4><p begin="00:08:08.69" data-timestamp="488.69">You know, because you don't really believe you're going to be on, and you go through a lot of questions, what you might say in a circumstance, and I kind of said something very frivolous, expecting not to ever be saying anything.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gay Byrne</h4><p begin="00:08:22.62" data-timestamp="502.62">All right, good luck to you.

In the 1968 cartoon, what was the color of the Beatles' submarine? Was it blue, yellow, green, or red?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roger Dowds</h4><p begin="00:08:49.68" data-timestamp="529.68">Yellow. OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gay Byrne</h4><p begin="00:08:50.88" data-timestamp="530.88">For GBP 100, yellow is right. You've got GBP 100, Roger.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ronan Kelly</h4><p begin="00:08:56.82" data-timestamp="536.82">Financially, how were things at the time? Was that an interest for you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roger Dowds</h4><p begin="00:09:00.81" data-timestamp="540.81">Yes, it was a factor. I never had full-time employment ever in my life. I was at the time working in this home. But I was only working part-time. And I might have done the odd little odd job, but I was on an extremely low income. So I suppose the money aspect could be significant to me and my position.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Roger Dowds</h4><p begin="00:09:24.93" data-timestamp="564.93">It's not the other name.

I didn't practice at all. I remember going in the day, and there were all the other contestants. And some of them were poring over quiz books. I just was trying to cope with being there. They made a tremendous day out of it. You were kind of treated like royalty. We were chauffeur-driven in. I think we got a very special lunch that no one else in RTE was getting.</p><p begin="00:10:08.55" data-timestamp="608.55">And I remember thinking, oh, something different is happening today, because I saw some of the people that I recognize who were actors in <i>Fair</i> <i>City.</i> And, I don't know, one or two-- someone who's in Sport in RTE, in addition to all these people. And I don't know whether I'm starstruck or not.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gay Byrne</h4><p begin="00:10:25.89" data-timestamp="625.89">No doubt about that one. You have GBP 1,000.

Each week in our program we choose a theme, and bring you a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's show, The Secret Life of Quiz Shows. We've arrived at act two of our show. Act Two, Dire Enigmas For Elite Fans.</p><p begin="00:32:11.83" data-timestamp="1931.83">Every winter, there is this event at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where some of the country's very best puzzle solvers go up against the very best puzzle writers. It's called the MIT Mystery Hunt. And what it is is a series of puzzles-- word puzzles, number puzzles, scavenger hunts, picture puzzles, puzzles which don't even have a name.</p><p begin="00:32:30.69" data-timestamp="1950.69">And eventually what all this leads to-- this takes all weekend or longer-- what it leads to, the final answer, it leads you to a coin hidden somewhere on the MIT campus. This is a team competition. The teams are made up of MIT students, and also elite puzzle solvers who fly in from around the country for the event.</p><p begin="00:32:47.87" data-timestamp="1967.87">One of our producers, Lisa Pollak, joined them for last year's contest. She was following a team called Dr. Awkward. And for those of you who are playing along at home, Dr. Awkward is spelled, D-R period Awkward, A-W-K-W-A-R-D. Give yourself two points if you noticed that that is a palindrome, spelled the same forwards and backwards. Here's Lisa.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:33:08.12" data-timestamp="1988.12">When you hang out with a puzzle team, you hear a lot of stories like Dave Dickerson's. When Dave was just a kid, he got this book. He'll never forget the title.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Dickerson</h4><p begin="00:33:16.04" data-timestamp="1996.04"><i>Puzzles</i>, <i>Puzzles</i>, <i>Puzzles,</i> <i>Puzzles,</i> <i>Puzzles.</i></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:33:17.94" data-timestamp="1997.94">Actually, the title might have just been <i>Puzzles,</i> but that's what the cover said. Dave was obsessed with this book. The puzzles were harder than any he'd ever seen, but he couldn't put them down.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Dickerson</h4><p begin="00:33:27.55" data-timestamp="2007.55">And I even remember when I saw one of the clues-- not an elegant clue by modern standards-- but it said, damn, I'm trying to fix these socks. And the answer was darn. The darn socks. You know, needle and thread. And I thought, I get that. And I solved it. It was the first clue I had actually solved. And I thought, I can do this. I had never been challenged this much in my life. And I didn't realize I could do it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:33:55.78" data-timestamp="2035.78">Not only could Dave do it, he found it impossible to stop doing it, which is how, almost 30 years later, he ended up here, standing in an MIT classroom with the rest of the Dr. Awkward team, warming up for the mystery hunt. And by warming up, I mean they were plugging in their laptops and setting up a snack table.</p><p begin="00:34:12.52" data-timestamp="2052.52">This was an experienced team with about 45 people on the roster. And as far as brainpower goes, they were an intimidating crew-- crossword champs, PhDs, a guy handing out DVDs of his recent appearance on <i>Jeopardy,</i> two guys whose T-shirts I needed help deciphering, and this man, whose nickname I'm still trying to figure out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kevin Wald</h4><p begin="00:34:30.88" data-timestamp="2070.88">Ucaoimhu, spelled U-C-A-O-I-M-H-U. And it's from my real name, Kevin Wald. You split it up as KEV-IN W-ALD. Ald is an archaic form of the word &quot;old,&quot; so you take an old-style &quot;W&quot;, which is two &quot;U's.&quot; You take &quot;Kev&quot; the way it's in the original Irish spelling, which is C-A-O-I-M-H. And you put it in the two &quot;U's,&quot; so you get Ucaoimhu.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Dickerson</h4><p begin="00:34:55.10" data-timestamp="2095.1">We're definitely a dangerous team. There's no question about it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:34:58.74" data-timestamp="2098.74">That's Dave again. He's the person who invited me to hang out here. And he warned me that the puzzles I'd see his team solve that weekend wouldn't be what most of us imagine when we think of puzzles. Mystery hunt puzzles are so elaborate, so complex, that lots of times they don't even have instructions, just a page of words or pictures or numbers arranged in some cryptic way, which means you've often got to solve a puzzle just to know what puzzle you're trying to solve.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Dickerson</h4><p begin="00:35:22.56" data-timestamp="2122.56">So for example, the first puzzle hunt-- or maybe one of the first-- the guy who did it did a puzzle in Linear A, which is an old language. I think it's older than Greek, a very, very primitive, ancient language. And he didn't tell anyone it was Linear A. And he took the only two books on Linear A out of the MIT library. People solved it anyway.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:35:47.93" data-timestamp="2147.93">Hey, everybody!</p><p begin="00:35:49.42" data-timestamp="2149.42">[CHEERS]</p><p begin="00:35:51.91" data-timestamp="2151.91">How you doing today?</p><p begin="00:35:52.86" data-timestamp="2152.86">[CHEERS]</p><p begin="00:35:54.27" data-timestamp="2154.27">That's right.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:35:55.21" data-timestamp="2155.21">The mystery hunt started with an opening ceremony put on by last year's winning team. They're called The Evil Midnight Bombers What Bomb At Midnight. That's the way the hunt works. The group that won last year's hunt designs and runs this year's contest. Dozens of teams pack the lobby of an MIT building. And though they were competing, from what I could tell the mood seemed pretty friendly. The Evil Midnight Bombers kicked things off with a skit. Then all the teams headed off to various locations around campus, and the solving began.</p><p begin="00:36:22.28" data-timestamp="2182.28">[CHALK ON A CHALKBOARD]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeremy</h4><p begin="00:36:24.52" data-timestamp="2184.52">So what do you do with FNTLLLLLLSNN?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tripp</h4><p begin="00:36:29.05" data-timestamp="2189.05">Those ?] just might be an index to something else. It might not even be an index to something in this round.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:36:33.47" data-timestamp="2193.47">That's Jeremy and [? Tripp, ?] two Dr. Awkward teammates, standing at a blackboard a few hours into the hunt. Now I'll be honest, as a spectator sport, competitive puzzle solving has some problems. Most of the time there wasn't much to see, just people huddled in small groups around laptops and conferring over printouts, batting around one idea after another until they hit on an answer.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 1</h4><p begin="00:36:52.66" data-timestamp="2212.66">The third one is <i>Gilligan's</i> <i>Island.</i> Who's writing this down?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:36:57.17" data-timestamp="2217.17">Things seemed to be going pretty well. The blackboard was filling up with answers and new puzzles kept coming. But there were some stumpers, too.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 2</h4><p begin="00:37:04.52" data-timestamp="2224.52">And that doesn't look promising. So look at last letters.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 3</h4><p begin="00:37:08.39" data-timestamp="2228.39">SAX?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:37:09.09" data-timestamp="2229.09">The name of this puzzle was Continental Divide. It was one of those no-instruction puzzles. There was a sheet of paper with a bunch of pictures of DVD movie covers on it. And the covers were arranged in a grid, six boxes across and five down. The bottom right-hand box was empty. All the titles on the covers were blacked out. Finding those was the easy part. It turns out all the films had a city, state, or country in the name. <i>Raising</i> <i>Arizona</i>, <i>Road</i> <i>to</i> <i>Singapore</i>, <i>The</i> <i>Tailor</i> <i>of</i> <i>Panama</i>. And so on.</p><p begin="00:37:36.14" data-timestamp="2256.14">The answer, everyone agreed, had something to do with those place names, but what? Were they trying to put a title in the missing box? Spell a sentence from a combination of letters? I watched for more than an hour as at least a dozen different people tried together to figure it out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 4</h4><p begin="00:37:51.13" data-timestamp="2271.13">Annapolis, Dallas, Essex, Cancun. All of these in this column do not end in vowels.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:37:57.78" data-timestamp="2277.78">They plotted the names on a map. They typed them into a spreadsheet. They put them in a grid and they color coded them by continent. No pattern was too absurd to consider.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Eric</h4><p begin="00:38:06.74" data-timestamp="2286.74">Arizona Iced Tea, Singapore sling, Panama hat.

But they didn't know that yet. For now, despite all the work, they weren't getting anywhere. At times I couldn't believe they were actually doing this for fun. But for puzzle people, the struggle is part of the fun. It's not in vain, because they know that somewhere out there there's an answer.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Eric</h4><p begin="00:38:43.44" data-timestamp="2323.44">I mean, somebody can say something in the next 15 seconds that will just break this whole thing wide open.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:38:49.42" data-timestamp="2329.42">That's Eric, a veteran of the team. And what he's talking about there, that flash of insight, that aha moment when something suddenly becomes clear, that's the payoff.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Eric</h4><p begin="00:38:59.87" data-timestamp="2339.87">An observation that nobody else saw, seeing through the problem. And that's difficult to do. And I'm not going to do it on every puzzle. I'm not one of the geniuses around here. But I am able to contribute something, and I'm just waiting for that to happen.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:39:11.55" data-timestamp="2351.55">You don't have to solve a puzzle to have an aha moment. The puzzles, if you're a puzzle person, are a pretty reliable way to get them, as opposed to real life, where, as a team member named John pointed out to me, most problems don't come with their own answers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John</h4><p begin="00:39:24.47" data-timestamp="2364.47">You know, it's very different trying to figure out, why does my daughter hate me? And how can I help her? Because there's no solution to that. Versus, OK, what are those numbers in the background of the evil video? Are they trying to say some message there? This you get the joy of, OK. At least you got the answer, and you know that you got the answer.</p><p begin="00:39:50.27" data-timestamp="2390.27">[INTERPOSING VOICES]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kevin Wald</h4><p begin="00:39:53.15" data-timestamp="2393.15">It is right now 1:23 in the morning. And we're in the sixth round. We've got tons and tons of puzzles in these rounds.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:40:02.50" data-timestamp="2402.5">When I caught up with Ucaoimhu, the Dr. Awkward team had been solving puzzles for 13 and 1/2 straight hours. The desks were covered with empty food containers. And the classroom was starting to smell like a dorm room whose residents hadn't showered in a while. Some team members had gone home to sleep. And a night crew with fresher brains had shown up to relieve them. But Ucaoimhu, like a lot of the 20 or so people here, had been there since the start.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:40:23.93" data-timestamp="2423.93">How are you feeling right now?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kevin Wald</h4><p begin="00:40:25.65" data-timestamp="2425.65">Right now, I'm feeling tired. And I'll probably leave within the next hour or so. Fortunately, what I'm working on now is a nice, gentle kind of puzzle.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:40:35.53" data-timestamp="2435.53">And by a nice, gentle kind of puzzle, what Ucaoimhu meant was a grid that looked kind of like a crossword puzzle, only with no blacked-in squares, no numbers, and no clues. I repeat, no clues at all, just empty boxes. Oh, and in the background, a red cross, like on an English flag. And yes, they solved it.</p><p begin="00:40:57.09" data-timestamp="2457.09">I stuck around that night watching until 6:00 in the morning. And what struck me about the whole scene was how matter of fact everyone was, like there was nothing out of the ordinary here, as if this was the most normal thing in the world, men and women, some college students, but plenty with spouses and kids at home, staying up all night in a college classroom solving puzzles.</p><p begin="00:41:17.34" data-timestamp="2477.34">But the next day, as the hunt stretched into its 30th hour, I caught up with Dave, the guy who invited me here. And he told me that, as a puzzle person, he was constantly being reminded that the rest of the world doesn't work this way. Just the other day, he'd gone into a bar. And when the female bartender came over, he told her about this cool new anagram he'd heard, how if you take the phrase, a dream within a dream, and rearrange the letters, you get, what am I? A mind reader.</p><p begin="00:41:42.83" data-timestamp="2502.83">This didn't go over so well. The bartender-- apparently finding this fact neither interesting nor charming-- just looked at Dave like he was weird. Dave told me that years ago, while he was working as a greeting card writer for Hallmark in Kansas City, he actually got in trouble for doing this kind of thing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Dickerson</h4><p begin="00:41:58.75" data-timestamp="2518.75">My mentor came to me and said, Dave, we have to talk. And he said, Dave, you're using too many literary allusions in your casual speech and people are complaining.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:42:13.09" data-timestamp="2533.09">Wait, wait. In your speech, not in your greeting cards?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Dickerson</h4><p begin="00:42:16.42" data-timestamp="2536.42">Right, right, just in my everyday speech. I knew better than to use obscure allusions in greeting cards, goodness gracious. I asked my supervisor, what the hell does that even mean? And he said, I was just told to tell it to you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:42:31.47" data-timestamp="2551.47">Dave started obsessing about this. He wasn't even sure what the problem was, so he began keeping track. One week, every time he had the urge to say something at work, he wrote it in a notebook instead.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Dickerson</h4><p begin="00:42:42.50" data-timestamp="2562.5">By the end of that week, my notebook was full of the most random crap. None of it was a literary allusion.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:42:49.29" data-timestamp="2569.29">Maybe, Dave thought, the problem wasn't him. He'd recently been transferred from the humor department to the serious writing staff. And he was surrounded by all these new people who probably just didn't understand him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Dickerson</h4><p begin="00:43:00.07" data-timestamp="2580.07">I was still doing lunch with the guys from humor. That was what I felt was my real home, and I could be myself there. And so I was at lunch with them maybe two or three weeks later, and one of the guys, as we were going to lunch, said, you know-- and it was a cluster of us, five or six of us, all heading toward the lunch room. And one of the guys said, you know, we do a lot of monkey cards. And yet--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:43:25.93" data-timestamp="2605.93">You mean cards with pictures of monkeys?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Dickerson</h4><p begin="00:43:27.93" data-timestamp="2607.93">Yes, yes, more or less, because what he actually said was, and yet, they're all illustrated with chimpanzees. And chimpanzees aren't monkeys, are they? And I said-- because I had done a report on this in fourth grade, and because it was something of an obsession of mine, monkeys, apes, and so on-- was I said, actually, chimpanzees are apes, along with orangutans, gorillas, and gibbons. And in fact, one of the weird things about <i>Planet</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Apes</i> is they don't have any gibbons in them. The orangutans that they claim are orangutans look like gibbons. And the way you distinguish apes from monkeys is apes have no tails and they're not exclusively arboreal.</p><p begin="00:44:07.01" data-timestamp="2647.01">And there was this pause. And I said, actually, there's a whole subset of other animals that are like monkeys called prosimians. And they include the lemur, and the tarsier, and the kinkajou, and the galago-- also called the bush baby-- and they're really goofy looking. And boy, if they had a <i>Planet</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Prosimians,</i> I would totally watch that movie.</p><p begin="00:44:29.58" data-timestamp="2669.58">And there was a further pause. And one of my friends said, oh, Dave, hey, speaking of animals, would you like to see the rat's ass that I give? And I thought, oh, that's my problem. I inform people against their will.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:44:55.95" data-timestamp="2695.95">So what you're saying is that the thing that can be very annoying in the real world is the same thing that makes you really good at solving puzzles?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Dickerson</h4><p begin="00:45:03.97" data-timestamp="2703.97">Yes, yes. Although I also feel obliged to point out that perhaps the more important point-- as far as I'm concerned-- is the thing that makes me annoying in the regular world is not annoying here. This environment is one of the only places where I can say something like that and not worry that I might be irritating someone by saying it, that even if it's not relevant, people at least understand the impulse.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:45:39.71" data-timestamp="2739.71">On a puzzle team, Dave can be himself only better. And I think this is true for a lot of people whose talents require the right context in which to shine. Think about it. A boxer without a boxing ring is just a guy punching people. In a puzzle competition, a guy with a mind for obscure facts can be a star.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Dickerson</h4><p begin="00:45:58.80" data-timestamp="2758.8">Yes.</p><p begin="00:45:59.30" data-timestamp="2759.3">[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 6</h4><p begin="00:46:03.76" data-timestamp="2763.76">Good job, guys.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 7</h4><p begin="00:46:04.75" data-timestamp="2764.75">Good work.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:46:08.67" data-timestamp="2768.67">Lisa Pollak.

And so they're constantly all about giving the right answer, and reading, and researching, and whatnot. And then there's something that happens to these girls at age 12 or 13 where it inverts.
