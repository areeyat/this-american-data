  <h3>Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.35" data-timestamp="0.35"> You may remember this story that we did about a year ago, about canvassers going door to door and talking to voters for 20 minutes. And in just 20 minutes, the canvassers got some voters to change their minds, to flip positions on big, hot button issues. Gay marriage. Abortion.</p><p begin="00:00:16.89" data-timestamp="16.89">Which, of course, is amazing, right? That is not something that seems like it's even possible. There was a study in a well-known, peer reviewed journal-- <i>Science</i> magazine-- proving how remarkably effective these people were. They invented a whole new way to sway voter opinion. It seemed like a game changer, a whole new tool for politics, for liberals or conservatives to use.</p><p begin="00:00:37.06" data-timestamp="37.06">And then a month after our radio story-- maybe you saw this in the news-- there was overwhelming evidence that one of the researchers, a grad student named Michael LaCour had fabricated all the data. <i>Science</i> magazine retracted the article.</p><p begin="00:00:52.05" data-timestamp="52.05">But the team that invented this canvassing technique, they were not the ones that did the research study. That was a separate thing. And they were just as shocked as anybody. Maybe more shocked.</p><p begin="00:01:00.82" data-timestamp="60.82">The week the news broke, one of the canvass organizers, Steve DeLine, told me they'd spent months meticulously going door to door and keeping perfect records of everything they were doing for this researcher. To find out that LaCour had just made up his part of the data--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Deline</h4><p begin="00:01:12.62" data-timestamp="72.62"> It's unfathomable to me, having you know, made sure that we were dotting every I and crossing every T. And you know, jumping through every hoop that he asked of us. It's just-- just can't really explain it. I'm at a loss.</p><p begin="00:01:31.35" data-timestamp="91.35"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:33.26" data-timestamp="93.26"> Then in August, three months after the retraction, four months after our story aired--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:38.60" data-timestamp="98.6"> Hi.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Fleischer</h4><p begin="00:01:39.74" data-timestamp="99.74"> Hi.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Deline</h4><p begin="00:01:40.57" data-timestamp="100.57">Steve.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Fleischer</h4><p begin="00:01:40.99" data-timestamp="100.99">Dave.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:41.47" data-timestamp="101.47">Hi.</p><p begin="00:01:41.87" data-timestamp="101.87"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Deline</h4><p begin="00:01:42.27" data-timestamp="102.27"> Nice to meet you.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:42.86" data-timestamp="102.86">Nice to meet you guys in person.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:01:43.87" data-timestamp="103.87"> We got a visitor to our office from two of the guys who'd developed this canvassing technique, that guy Steve and his coworker Dave Fleischer. They happened to be in town from California. And they had news.</p><p begin="00:01:54.43" data-timestamp="114.43">A brand new study with new researchers was looking into their work. Results were coming in. Here's Dave.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Fleischer</h4><p begin="00:01:59.18" data-timestamp="119.18"> We're not anticipating going public with these results until January at the earliest, and maybe not till June.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:07.59" data-timestamp="127.59"> What these researchers really wanted to do was publish their results in <i>Science</i> magazine, you know, the place that published the original, discredited study. In fact, one of the researchers was laying the groundwork for that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Fleischer</h4><p begin="00:02:17.38" data-timestamp="137.38">So he actually called up Marcia McNutt, who's the editor of <i>Science.</i> And they didn't immediately reject it out of hand. She just said, "You know, the bar's going to be very high." [LAUGHS] Well, no [BEEP] fooling.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:36.68" data-timestamp="156.68"> Well, apparently <i>Science</i> magazine liked what the new researchers did. This week they published the new study about these canvassers.</p><p begin="00:02:43.99" data-timestamp="163.99">This one's not fake. We know now, for real, whether those canvassers are, in fact, convincing anyone of anything when they go door to door. And if anything, what the canvassers are achieving and the way that they're achieving it is even more interesting than the fake study said.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One: Knock Knock. Who’s There? The Truth.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:58.69" data-timestamp="178.69">From WBEZ Chicago and <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life,</i> I'm Ira Glass. Today on our program, "For Your Reconsideration." We have this story and two other stories where people go back and revisit evidence from the past. And just to start this off, in case you didn't hear our first story about those canvassers a year ago, here's what they were. If you heard that show, this will just be a quick reminder.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:03:17.81" data-timestamp="197.81"> Hi. We're talking to registered voters in your neighborhood today about their views on abortion.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:23.08" data-timestamp="203.08">This is one of the canvassers. She's young, with tattoos and a halter top. It's a warm Los Angeles day, and the voter's on the other side of a screen door. She's older, heavyset, wire rimmed glasses. She's a nurse.</p><p begin="00:03:35.48" data-timestamp="215.48">And OK, just to be clear, what you're about to hear is a real canvasser with a real voter. This is not part of the discredited study. This is from a video of one of the regular canvasses these guys Dave and Steve organized. The canvasser begins by asking this voter what she believes about abortion on a scale from zero to 10.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:03:52.38" data-timestamp="232.38">Zero means you think women should have no access to abortion. 10 means women should have full access to abortion.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:00.01" data-timestamp="240.01"> The voter says zero. No access. No abortions for anybody. She's Catholic, from Mexico.</p><p begin="00:04:06.28" data-timestamp="246.28">And they start talking about how hard it can be to discuss abortion. Even with family.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:04:10.06" data-timestamp="250.06"> How did that feel for you to talk to your daughters?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Voter</h4><p begin="00:04:12.42" data-timestamp="252.42"> It's not easy. It's not easy, because in my country they have taboos, a lot of taboos. And my mother is one of the person never talking about sexual relations or conceptions.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:04:28.35" data-timestamp="268.35">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Voter</h4><p begin="00:04:29.30" data-timestamp="269.3">That's why I try to be very open with my daughters.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:32.45" data-timestamp="272.45"> Notice that this conversation's just begun and already she's talking about her daughters and her mom. That's no accident. This whole technique is built around having a very personal conversation, a very real conversation about the voter's experiences. To make that happen, this canvasser does something that a lot of the canvassers do-- she talks about her own experiences.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:04:50.35" data-timestamp="290.35"> My mother's from the Philippines.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Voter</h4><p begin="00:04:52.94" data-timestamp="292.94">Uh-huh.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:04:53.27" data-timestamp="293.27"> And my mother went through the same thing. Like, it's not something that you talk about.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Voter</h4><p begin="00:04:59.13" data-timestamp="299.13">No. It's not.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:05:00.30" data-timestamp="300.3">Huh.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Voter</h4><p begin="00:05:00.60" data-timestamp="300.6">In my family, it's the same.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:05:01.69" data-timestamp="301.69"> When I got my period, I was 12 years old.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Voter</h4><p begin="00:05:04.90" data-timestamp="304.9"> Mhm.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:05:05.57" data-timestamp="305.57">And--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:06.32" data-timestamp="306.32"> The voter tells her that when she was 11 and got her period, nobody explained what was happening. She thought she was dying.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Voter</h4><p begin="00:05:12.06" data-timestamp="312.06">And I believe I am dying. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:05:15.09" data-timestamp="315.09">Oh! [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:16.06" data-timestamp="316.06">And when she was six, her mom miscarried a baby. But nobody explained what was going on to her. And so she's tried to be different with her daughters and talk to them. That's why she became a nurse, she says, to help women.</p><p begin="00:05:27.85" data-timestamp="327.85">So these two strangers are swapping stories and really talking from the heart. And 15 minutes into this 22-minute conversation, the canvasser circles back to the subject at hand in a very pointed way.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:05:38.60" data-timestamp="338.6"> I had an abortion.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Voter</h4><p begin="00:05:40.27" data-timestamp="340.27">Mhm.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:05:40.68" data-timestamp="340.68"> In November this past year.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Voter</h4><p begin="00:05:42.50" data-timestamp="342.5">Oh, I'm so sorry.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:05:43.59" data-timestamp="343.59">And it wasn't the wrong choice for me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Voter</h4><p begin="00:05:46.32" data-timestamp="346.32">Mhm.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:05:46.99" data-timestamp="346.99"> Because that's what felt right for me. But I was alone.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Voter</h4><p begin="00:05:50.89" data-timestamp="350.89"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:05:51.80" data-timestamp="351.8">And it was scary.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Voter</h4><p begin="00:05:52.55" data-timestamp="352.55">Uh-huh.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:05:52.86" data-timestamp="352.86">And it wasn't-- it was because I don't know how to talk about it with people. Like, my family, my mother loves me. And so does my papa and my sister.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Voter</h4><p begin="00:06:01.54" data-timestamp="361.54">Mhm.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:06:02.13" data-timestamp="362.13">But--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Voter</h4><p begin="00:06:02.52" data-timestamp="362.52">I know, but it's hard. And you carry it for the rest of your life. It's your decision--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:06:07.86" data-timestamp="367.86"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Voter</h4><p begin="00:06:08.52" data-timestamp="368.52">But you carry it for the rest of your life.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:06:12.01" data-timestamp="372.01"> If you are-- one of the things that I struggled with with telling my family is this idea that my family's going to love me less.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Voter</h4><p begin="00:06:19.35" data-timestamp="379.35"> No. Never.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:06:20.80" data-timestamp="380.8">Would you ever love your daughters less?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Voter</h4><p begin="00:06:22.25" data-timestamp="382.25"> No. Never.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:24.30" data-timestamp="384.3">It's a moment that's simultaneously intimate and manipulative and honest all at once. And it works.</p><p begin="00:06:32.51" data-timestamp="392.51">After this, the canvasser asks the voter again to rate on a scale of zero to 10 where she stands on access to abortion. Remember, she was a zero before.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:06:40.07" data-timestamp="400.07"> We have that same zero to 10 scale where zero means no access and 10 means full access.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Voter</h4><p begin="00:06:45.97" data-timestamp="405.97">10.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Canvasser</h4><p begin="00:06:46.04" data-timestamp="406.04"> A 10?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Voter</h4><p begin="00:06:46.81" data-timestamp="406.81">Mhm.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:47.89" data-timestamp="407.89">She's been standing at the door just 18 minutes. So again, OK, that's real. That is not part of the fraudulent study.</p><p begin="00:06:54.51" data-timestamp="414.51">The team that invented this technique of going door to door-- including Dave Fleischer and Steve Deline, the two guys who visited our office at the beginning of this story-- they work at the Los Angeles LGBT Center, which is a big, multimillion-dollar nonprofit, the biggest LGBT organization in the world. They started doing these canvasses in 2009. They were hoping to change voters' minds to support gay marriage. This was in the wake of Proposition 8, which rejected gay marriage in California.</p><p begin="00:07:19.95" data-timestamp="439.95">And they discovered through trial and error that the trick to this whole thing was they don't try to reason with people about rights and equality and big principles like that. Canvass organizer Steve Deline says if you're talking at a kind of rational, sort of intellectual level about things, you're gonna fail.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Deline</h4><p begin="00:07:35.62" data-timestamp="455.62"> That's not where people make their decisions about issues like this. People make their decisions about how they're going to vote on this at a gut level and at a visceral level and an emotional level.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:46.32" data-timestamp="466.32">This is what they learned-- to stop telling people things. The most important thing the canvasser should do is listen.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Deline</h4><p begin="00:07:52.94" data-timestamp="472.94"> I think the big revelation was that our job was actually to go and give them the chance to talk about their own life, and realize that you know, maybe that led them to conclusions that were a little different than they'd thought.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:13.94" data-timestamp="493.94"> So they're out doing this, trying their canvasses. And it took them less than a year to start to get decent results like you heard with that nurse. A small but noticeable number of people at the door told them that their minds had been changed.</p><p begin="00:08:25.06" data-timestamp="505.06">But of course, the only way to tell for sure if their minds changed and stayed changed was to have outsiders-- scientists-- do a proper case control study. And that's why the canvassers invited in two political scientists to do the original study that was published in <i>Science</i> magazine. That grad student from UCLA-- Michael LaCour-- did the actual research. But the study design and results were overseen by a big deal political scientist from Columbia University named Donald Green, who's kind of legendary in that world for transforming how people do field experiments. And Green says that before they started, he expected the results were going to show--</p><p begin="00:09:00.44" data-timestamp="540.44"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Donald Green</h4><p begin="00:09:00.77" data-timestamp="540.77">Short-term effects. I thought that those effects would subside in a few days' time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:06.11" data-timestamp="546.11"> He thought that 'cause pretty much that's what always happens. People change their minds and then the effect wears off. Or much more common, they don't change their minds at all.</p><p begin="00:09:14.64" data-timestamp="554.64">There's a hefty body of research documenting something called the backfire effect, which happens with most of us. When we're confronted with evidence disproving something that we personally believe, most of us generally just dig in, and we believe it more.</p><p begin="00:09:27.30" data-timestamp="567.3">This is a phenomenon, by the way, that's familiar to anybody who's ever been to a Thanksgiving dinner during an election year and tried to argue with some favorite uncle's wrongheaded political opinions. Never works, right? Facts mean nothing. And by the way, Uncle Lenny, I am not talking about you.</p><p begin="00:09:42.04" data-timestamp="582.04">But this is what was so revolutionary about the data that this grad student seemed to be gathering about these canvassers. He said he did online surveys with the voters who got visited by the canvassers and they showed that their minds changed and stayed changed for six months, nine months, a year after the canvasser knocked at the door.</p><p begin="00:10:01.26" data-timestamp="601.26">Green told me that he and his colleagues had read through over 900 papers, never seen anything like this result, to change people's opinions and have it last like this. Though interestingly, when LaCour first showed his data to Professor Green, Green thought, this data is so perfect, these results might be real. But OK, best to be sure.</p><p begin="00:10:19.00" data-timestamp="619">And he told LaCour to do the entire study-- canvasses, surveys, everything-- a second time. Which LaCour did. Same result.</p><p begin="00:10:26.71" data-timestamp="626.71">Now, of course, later, Green's suspicions would be confirmed in spades. All that data would be shown to be fraudulent. But here's what LaCour said he found in the original study published in <i>Science</i>.</p><p begin="00:10:37.39" data-timestamp="637.39">OK, so what I'm about to say is from the discredited results of a retracted study. This study was about gay marriage. It was about convincing people to support gay marriage. And the study claimed that a year after the canvassers visited voters' homes, the number of voters supporting gay marriage had jumped 15%. 15%.</p><p begin="00:10:56.36" data-timestamp="656.36">But-- and this was key-- according to the study, the 15% increase only happened if the canvasser at the door had been gay and admitted being gay to the voter. People who talked to other canvassers only rose 3%, which is about as much as the nation as a whole changed on the issue of gay marriage that year.</p><p begin="00:11:16.11" data-timestamp="676.11">It was a similar effect with abortion, according LaCour. He said the number of people who became pro-choice after the canvass rose 5%. And again, the effect only lasted if the canvasser at the door revealed that she had had an abortion. It was talking to somebody affected by the issue that seemed to be changing people's minds.</p><p begin="00:11:44.01" data-timestamp="704.01">I actually interviewed Michael LaCour a year ago for the story that I did for our show about all this. I have to say, it's strange listening to that interview today, knowing what happened just a few weeks after we talked, that his data would be shown to be fraudulent. 'Cause when I talked to him, he really talked like somebody doing a real study with real surveys. Like for instance, I asked him how attitudes towards abortion changed over time among the voters that he was studying.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michael Lacour</h4><p begin="00:12:08.23" data-timestamp="728.23"> So that's still ongoing. Because I'm tracking longitudinally these individuals over a course. I don't want to give out a hard number, but it stays relatively flat. And I think it levels off around five percentage points. That's around 200 days later.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:24.60" data-timestamp="744.6">He offered conclusions from his data. Like this one.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michael Lacour</h4><p begin="00:12:27.14" data-timestamp="747.14"> So one of the things is people change their-- when they had contact with a gay person discussing gay equality-- they changed their minds, not just about the policy issue about same sex marriage. They also changed their minds about gay people, gays and lesbians as a group.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:41.40" data-timestamp="761.4"> Nice if that were true. If there were data supporting it.</p><p begin="00:12:45.33" data-timestamp="765.33">Or there was this finding, which is so particular and specific that again, if there is no data supporting this, it's just a very idiosyncratic thing to decide to say is true. LaCour said that he graded each gay canvasser on how stereotypically gay they appeared. And--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michael Lacour</h4><p begin="00:13:00.60" data-timestamp="780.6"> The gay canvassers who are perceived as straight had the largest effects.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:06.91" data-timestamp="786.91"> That is, they were able to convince the most voters to support gay marriage.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michael Lacour</h4><p begin="00:13:10.12" data-timestamp="790.12"> So this suggests that voters may ordinarily have an unflattering mental image of a stereotypical gay person. And the discrepancy between the stereotype and the person standing on the doorstep creates a space for attitude change.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:25.07" data-timestamp="805.07">Right. I see.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michael Lacour</h4><p begin="00:13:26.50" data-timestamp="806.5"> Especially when the canvassers are building empathy through respectful two-way conversation.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:31.82" data-timestamp="811.82"> This vision of the world is such a hopeful vision of how the world might work. The world LaCour fabricated is one where intolerant people hold inaccurate stereotypes in their heads and all it takes is an empathetic conversation, one sincere talk, 20 minutes long, with somebody from the stereotyped group and the scales fall from their eyes.

Green had just reconsidered what was going on in the data LaCour had collected and had asked <i>Science</i> to retract their article, which the magazine did. He seemed understandably sobered and sad.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Donald Green</h4><p begin="00:14:38.82" data-timestamp="878.82"> It was such a waste. Not just of my time, obviously, but no, the Center and the canvassers' time.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:14:46.82" data-timestamp="886.82">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Donald Green</h4><p begin="00:14:47.18" data-timestamp="887.18"> It's just crazy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:14:48.66" data-timestamp="888.66">The way the fraud was discovered was actually a little detective story of its own. A detective story that began kind of exactly the way they tell you in school that the scientific method is supposed to work.</p><p begin="00:14:58.54" data-timestamp="898.54">Two young researchers-- David Broockman and Joshua Kalla, both in their 20s-- tried to replicate what LaCour did. The  team from the Los Angeles LGBT Center and a Miami LGBT group was organizing a new canvass operation in Miami. Broockman and Kalla would study that.</p><p begin="00:15:13.56" data-timestamp="913.56">Broockman was already suspicious of LaCour's data. It seemed too perfect. Then they started their research and they noticed something funny.</p><p begin="00:15:20.21" data-timestamp="920.21">The way this experiment works, like I said, the researchers do online surveys of the voters' opinions before and after the canvassers come to their doors and talk to them. And the researchers pay the voters to fill out those online surveys to motivate them to do the surveys. And tons of voters filled out LaCour's surveys, but not Broockman and Kalla's.</p><p begin="00:15:40.97" data-timestamp="940.97">This made no sense at all. And they didn't know what to do. If people didn't fill out their surveys, they'd have no study. They started to panic.</p><p begin="00:15:48.85" data-timestamp="948.85">So they reached out to the survey company that LaCour said he used to find out exactly how LaCour got so many people to fill in their surveys. The company informed them that LaCour was not one of their clients, that the employee LaCour said he worked with did not exist, and in fact, this company did not have the capability to do the things LaCour said they did for him.</p><p begin="00:16:10.30" data-timestamp="970.3">The hundreds of thousands of dollars that was supposedly paid out to survey responders, which LaCour said came from funders like the Ford Foundation-- who LaCour thanked in his study-- never was actually granted to LaCour. Given all that, it was hard to see how any of the data could be real.</p><p begin="00:16:25.75" data-timestamp="985.75">But LaCour held firm. Said the data was real. He even wrote a paper defending it. But he said that he could not show the data to anybody because he had destroyed all the original surveys to protect the privacy of the respondents.</p><p begin="00:16:40.03" data-timestamp="1000.03">I'm not sure anybody believed him. He'd been headed for a prestigious job at Princeton University after finishing his doctoral thesis. Now that job evaporated.

Since all this went down last year, Michael LaCour still has not admitted to fabricating data in public or in private with the colleagues of his that I've spoken to. He declined my invitation to come on the radio this week and talk about this. He declined to say whether the data was real or fake.</p><p begin="00:21:37.00" data-timestamp="1297">The one chink in this position came last month, when out of the blue he texted Dave Fleischer. "Hi Dave. If you're willing, I'd like to meet with you face to face. To apologize." Dave told me he hasn't been able to bring himself to respond just yet. He's not ready.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Broockman</h4><p begin="00:21:59.98" data-timestamp="1319.98"> Yeah, so what we've done so far is the Miami work. I think that's what we're ready to show you some of the early sneak peek into. I think you're the first person outside of the study--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:22:10.34" data-timestamp="1330.34">That's David Broockman, one of the guys who discovered the fraud in the original study, and the co-author of the new study with real surveys and real data that was published this week in <i>Science</i> magazine. This recording has him talking to me last August, three months after <i>Science</i> retracted the original study.</p><p begin="00:22:25.42" data-timestamp="1345.42">It was Broockman and his research partner remember, who discovered LaCour's fraud when they tried to replicate his methods in Miami. Now the Miami data was in, the first part of it anyway.</p><p begin="00:22:34.82" data-timestamp="1354.82">The canvassers in Miami went door to door trying to change voters' attitudes about transgendered people. Miami-Dade County passed an ordinance in 2014 banning discrimination against transgender people. And these canvassers were trying to convince voters that that was a good idea, and to support it if a ballot measure someday tried to strike it down. And they succeeded.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Broockman</h4><p begin="00:22:55.33" data-timestamp="1375.33"> And you see just a huge increase in the acceptance towards transgender people. And overall, what you see is it's basically the largest effect I've ever seen for any political tactic. So much more than phone calls or mail or other forms of canvassing that I've seen. The effect is just huge.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:23:16.67" data-timestamp="1396.67"> In other words, the thing that was so exciting about the discredited study turned out to be true. These canvasses can change people's minds. For real.</p><p begin="00:23:26.71" data-timestamp="1406.71">Roughly one out of 10 voters changed their attitudes about transgender people. As the study notes, it took from 1998 to 2012-- 14 years-- for the country as a whole to have a comparable change in its attitudes towards gay people. It only took the canvassers 20 minutes or less to do this for trans people. Broockman said the only political tactic that has ever been shown to be more effective than this in affecting attitudes is personally meeting somebody who's running for office, which of course, is a very different kind of thing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Broockman</h4><p begin="00:23:55.81" data-timestamp="1435.81"> More impressive is that the effect appears to last, that you basically see the exact same pattern of results six weeks later. We're going to start measuring again at, I think we decided three months and six months. So who knows if these will continue to last into the future?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:24:12.59" data-timestamp="1452.59">They did. Three months later, attitudes stayed changed. Again, same as the discredited study.</p><p begin="00:24:19.28" data-timestamp="1459.28">But where it gets really interesting is the stuff that the new guys found that is different from the original study. First difference? Remember how the original study said that only a gay canvasser could convince a voter to support gay marriage? And only a woman who talked about her own abortion could convince a voter to become pro-choice? David Broockman says on these trans issues--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Broockman</h4><p begin="00:24:39.70" data-timestamp="1479.7"> That's not what we're finding at all. We see that both transgender and non-transgender canvassers are effective, and they're similarly effective.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:24:47.46" data-timestamp="1487.46"> Which is a profoundly different finding from the original discredited study. The original study seemed to say that it was meeting somebody, relating to a gay person or a trans person or whoever that changed people's attitudes. It was empathy that did the trick. But this new study says it's something else entirely.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Broockman</h4><p begin="00:25:05.28" data-timestamp="1505.28"> Really what's happening here is it's listening and asking questions to voters to get them to say the words and to get them to do the mental work to think through how the experiences they have had are relevant to this issue.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:17.36" data-timestamp="1517.36"> In other words, there's this ideal of well, if you just met a gay person--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Broockman</h4><p begin="00:25:20.60" data-timestamp="1520.6">That's right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:20.88" data-timestamp="1520.88">Then you'd have this feeling. You're saying nah, that's not it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Broockman</h4><p begin="00:25:23.33" data-timestamp="1523.33"> The idea is that if the words come out of your own mouth, it's much more meaningful to you than if they come out of somebody else's mouth.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:31.62" data-timestamp="1531.62">That's so funny, 'cause like, who do you believe? Oh, I believe myself.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Broockman</h4><p begin="00:25:34.24" data-timestamp="1534.24"> Exactly. So it's not that this isn't common sense. But it's also not what any campaigns do.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:39.20" data-timestamp="1539.2"> Broockman and his co-author have also been working on a study of the abortion canvasses organized by the Los Angeles LGBT Center. And here's another difference from the original discredited research done by Michael LaCour. Broockman has found the abortion canvasses failed. They didn't actually convince people.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Broockman</h4><p begin="00:25:56.13" data-timestamp="1556.13">Zero.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:56.63" data-timestamp="1556.63"> No effect.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Broockman</h4><p begin="00:25:57.80" data-timestamp="1557.8">No effect for anybody.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:58.93" data-timestamp="1558.93"> No effect for anyone.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Broockman</h4><p begin="00:26:00.30" data-timestamp="1560.3"> Right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:26:01.78" data-timestamp="1561.78"> How do you explain that this worked with the trans issue, but it didn't work with the abortion issue?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Broockman</h4><p begin="00:26:08.31" data-timestamp="1568.31">Well, I think there's a lot of possibilities. One possibility is that trans issues are so new, whereas abortion is so ingrained that it was just easier. Like--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:26:19.13" data-timestamp="1579.13">In other words, people haven't really formed very firm opinions about trans issues--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Broockman</h4><p begin="00:26:22.59" data-timestamp="1582.59">Exactly.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:26:23.01" data-timestamp="1583.01">Whereas everybody knows where they stand. Every adult knows whether they're for or against abortion rights.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Broockman</h4><p begin="00:26:27.42" data-timestamp="1587.42">Right. So I think that's possible.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:26:31.68" data-timestamp="1591.68"> The other possibility, of course, is that canvass organizers just haven't figured out yet how to talk about abortion at the doorstep in a way that lastingly convinces anyone. We tried very hard, by the way. Somebody actually flew to Los Angeles to locate that nurse that you heard at the beginning of the program to find out if she went back to her old pro-life beliefs after the canvasser walked away from the door. But we couldn't find her.</p><p begin="00:26:54.98" data-timestamp="1614.98">I will say in videos of the Miami canvass, one thing that's really striking is how malleable people do seem to be on the transgender issues in this way that's very hard to imagine on abortion rights. Sometimes a canvasser has to explain to the voters exactly what transgender means. They have to show videos to be sure that it's understood what it is that they're even talking about. Or take this man, an older voter with a kind face who stands at his doorstep in a sleeveless undershirt telling that same canvasser that you heard at the beginning of the program--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Voter</h4><p begin="00:27:23.44" data-timestamp="1643.44"> There is one thing that disturb me.

If the caller decides to get off the line before the hour is up, if they get annoyed or mad or tired of Chris, that's totally fine. But Chris, he's in it for the duration.</p><p begin="00:31:30.22" data-timestamp="1890.22">In this call you're about to hear, you can feel him at the beginning getting his bearings, so it's a little meandering.

[LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:47:33.63" data-timestamp="2853.63">So is every story in this book a kid being like, oh I did this dumb ass thing, now I know better, don't do what I did?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:47:40.69" data-timestamp="2860.69"> Yeah, precisely.

He was 10 years old, I think, when he wrote this about an experience he had when he was five.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:47:55.31" data-timestamp="2875.31">So he did some dumb ass thing?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:47:56.93" data-timestamp="2876.93"> Basically he was-- [LAUGHS] I guess he was playing in his yard on his swing set. And I remember this swing set. It was there when we were growing up. It's got a fort part to it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:06.29" data-timestamp="2886.29">Mhm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:48:06.48" data-timestamp="2886.48">This was slightly before I met him, I believe.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:08.91" data-timestamp="2888.91">Mhm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:48:09.33" data-timestamp="2889.33">And he and his friend Michelle, for some reason they got it in their mind that it would be cool to make some kind of wall around this fort by wrapping string all the way around the fort many, many times. And at some point, they decided OK, it's time to cut the string off. So Michelle asked him to get some scissors.</p><p begin="00:48:28.16" data-timestamp="2908.16">Christopher knew where the scissors were. They were in the drawer in the kitchen somewhere. So he ran inside, he got the scissors, he brought them out.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:34.04" data-timestamp="2914.04">Oh no. I feel-- now that scissors have entered the scene, now I feel worried.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:48:37.09" data-timestamp="2917.09">[LAUGHS] Yes. And you should.</p><p begin="00:48:39.50" data-timestamp="2919.5">So then Michelle began cutting some of the string. And Christopher, to hear him tell it, basically wanted to get a closer look. And she cut towards his eye, and the scissors went into his left eye.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:55.24" data-timestamp="2935.24"> [WHISPERS] Oh my god!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:48:56.61" data-timestamp="2936.61"> Just right in there.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:58.28" data-timestamp="2938.28"> Poor kid.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:48:59.62" data-timestamp="2939.62"> He says he actually didn't really feel pain, amazingly. But he did know something was wrong. There was fluid coming down out of his eye. Anyway, he needed very serious eye surgery. He was in the hospital for days.</p><p begin="00:49:12.72" data-timestamp="2952.72">So the thing about his story and about so many of these stories that I really love is one, the tone of them. [LAUGHS] They were written-- just imagine a five-year-old or an eight-year-old writing a war story. Just kind of telling it. Like, imagine them sitting in a bar like sidled up with like whiskey and they're a 10-year-old talking about the time they had scissors shoved into their eye.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:35.21" data-timestamp="2975.21"> So it's not just kids looking back. It's kids looking back with an unnatural seriousness that's being pressed on them by the adults who are writing the book?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:49:42.43" data-timestamp="2982.43"> Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, that's what's happening.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:44.41" data-timestamp="2984.41">Let's hear what it sounds like. Here, read what your friend writes.

(GRAVELY) "The scissors jerked back and poked me right in the eye. I don't remember much of what followed, except that my mom and dad took me to St. Vincent Hospital where Dr. Mark Steckel did surgery on my eye. I learned not to put my eyes near any sharp objects.

[LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:50:30.22" data-timestamp="3030.22">And even when I remember talking to Chris about it, the lesson of this story was don't lean into scissors that are cutting a particularly taut piece of string because you could get poked in the eye.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:41.53" data-timestamp="3041.53">[LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:50:41.79" data-timestamp="3041.79"> That's what he took away from the story.

It's actually written in the third person-- which is interesting, it's an interesting take about another child.</p><p begin="00:52:09.45" data-timestamp="3129.45">"When Karen was three, she was just trying to show off for two other cousins when they were watching TV. She took the leftover kernels from the bottom of the bowl of popcorn and stuck two kernels up her small nostrils. She kept them up there for about a minute and got a couple laughs.</p><p begin="00:52:24.53" data-timestamp="3144.53">Then she tried to take them out. She tried so hard her nostrils were as red as blood. In the emergency room, they had no idea how she got them in there. The doctors decided to stick the tweezers up her nose while she was pushing with her index fingers from the top to bottom. Finally, the kernels popped out. I dearly suggest that you never stick popcorn kernels up your nose to be funny, because it's a serious accident."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:46.47" data-timestamp="3166.47">[LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:52:47.35" data-timestamp="3167.35">[LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:49.12" data-timestamp="3169.12"> So what do you like about that one so much?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:52:51.77" data-timestamp="3171.77">Again, I just love the specificity of it. Like, if I were to go through that or witness it as an adult, if I were to try and tell someone to watch out, I'd been there, you don't want to go through what I went through, I might say, don't stick foreign objects up your nose of any kind.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:06.25" data-timestamp="3186.25"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:53:07.67" data-timestamp="3187.67"> But the lesson that this 12-year-old draws is don't stick popcorn kernels up your nose to be funny.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:15.79" data-timestamp="3195.79"> OK. So kids do not generalize. That is what I've learned from this so far.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:53:19.35" data-timestamp="3199.35">Yeah, apparently not. And actually, I talked to my friend Christopher about what happened to him. And we were reading through the book together. And his mom actually happened to be there too, 'cause she was visiting him. And she was a first grade teacher for many, many years before she retired.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:31.68" data-timestamp="3211.68">Oh.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:53:32.02" data-timestamp="3212.02">And she totally confirmed this. She was like, yeah. This is something I dealt with day in, day out.</p><p begin="00:53:35.65" data-timestamp="3215.65">And actually, they told me a story that I did not know in all the years I've known him that illustrates this perfectly. There is apparently a sequel to the earlier scissors story.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris's Mother</h4><p begin="00:53:47.87" data-timestamp="3227.87"> Brian, as his mother, I'd like to interject that he's learned not to put his eyes near sharp things. But he never learned not to put his fingers near sharp things. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:53:57.99" data-timestamp="3237.99"> So I guess two years after he got hospitalized for scissors, he was at school. The school day was ending. He was waiting for the bus with kids in his class.</p><p begin="00:54:08.75" data-timestamp="3248.75">And somehow he and this girl were playing, and there was a pair of scissors around. He was very insistent that they were safety scissors, like the kind of plasticky, rounded-edge ones or whatever.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:23.91" data-timestamp="3263.91">Right. Sure.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:54:24.97" data-timestamp="3264.97">And somehow they were playing with these. And the question of are these dangerous or not came up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Christopher Alesevich</h4><p begin="00:54:29.94" data-timestamp="3269.94"> I looked at these special scissors, and they were very dull. They had rounded tips, and so they were not sharp, as where my previous lesson was that sharp scissors are dangerous. And so therefore, not-sharp scissors are not dangerous.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:54:44.84" data-timestamp="3284.84">How old were you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Christopher Alesevich</h4><p begin="00:54:45.68" data-timestamp="3285.68">So this was second grade. I must have been--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris's Mother</h4><p begin="00:54:47.77" data-timestamp="3287.77">You were probably seven. But you're a January birthday, so--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Christopher Alesevich</h4><p begin="00:54:50.45" data-timestamp="3290.45">So not only was I so sure that scissors that didn't look sharp were not dangerous, but then I had to prove to another person my knowledge of this matter and to show off that hey, you're wrong. These scissors are not dangerous.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:55:05.57" data-timestamp="3305.57"> It's amazing that the very serious lesson you'd been taught by being hospitalized a couple years earlier, the lesson you'd been taught to specifically watch yourself around scissors was the thing that inspired you to be extra braggadocious--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Christopher Alesevich</h4><p begin="00:55:22.30" data-timestamp="3322.3">Confident. That's right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:55:23.02" data-timestamp="3323.02"> --and careless around scissors.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris's Mother</h4><p begin="00:55:24.49" data-timestamp="3324.49"> Yes. Yes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Christopher Alesevich</h4><p begin="00:55:25.92" data-timestamp="3325.92"> So what I did, I stuck out my hand and my finger, and I was like, here cut. It's not going to cut.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:55:32.28" data-timestamp="3332.28">[LAUGHS] God.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Christopher Alesevich</h4><p begin="00:55:33.13" data-timestamp="3333.13"> Lo and behold, it cut my finger. I was like, "oh, crap!"</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris's Mother</h4><p begin="00:55:37.65" data-timestamp="3337.65">[LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Christopher Alesevich</h4><p begin="00:55:38.14" data-timestamp="3338.14"> [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:55:39.11" data-timestamp="3339.11"> So I guess his parents had to get called by the principal. He couldn't go home on the bus 'cause he was bleeding quite profusely. Again, his parents had to be told, "Christopher has had an incident with scissors." [LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:55:50.91" data-timestamp="3350.91">He was fine. But you know.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:55:54.22" data-timestamp="3354.22">So what was the lesson of that accident?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Christopher Alesevich</h4><p begin="00:55:58.09" data-timestamp="3358.09"> So the lesson of that accident is that all scissors are sharp, regardless of whether they look sharp or not.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:56:04.75" data-timestamp="3364.75">[LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Christopher Alesevich</h4><p begin="00:56:05.59" data-timestamp="3365.59">And actually I did internalize that lesson. And I'd like to point out, there has not been a third scissors incident.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:56:12.44" data-timestamp="3372.44"> And a good 25 years have gone by.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris's Mother</h4><p begin="00:56:14.58" data-timestamp="3374.58">Mhm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Christopher Alesevich</h4><p begin="00:56:15.02" data-timestamp="3375.02">Yeah.
