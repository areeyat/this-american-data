  <h3>Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.54" data-timestamp="0.54">One of the producers of our radio program, Sean Cole, used to live in Toronto. And he went out to bars a lot when he was there. And at one point, he heard this rumor about the places that he was hanging out.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:00:11.34" data-timestamp="11.34">A friend of mine basically said, the thing about these bars-- he actually said, the gasoline that allows them to function was cocaine.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:21.45" data-timestamp="21.45">Meaning the staff was doing cocaine?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:00:23.05" data-timestamp="23.05">The bartenders were on coke. And I was like, how did I not notice? You know?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:27.42" data-timestamp="27.42">Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:00:27.88" data-timestamp="27.88">And I wondered how true that was.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:00:29.53" data-timestamp="29.53">Did you do any coke tonight?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bartender 1</h4><p begin="00:00:31.41" data-timestamp="31.41">Yeah. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:00:33.56" data-timestamp="33.56">How much?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bartender 1</h4><p begin="00:00:34.37" data-timestamp="34.37">Just a bump.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:00:35.71" data-timestamp="35.71">So that's like, what is that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bartender 1</h4><p begin="00:00:37.28" data-timestamp="37.28">That's like the tip of a key.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:00:39.27" data-timestamp="39.27">So this is one of about a dozen bartenders that I interviewed, all anonymously.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:43.14" data-timestamp="43.14">When she says a key, she means like--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:00:45.00" data-timestamp="45">Like a house key. You sniff it off of that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bartender 1</h4><p begin="00:00:47.32" data-timestamp="47.32">But I have done it while I'm working. But I don't do it until later, like past 1:00.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:00:51.50" data-timestamp="51.5">Oh, I see.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bartender 1</h4><p begin="00:00:52.51" data-timestamp="52.51">Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:00:52.84" data-timestamp="52.84">And how often does that happen?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bartender 1</h4><p begin="00:00:54.03" data-timestamp="54.03">Umm, like, every weekend.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:05.17" data-timestamp="65.17">I had this experience years ago. A friend sat me down and told me that she'd just started going to AA. And she wanted me to know that she knew how annoying it must have been for me and all of our friends at the time that she was always on coke back when we first were getting to know each other.</p><p begin="00:01:19.13" data-timestamp="79.13">She was running to the bathroom all the time. She was really hyper. And I told her, I had no idea. I told her, I just assumed that's your personality. You're a little manic, small bladder. And of course, right?</p><p begin="00:01:32.12" data-timestamp="92.12">I think, if you're not a daily drug user, you're not a big drug user, it doesn't occur to you that the people around you might be high. And Sean found that this bar scene he thought he knew so well did, actually, seem to be run on cocaine.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:01:46.28" data-timestamp="106.28">So lots of bars in certain areas of town, definitely, coke is like fuel for the staff. Partly because, you know, these bars, it's like drinking on the job is kind of expected.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bartender 2</h4><p begin="00:01:59.97" data-timestamp="119.97">People are buying me shots. And I see people I know, and I'm buying them shots. And then, just, you start to get the spins.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bartender 1</h4><p begin="00:02:07.48" data-timestamp="127.48">It's like, after you do four or five shots, I'm like, OK. I don't want to be too drunk. I need something to straighten me up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bartender 2</h4><p begin="00:02:13.35" data-timestamp="133.35">Jeez, I really want a line right now to straighten this up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:02:16.03" data-timestamp="136.03">That's the phrase you keep hearing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bartender 3</h4><p begin="00:02:17.23" data-timestamp="137.23">Everyone uses it so loosely. It's straightening out. You need to straighten out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bartender 2</h4><p begin="00:02:21.07" data-timestamp="141.07">Yeah, you just take a quick little jump down to the bathroom, straighten yourself up. Come upstairs.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:02:25.79" data-timestamp="145.79">How often does that happen to you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bartender 2</h4><p begin="00:02:27.60" data-timestamp="147.6">Uh, eight minutes ago.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:02:29.92" data-timestamp="149.92">OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bartender 2</h4><p begin="00:02:30.44" data-timestamp="150.44">[LAUGHS] Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:35.31" data-timestamp="155.31">So their bosses have to know, right?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:02:37.12" data-timestamp="157.12">The bosses are doing it too sometimes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bartender 3</h4><p begin="00:02:39.39" data-timestamp="159.39">For the first little while, the bar I worked at, the managers were doing lines of cocaine in order to sober up enough so they could cash out the bartenders, who were completely inebriated. Oh! I also knew policemen who were partaking.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:02:56.06" data-timestamp="176.06">In cocaine?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bartender 3</h4><p begin="00:02:56.83" data-timestamp="176.83">In the bathroom, with the manager, in uniform. It blew me away! I was so naive. I was like, what? It would be like finding out Superman is-- you know--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:03:06.65" data-timestamp="186.65">Doing cocaine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bartender 3</h4><p begin="00:03:07.47" data-timestamp="187.47">--doing cocaine! Exactly.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:12.45" data-timestamp="192.45">Of course, to put it in perspective, this is a cop doing cocaine in a city whose mayor was caught on video smoking crack and stayed in his job. He's finally going to rehab now. And all of this got us thinking here at the radio show, how many people around us are high right now? Like, right this second?</p><p begin="00:03:34.18" data-timestamp="214.18">OK, if you're out in the world right now as you're hearing me say these words, look around at the people around you. Look at their faces. Could one of them be high? And I mean, everywhere you go, right? It's like, for example, we found this book that came out a couple of years ago by a guy named Ethan Bryson.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Ethan Bryson</h4><p begin="00:03:49.07" data-timestamp="229.07">So the title of the book is <i>Addicted</i> <i>Healers.</i> And the subtitle is "5 Key Signs Your Healthcare Professional May Be Drug Impaired."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:03:57.37" data-timestamp="237.37">And right here on page xviii, it says, "Rates of illicit drug use by health care professionals within the past year ranged from 8% to 20%, depending on the type of personnel within the health care industry." And then, it says, "At any given time, roughly 3% to 5% of this population is using illicit drugs while they are caring for patients."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:24.80" data-timestamp="264.8">3% to 5%, you mean of all health care professionals?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:04:27.14" data-timestamp="267.14">All across the profession.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:28.51" data-timestamp="268.51">Wow, which drugs?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:04:30.91" data-timestamp="270.91">They all have their drug of choice. And we actually played this kind of word association game.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:04:36.36" data-timestamp="276.36">Physicians?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Ethan Bryson</h4><p begin="00:04:37.56" data-timestamp="277.56">Pills, Oxycontin, oxycodone.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:04:41.27" data-timestamp="281.27">Nurses.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Ethan Bryson</h4><p begin="00:04:42.43" data-timestamp="282.43">Intravenous opioid-based drugs.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:04:45.34" data-timestamp="285.34">Psychiatrists.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Ethan Bryson</h4><p begin="00:04:46.90" data-timestamp="286.9">Benzodiazepines.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:04:48.68" data-timestamp="288.68">Anesthesiologists.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Ethan Bryson</h4><p begin="00:04:49.92" data-timestamp="289.92">Fentanyl.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:04:50.94" data-timestamp="290.94">You said that so fast!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Ethan Bryson</h4><p begin="00:04:52.98" data-timestamp="292.98">That is the biggest drug.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:04:55.40" data-timestamp="295.4">I should point out here that Dr. Bryson is himself an anesthesiologist.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:04:59.32" data-timestamp="299.32">Say it again, fentanyl?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Ethan Bryson</h4><p begin="00:05:00.47" data-timestamp="300.47">Fentanyl. It's a highly potent derivative of morphine.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:05:07.21" data-timestamp="307.21">It's actually like 80 times more potent than morphine and can significantly mess with your judgment. It's extremely addictive. And Dr. Bryson pointed out that most medical professionals don't have to take drug tests. Military personnel, on the other hand, do.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Deborah Lee James</h4><p begin="00:05:24.66" data-timestamp="324.66">Now, many of you reported last week on the investigation involving some of our airmen and illegal drug possession.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:05:31.95" data-timestamp="331.95">This is the Secretary of the Air Force, Deborah Lee James, giving a press conference a few months ago. Basically, two lieutenants were busted for allegedly dealing amphetamines and ecstasy. And they were found out, because they were sending text messages to other airmen about drugs.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Deborah Lee James</h4><p begin="00:05:49.19" data-timestamp="349.19">Well, it turns out that three of the 10 who were implicated in this drug investigation were from our Air Force Global Strike Command, which is the command where our ICBM missile forces reside.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:02.48" data-timestamp="362.48">ICBM, that is--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:06:03.89" data-timestamp="363.89">The nuclear warheads.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:05.35" data-timestamp="365.35">Well, that doesn't seem like somebody we want high.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:06:07.00" data-timestamp="367">Not someone we want high.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:13.89" data-timestamp="373.89">Sean, are there surveys measuring how many of us are high all the time?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:06:18.43" data-timestamp="378.43">I mean-- [SIGH] There's not a lot of data. There's workplace drug tests that show 3 and 1/2% of workers test positive for drugs. But obviously, that's only in workplaces that test for drugs in the first place.</p><p begin="00:06:32.28" data-timestamp="392.28">One of the experts on this data, who's wonderfully named, Dr. Barry Sample from Quest Diagnostics told me drug use is a couple percentage points higher in places that don't test for drugs.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:45.39" data-timestamp="405.39">Which jobs have the highest drug use?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:06:47.33" data-timestamp="407.33">So, the Department of Health and Human Services actually has numbers on that. The latest ones that I found said-- so this is people who say, yes, I've done illicit drugs in the past month. People who work in real estate is about 7%. Same for mining.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:02.56" data-timestamp="422.56">Mining? 7%.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:07:03.81" data-timestamp="423.81">Mining. Retail is 9 and 1/2%. Construction workers is about 14%. So that means roughly one in seven construction workers. The highest is accommodation and food services.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:18.52" data-timestamp="438.52">That would include, dare I say, bartenders? [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:07:21.43" data-timestamp="441.43">Yes. Accommodation and food services, roughly one in six admit on the survey to using drugs.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:30.55" data-timestamp="450.55">It could be higher, though, right?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:07:32.04" data-timestamp="452.04">It could be higher? What do you mean?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:34.08" data-timestamp="454.08">It could be higher than one of six actually do drugs.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:07:36.82" data-timestamp="456.82">Oh, it could be higher--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:38.45" data-timestamp="458.45">Right, one out of six--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:07:38.96" data-timestamp="458.96">--meaning one out of six admit on the survey--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:41.96" data-timestamp="461.96">--admit on the survey to drug use. Some more of them, actually, might be doing it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:07:45.76" data-timestamp="465.76">Yeah, maybe.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:46.89" data-timestamp="466.89">They should try the survey in Toronto.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:07:48.87" data-timestamp="468.87">[LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:56.47" data-timestamp="476.47">Well, today on our radio program, the secret world of getting high, which is, OK, maybe not such a well-kept secret. It is all around us all the time. High people mingling with us, working, passing, laughing extra hard at our jokes. We don't even know why.</p><p begin="00:08:12.22" data-timestamp="492.22">We have stories today of great drug experiences, and awful drug experiences, and funny drug experiences; tales of miscalculation, bad judgment, and dumb-assery.

  <h3>Act One: High on the Corporate Ladder</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:37.68" data-timestamp="517.68">Act One, High on the Corporate Ladder. So there's this secret society, many million strong, people who are going through life high. Maybe you are part of this society. If not, you're probably dealing regularly with people who are, cashiers, baristas, and stockbrokers, and cab drivers, maybe the cop writing that parking ticket. Alex Blumberg has this story about just how hard it is to tell who is in that society and who isn't.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:09:03.07" data-timestamp="543.07">Richard, for many years, was a member of that society, the society of people who get high at work.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard</h4><p begin="00:09:08.93" data-timestamp="548.93">I would roll a thin joint and start smoking in the morning. I'd usually duck down at one of the back stairways and take a few more tokes during the day. I'd smoke at lunch. I'd smoke a little bit in the afternoon. I would basically stay high all day long.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:09:28.44" data-timestamp="568.44">And what exactly was your job title?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard</h4><p begin="00:09:32.22" data-timestamp="572.22">I was chief operating [LAUGHS] officer of the second largest ad agency in town. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:09:45.62" data-timestamp="585.62">[LAUGHS] How many people at your company knew that you were doing this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard</h4><p begin="00:09:51.18" data-timestamp="591.18">Um, somewhere between three and all of them.</p><p begin="00:09:55.86" data-timestamp="595.86">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:09:58.58" data-timestamp="598.58">Richard says that, at the time, he thought he was hiding his habit. But in retrospect, who knows? One of the head executives toking up in the stairwell every day, how could he hide that? On the other hand, there's this. I had no idea that this was going  on. And I'm Richard's son.</p><p begin="00:10:19.25" data-timestamp="619.25">I only found out that my dad was getting high at work every day long after the fact, when I was in my 30s. And I found out because my dad got cancer. It was a horrible week. It started with the discovery that the pain in my dad's back wasn't just a pinched nerve. And it ended with a diagnosis of lymphoma, a particular form of lymphoma that we had learned that week to root for, because it's actually curable. That's the word they used. Back then, I didn't even know you could say that about cancer.</p><p begin="00:10:46.18" data-timestamp="646.18">But that whole week, my dad was convinced he had a different diagnosis, lung cancer. Even towards the end, when the doctors were pretty convinced the news was good, he insisted on it, which didn't make any sense. My father had quit smoking cigarettes way back in the '80s.</p><p begin="00:11:01.86" data-timestamp="661.86">When we pressed him about it, that's when he told us about the pot. My dad's cancer and recovery was a pivotal time for our family. Painful secrets came out. Much was said that needed to be said. My dad got into a 12-step program. And he's been clean for almost 15 years.</p><p begin="00:11:17.17" data-timestamp="677.17">But then, here at the radio show, someone suggested doing a show called "I was so high," and I realized something. I really wanted us to do that show. I had a lot of questions for people who got high all day, questions about what they thought of themselves, what they thought of their families, what they were getting out of being high. I realized, in other words, I had a lot of questions for my dad.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:11:36.89" data-timestamp="696.89">When did you use marijuana for the first time?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard</h4><p begin="00:11:41.66" data-timestamp="701.66">Uh, I don't know. You were about a year and a half old.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:11:46.51" data-timestamp="706.51">First, of course, I wanted the details. When did it start? When did it get serious? And for my dad, it started in the '60s. A friend rolled a joint at a party. It was fun. It became something he did socially, getting high with friends, listening to Jefferson Airplane on the brand new FM station in town.</p><p begin="00:12:01.74" data-timestamp="721.74">And this part I knew. I remember joints passed around when my parents' friends came over, rolling papers on the end table next to the couch. One afternoon, I answered the door and found a friend of my dad's, turtleneck, sunglasses, what I remember as a Burt Reynolds mustache. He handed me a dime-bag and said, this is for your father.</p><p begin="00:12:26.28" data-timestamp="746.28">My dad doesn't remember the first time he smoked weed at work. But it was probably around the time I was leaving middle school and entering high school. By the time I left for college, it had gone far beyond a thing he did at nights with friends to a thing he did routinely, during the day, while he'd walk the several blocks to a meeting with one of his firm's largest clients.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard</h4><p begin="00:12:42.98" data-timestamp="762.98">I knew where every alleyway between our office on Seventh Street and Procter, on the other corner of downtown.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:12:56.98" data-timestamp="776.98">And you're talking about a meeting with Procter &amp; Gamble--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard</h4><p begin="00:12:59.35" data-timestamp="779.35">Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:13:00.19" data-timestamp="780.19">--one of the largest companies in the world.

If there's any company less associated with habitual work-time pot use, it has to Procter &amp; Gamble.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard</h4><p begin="00:13:12.45" data-timestamp="792.45">Right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:13:13.27" data-timestamp="793.27">So, when you were making these presentations, you don't think that they knew that you were high at the time? That you'd stopped in at an alley on the way over and smoked a joint?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard</h4><p begin="00:13:23.58" data-timestamp="803.58">No. I was putting something over on the straight world.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:13:29.60" data-timestamp="809.6">Like, I'm not really part of your world. I'm just visiting here for a little bit.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard</h4><p begin="00:13:33.95" data-timestamp="813.95">I think that was something that was very, very much a part of being stoned. Here I was, this guy in a business suit, tucking down a back alley and smoking a joint.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:13:50.87" data-timestamp="830.87">Another question I had for my dad, were there people for whom his drug use was not a secret? Other members of the Society of Secret Pot Smokers that he'd duck into that alley with? Was he regularly sharing joints with-- I don't know-- the Kinko's guy while they both waited on a large print order?</p><p begin="00:14:06.18" data-timestamp="846.18">I could see a camaraderie developing between secret pot smokers, just like cigarette smokers at an office will go out and take smoke breaks together. But my dad says that, for him at least, it wasn't like that. Sure, he knew of other people at the agency who smoked pot. And yes, if you must know, they were mostly in the art department. But he mainly kept to himself.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard</h4><p begin="00:14:24.11" data-timestamp="864.11">You increasing live in a secret world that you can't reveal to the people who don't share that world. And there are an increasingly limited number of people who share the world-- the more you use, the deeper you get into it, to the point where you're all alone in it. And you have to keep it a secret from everybody else. And you do really stupid things to keep it a secret, really stupid.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:14:56.08" data-timestamp="896.08">What are you thinking of when you said "really stupid"?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard</h4><p begin="00:14:59.52" data-timestamp="899.52">Well, I remember one time, I went down, I'd stopped in Eton Park on the way back to the office. And I got out of the car. And I got stoned. I smoked a joint. And I came back, and I realized that I'd locked my keys in the car. And I couldn't-- you know, I was stoned. My judgment was shot. I didn't know what to do.</p><p begin="00:15:29.97" data-timestamp="929.97">So I went around. And I found a big rock. And I broke the little window in the rear. And I reached in and unlocked the door. And then, the back of the seat was full of glass. And I had to go down to Ace Auto Glass and had the glass replaced. And then, finally, I got to the office an hour and a half late for the meeting. And I made up some excuse. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:16:03.43" data-timestamp="963.43">This image of my dad in his suit, early morning, rooting around in the underbrush for a rock to throw through his own car window, I found it so shocking. It is one solution to the problem at hand. But it's hard to imagine a person who wasn't high, weighing all the options and deciding, you know the think I need to do right now at 8:00 AM on a work day? Smash in my own car window.</p><p begin="00:16:24.84" data-timestamp="984.84">And I know, as rock bottom stories go, this is nothing special. In general, my dad's addiction story barely registers on the family dysfunction scale. But his marijuana use was starting to fray the edges of his life. He and his business partner, Dale, were having regular fights over my dad's inability to show up to meetings on time, or fill out his time sheets, or just get things done when he said he would.</p><p begin="00:16:46.70" data-timestamp="1006.7">At a certain point, my dad sold his stake in the business for a nice chunk of money. But then, he lost most of it on a string of failed business ventures. I remember my dad trying to explain a couple of them to me at the time. I was just out of college at this point. And I never really understood what the products actually were or how they were going to make any money.</p><p begin="00:17:03.69" data-timestamp="1023.69">Only in retrospect did I realize, after the cancer and the secret came out, those business ideas, they made a lot more sense if you were stoned. All told, in today's dollars, my dad probably lost somewhere north of half a million. And this brings me to the most basic question I had for my dad, the question that lay underneath all the other ones.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:17:23.59" data-timestamp="1043.59">Why do you think you were getting high every day at work?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard</h4><p begin="00:17:29.91" data-timestamp="1049.91">Uh, I think that I was getting high because I didn't really feel that marketing was a worthwhile thing to do.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:17:47.26" data-timestamp="1067.26">This is part of it for sure. Getting high allowed my dad to retreat from this reality that he didn't want to face, that he wasn't a hippie anymore but, in fact, a guy in a suit with a job in advertising.</p><p begin="00:17:59.34" data-timestamp="1079.34">But that answer, it didn't feel like the full truth to me. Because he wasn't just running from reality at work. He was running from it at home as well.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:18:07.49" data-timestamp="1087.49">The one time in particular I remember was we were on vacation out in California. It was one of the times we went to California. We did a big road trip across the country. It was sort of crazy.</p><p begin="00:18:16.85" data-timestamp="1096.85">And we'd found some unbelievably beautiful little swimming hole in northern California. And we'd set up a tent. And the weather was perfect. And we were all getting out. We'd put on our swimsuits. And we were all getting ready to get in. And we'd just been visiting your friends Gene and Jan in San Francisco. And they'd given you some--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard</h4><p begin="00:18:38.49" data-timestamp="1118.49">[LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:18:40.49" data-timestamp="1120.49">They'd given you some Berkeley gold, as they called it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard</h4><p begin="00:18:42.87" data-timestamp="1122.87">Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:18:43.93" data-timestamp="1123.93">And I remember you rolling a joint and saying something like, but first, it's time for little Berkeley gold, or something like that. And I remember being really upset. And part of, I think, the reason that I was so upset is I remember thinking, what in the world? What more could you want?</p><p begin="00:19:07.26" data-timestamp="1147.26">And there's sort of a feeling of, are we not enough? It seemed like, almost even at that time in your life, you were almost sort of running from something even in that moment or wanting to change the reality a little bit in that moment. Is it--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard</h4><p begin="00:19:29.61" data-timestamp="1169.61">I think I probably was.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:19:31.06" data-timestamp="1171.06">What were you--? What didn't you have?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard</h4><p begin="00:19:33.87" data-timestamp="1173.87">I don't know.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:19:34.78" data-timestamp="1174.78">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard</h4><p begin="00:19:35.09" data-timestamp="1175.09">I don't know what it was. I had a perfect life.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:19:41.51" data-timestamp="1181.51">I guess that's where I feel like I go back to it was feeling. Like, I find when I've used pot, the thing that it takes away is it takes away feeling.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard</h4><p begin="00:19:57.66" data-timestamp="1197.66">Yep.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:19:57.96" data-timestamp="1197.96">Feelings become less intense. And I feel like, for whatever reason, the feelings of oh my god, this is so perfect. I love my family so much. Or, oh my god, this should be so perfect, but I'm pissed off at my wife. Or, I'm let down by my children, or whatever it is that you were feeling. I sort of feel like that's the thing that links all of the pot use. Is that true? Or is that just my theory?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard</h4><p begin="00:20:32.80" data-timestamp="1232.8">Yeah, I think it's true. It's part of what you're running away from. The most important thing is that you're running away from something. You're running away from looking at the world as it really is. You push all of that direct experience of reality away. It's not a good way to live. It's just not a good way to live.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:21:12.70" data-timestamp="1272.7">Oddly, for my dad, it wasn't just the happy moments he regretted checking out for, but the sad ones as well. For example, when his mother died of cancer. My aunt had been telling my dad that their mother's condition was getting worse, worse than their mother was letting on.</p><p begin="00:21:28.51" data-timestamp="1288.51">If my dad hadn't been high, he says, he wouldn't have ignored what my aunt was telling him. He would have spent more time with his mother, engaged more with her doctors.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard</h4><p begin="00:21:36.45" data-timestamp="1296.45">I probably would have been in Cleveland with her when she had the operation that ended in her death.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:21:42.80" data-timestamp="1302.8">Oh, I didn't know that she died during operation.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard</h4><p begin="00:21:46.16" data-timestamp="1306.16">Yes. She had bone cancer. And they were trying to break a connection to the pituitary gland or something like that that would reduce the pain. And she wound up hemorrhaging and died.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:22:11.80" data-timestamp="1331.8">Mm. And you thought about going with her when she did that and you decided not to?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard</h4><p begin="00:22:20.67" data-timestamp="1340.67">If it were to happen today, there's no question that I would have driven her up to Cleveland. That would've been the most natural thing in the world to do.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:22:34.37" data-timestamp="1354.37">Instead, he says, he got high, pushed the feelings aside, and avoided the whole thing, which makes this last story I'll tell all the more amazing. Just last month, my 80-year-old Uncle Paul, my mom's brother, fell ill suddenly and ended up in the hospital, near death, with a breathing tube down his throat.</p><p begin="00:22:51.98" data-timestamp="1371.98">My parents got the call and were on a plane down to Florida where he lived the very next day. My uncle was a recluse. Except for occasional phone calls to his brothers and sisters, he interacted with almost no one. It was my parents and a neighbor that Paul barely knew confronting the sad end to his lonely life, Medicaid applications, power of attorney, hospice, finally, cremation.</p><p begin="00:23:12.26" data-timestamp="1392.26">And while my parents were down there going about all that, my dad did something that was, on the one hand, utterly ordinary, but that I found remarkable. He emailed us with regular, almost daily, updates, giving the details on Paul's changing condition, going through next steps. The emails were direct and honest, filled with love for Paul and sadness about his decline.</p><p begin="00:23:34.94" data-timestamp="1414.94">And I would sit there and read them. And they felt miraculous. A daily email on a tough, hard-to-face topic from my dad, something he never could have done organizationally or emotionally when he was high.</p><p begin="00:23:51.30" data-timestamp="1431.3">Like I said, as these stories go, ours wasn't that bad. My dad was a good dad. He read to us every night, took us on long hikes in search of snakes and salamanders to keep as pets. But his drug use did leave at least one lasting effect on me. I can't hear any story about a seemingly functional pot-head with anything but a skeptical ear.</p><p begin="00:24:11.95" data-timestamp="1451.95">From magazine features about rappers who are constantly high but still put out platinum records to casual asides about this friend I know who smokes weed all day but is a great husband and father, some part of me just can't buy it, can't help but think, there's more to that story. There's always something being run from. And there's always at least one person wondering, is that something me?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:24:43.29" data-timestamp="1483.29">Alex Blumberg is one of the producers of our show.

We choose a theme, bring you different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's program, "I Was So High," stories about doing drugs, the people who do lots of drugs, and the rest of us who maybe do not do as many drugs.</p><p begin="00:25:21.33" data-timestamp="1521.33">We have arrived at Act Two of our program-- Act Two, You Were So High.

And we asked you to send in your drug stories on our blog and Facebook and Twitter. You sent in 2,600.

I don't smoke it that much, because I don't get high smoking weed. It doesn't affect me. It doesn't affect me. I've only once gotten high from pot. And that was one time I ate a pot brownie.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Audience</h4><p begin="00:32:40.32" data-timestamp="1960.32">Ooh.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Wyatt Cenac</h4><p begin="00:32:41.31" data-timestamp="1961.31">Yeah, that's right. That's the right response. [LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:32:44.60" data-timestamp="1964.6">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:32:46.02" data-timestamp="1966.02">I ate a pot brownie. I was about eight years ago. I was living in California at the time. And it was Memorial Day weekend. And I was with three of my friends. And we decided to go to a Dodgers game. And so, it was me, my friend Ben, my friend Steve, and Steve's brother, Sweet Dave.</p><p begin="00:33:03.09" data-timestamp="1983.09">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:33:05.21" data-timestamp="1985.21">You could try to call him Dave if you want to. But he won't answer to anything but Sweet Dave. Like, if a tiger was about to attack and you were like, Dave, look out!

We're in the parking lot at Dodger Stadium. We're tailgating. And one of my friends is like, hey, I got some pot brownies. And I'm going to let you guess which friend of mine said that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:33:32.73" data-timestamp="2012.73">Sweet Dave?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Wyatt Cenac</h4><p begin="00:33:34.34" data-timestamp="2014.34">Wrong.

And it seems like, oh yeah, four and four. Here's a little twist. At this point in my life, at 30 years old, I had never had pot before. And also at that point in my life, I had no job. I was living off my credit cards, which my credit cards didn't really appreciate.</p><p begin="00:34:05.56" data-timestamp="2045.56">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:34:06.96" data-timestamp="2046.96">I was about to get evicted. And I was five months behind on my car note. And so I looked at my friends. And I was like, eh, I don't really have anything to live for. Let's go. And I ate the brownie. And then, we went into the game. And we sat down. And we're all sitting in Dodger Stadium.</p><p begin="00:34:22.73" data-timestamp="2062.73">And I can see that it's starting to hit my friends. Like, they're all starting to look around and get a little giggly. And it's hitting them. And my friend Ben looks at me. And he's like, you feel it yet? And I was like, nah. But I do got to take a piss.</p><p begin="00:34:35.54" data-timestamp="2075.54">So I get up and I go to the bathroom. And I come back. And Steve is in it hard. I can see. He's just sitting straight up. And his arms are crossed. And he's just watching the field, not the game, the field.</p><p begin="00:34:49.22" data-timestamp="2089.22">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:34:51.45" data-timestamp="2091.45">And Ben looks at me.

I couldn't say anything. And I could hear my friend Laura on the other end. And she's saying hello.</p><p begin="00:35:14.08" data-timestamp="2114.08">Then, I'm trying so hard. I'm just like, say something. Just talk. Talk damn it! And finally, I am like, (UNUSUAL ACCENT) I am so [BLEEP] high.

And I have never done that voice before in my life. I don't know where that voice came from. But I heard myself use that voice. And in my mind, I went, oh [BLEEP]. I just gave myself Down Syndrome.</p><p begin="00:35:46.64" data-timestamp="2146.64">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:35:52.08" data-timestamp="2152.08">(NORMAL VOICE) Now let me just say, I know what Down Syndrome is. I know that Down Syndrome is something that you're born with when you are born with an extra chromosome. I know all that information. I knew that information then. But something about eating this brownie made me think that somehow I had grown an extra chromosome and I now had adult-onset Down Syndrome.</p><p begin="00:36:14.79" data-timestamp="2174.79">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:36:19.27" data-timestamp="2179.27">And for people who have Down Syndrome, it's something they grow up with. And they grow up and they have healthy and happy lives.

I'm just like, I'm going to have to explain this to people. And I start panicking. And I just start freaking out, freaking out to the point where I start weeping in the middle of Dodger Stadium.</p><p begin="00:36:46.49" data-timestamp="2206.49">And then, I start laughing. And then, I start weeping again. And then, a bunch of cops start walking towards me. And something in my brain just clicks on. It's like, Wyatt, you have to keep it together right now. I was like, (UNUSUAL ACCENT) yes. Keep it together.</p><p begin="00:37:07.66" data-timestamp="2227.66">(NORMAL VOICE) Yeah, Wyatt, there are cops right there. They cannot know you are high. (UNUSUAL ACCENT) No, they cannot know I am high. (NORMAL VOICE) And now, my internal monologue has become my external monologue. And I start pointing at the cops.</p><p begin="00:37:24.95" data-timestamp="2244.95">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:37:25.72" data-timestamp="2245.72">And I'm like, (UNUSUAL ACCENT) you cannot know I am high. I have to fool  you. I am fooling you.</p><p begin="00:37:33.86" data-timestamp="2253.86">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:37:36.62" data-timestamp="2256.62">(NORMAL VOICE) We thought maybe it's time we should leave Dodger Stadium. I'm not sure exactly how far into the game we were. I know it was past the first inning. We might not have made it to the third inning.</p><p begin="00:37:47.66" data-timestamp="2267.66">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:37:49.39" data-timestamp="2269.39">But we leave. And we get back to Steve's place. Ben immediately leaves, goes home, sees his roommate who's like, hey, what's up?

  <h3>Act Four: Straight Man</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:38:36.61" data-timestamp="2316.61">Act Four, Straight Man. So, Marc Maron is a comedian who, for a long time, very aggressively did smoke pot, every day. He also did coke, and LSD, and mushrooms. He says that, for a while, he did so many drugs that he was hearing voices.</p><p begin="00:38:50.89" data-timestamp="2330.89">He first tried to get sober in 1988. He has now been continuously sober for over 15 years. He's best known these days for his podcast, <i>WTF,</i> which is basically the <i>New</i> <i>York</i> <i>Times</i> of comedy podcasts. It's like the comedy podcast of record. Every comedian goes on to talk to Marc. He also has a TV series on IFC.</p><p begin="00:39:07.94" data-timestamp="2347.94">We reached out to him because he's been on both sides of the line, right? He's been a daily drug user. And he has been sober. And we thought that he would just have some perspective on what each side thinks of the other.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:39:18.78" data-timestamp="2358.78">So we're doing this episode of our show this week with a lot of drug stories. And you seemed like the perfect person to ask this question of, because I know that you're someone who loves a funny story when you hear it.</p><p begin="00:39:29.12" data-timestamp="2369.12">But you're also somebody who has seen what addiction can do to people. So, one of the questions I wanted to ask you is, given how drugs kill people and how dangerous they are, is it OK to laugh at these stories?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marc Maron</h4><p begin="00:39:42.63" data-timestamp="2382.63">Of course it is.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:39:44.24" data-timestamp="2384.24">Why?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marc Maron</h4><p begin="00:39:47.05" data-timestamp="2387.05">Because they're funny. Most drug stories are stories about people who are out of control in some way and get into horrendously risky or embarrassing situations. And--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:40:04.11" data-timestamp="2404.11">I know. But isn't it glorifying a thing that shouldn't be glorified? You know what I mean? Have people told you stories that you enjoyed-- like even on your podcast-- have people told you stories that are funny stories, but there's a little part of you that's in recovery that cringes a little bit?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marc Maron</h4><p begin="00:40:20.01" data-timestamp="2420.01">Oh, yeah. But I think that the other side of glorification is-- I would say that it's as much of a red flag or a warning sign as it is a glorification. You're going to laugh on either side of that.</p><p begin="00:40:32.77" data-timestamp="2432.77">It's like, oh my god! That guy almost died. I am so glad that I do not live that life. But you can also see that as, like, there is a strange courage to it. And I think that mythology is wearing away.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:40:49.17" data-timestamp="2449.17">That mythology being?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marc Maron</h4><p begin="00:40:50.74" data-timestamp="2450.74">That there is a courage to the drug adventurer.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:40:53.77" data-timestamp="2453.77">Right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marc Maron</h4><p begin="00:40:55.47" data-timestamp="2455.47">I think that was something that the '60s was sort of built on. And I think that it was something that creativity and art was sort of built on, that there was struggle, and torment, and alcohol, and drugs, that people wrestled this amazing--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:41:10.79" data-timestamp="2470.79">And that there was something to learn from drugs.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marc Maron</h4><p begin="00:41:13.71" data-timestamp="2473.71">I do think there's something to learn.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:41:15.61" data-timestamp="2475.61">You do?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marc Maron</h4><p begin="00:41:16.77" data-timestamp="2476.77">Well, yeah, I did that big story on my '95 HBO half hour about going to a Jerry Garcia concert and being on mushrooms by myself. And I will stand by that story as being the primary thing that you learn on drugs.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:41:33.41" data-timestamp="2493.41">Wait, I don't know this story, I'm sorry to say. What happens? Not to make you do an entire bit here but, essentially, what happens?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marc Maron</h4><p begin="00:41:41.36" data-timestamp="2501.36">Well, what happens is I'm going to see Jerry Garcia with my roommates. It was at the Orpheum, I believe, in Boston. And I'm in college. And I'd gotten my tickets from these two girls I didn't know that well. One of them was in my class.</p><p begin="00:41:59.25" data-timestamp="2519.25">And my roommates had their tickets. And we're going to the concert. And we just eat a big bag of mushrooms. And we get to the concert. And they're going to sit somewhere else.</p><p begin="00:42:08.39" data-timestamp="2528.39">So I'm all alone with these strange girls. And I'm beginning to trip on mushrooms. And it's not good. You just feel that weird kind of amp.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:18.84" data-timestamp="2538.84">Mm-hmm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marc Maron</h4><p begin="00:42:19.52" data-timestamp="2539.52">You start getting that surge where you begin to trip on hallucinogens. And your head feels like it's about to pop off. And your perception is starting to change. And I'm starting to freak out a little bit. Because I don't know who I'm with.</p><p begin="00:42:34.38" data-timestamp="2554.38">My roommates are down somewhere else, sitting there. And I'm looking at these girls. And their faces are a little too large now. And everything's getting a little sweaty. And I'm starting to panic. And I'm thinking, like, OK. I could always go to the emergency room if I freak out. I could just go to the emergency room.</p><p begin="00:42:50.64" data-timestamp="2570.64">And I think that the women I'm sitting with, who don't really know me, are sensing that I'm starting to panic. And they're like, do you want some gum? And I'm like, oh god, that would be so good. Gum would just be the right thing right now, like everything is when you're tripping.</p><p begin="00:43:03.78" data-timestamp="2583.78">Oh, of course, gum! And they give me a piece of gum. And it's Freshen-Up. And I didn't really register it until I put it in my mouth. So this gum explodes. And I think--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:12.89" data-timestamp="2592.89">[LAUGHS] The gum with the squirty inside, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marc Maron</h4><p begin="00:43:15.45" data-timestamp="2595.45">Yeah, right. And I think I'm bleeding. And I spit the gum out. And I'm just panicking. It's just awful. And then, the lights go down.</p><p begin="00:43:27.31" data-timestamp="2607.31">And then, Jerry comes out. And he looks fat. And I'm hyper-sensitive on the mushrooms. And I think I'm reading things. And I'm feeling things. I'm an empath. And I realize Jerry's in trouble. He's overweight.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:39.58" data-timestamp="2619.58">[LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marc Maron</h4><p begin="00:43:40.66" data-timestamp="2620.66">His voice doesn't sound good. So now, I'm freaking out on Jerry, who is really supposed to be the ultimate guide through this experience, you know?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:49.07" data-timestamp="2629.07">Right, like calmest calm-inducing person.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marc Maron</h4><p begin="00:43:52.26" data-timestamp="2632.26">Right. He's the mythological Drug Buddha. And if I'm getting a bad vibe from Jerry, I got nowhere to go. And then, I notice there's one of those guys sitting in front of me who has clearly been to too many Dead shows and done so much acid that he operates at a different frequency than other people. He's kind of jerky. And he's got a very graceful but odd way of just holding his body. You see them at these type of events. [LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:44:22.65" data-timestamp="2662.65">And I'm thinking to myself, he'll help me out. This guy will throw me a line. So I'm trying to socialize with this guy. And I tap him on the shoulder. And I go, hey, you know, pretty soon one day, Jerry's going to come out and him and his guitar are just going to be fused. They're going to be, like, one thing.</p><p begin="00:44:39.30" data-timestamp="2679.3">And this guy just cocks around with such precise hallucinogenic focus. And he looks me right in the eye. And he goes, (UNUSUAL ACCENT) just hang on, man! Just hang on.</p><p begin="00:44:48.67" data-timestamp="2688.67">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:44:52.51" data-timestamp="2692.51">And he turns around. And I'm like, that's it. I will do that. I will hang on.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:44:59.33" data-timestamp="2699.33">Wait, and is that the insight one can have on drugs? Is just hang on?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marc Maron</h4><p begin="00:45:03.66" data-timestamp="2703.66">Yeah, a lot of times, if you just hang on, it'll pass.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:45:09.14" data-timestamp="2709.14">When you were smoking every day, did you feel superior to people who weren't doing drugs?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marc Maron</h4><p begin="00:45:17.81" data-timestamp="2717.81">I felt like I had a secret. I don't know of that's superior. But I felt like, oh man, I'm so glad I'm seeing this like I'm seeing it. So I guess there is a slight superiority in that, that I'm not on this hamster wheel, man. You know, I'm just walking down the street. And I'm really seeing what the sunlight is doing.</p><p begin="00:45:38.65" data-timestamp="2738.65">It's sort of double-edged though. Because the squares are the people that try to function in the world-- like, weird moment back when I was doing a lot of coke. And I think it speaks to your point. I had this woman that I dated in college. She came out to visit me in LA.</p><p begin="00:45:55.71" data-timestamp="2755.71">And I was living at this creepy old mansion behind The Comedy Store that Mitzi Shore owned. And we were just up there at all hours, doing drugs, and staying up all night, and playing guitar, and talking about whatever for hours. So this woman comes to visit me. And it's like 3:00 in the morning. And she's just a regular girl who works for-- now, she works in health administration.</p><p begin="00:46:21.58" data-timestamp="2781.58">But so, she comes out to visit me. And we're up in the middle of the night. And I'm just reveling in it, like, this is amazing, man! Nobody lives like this! We're living! And then, she leaves completely discombobulated and visibly upset for things I couldn't quite understand.</p><p begin="00:46:42.05" data-timestamp="2802.05">And she sends me a handwritten letter, because that's what we did then, basically explaining to me-- she's like, you know when you stood up and just celebrated the fact that nobody lives like we do?

  <h3>Act Five: DEA Agent Takes a Hit</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:57.51" data-timestamp="2997.51">Act Five, "DEA Agent Takes a Hit." So this is a moment when everything seems in flux in how our country sees and deals with drugs, particularly marijuana. Case in point, the past few months in Congress, the House Government Oversight Committee has been holding a series of hearings called "Mixed Signals, the Administration's Stance on Marijuana."</p><p begin="00:50:17.31" data-timestamp="3017.31">These are the Committee's first hearings on pot in a decade. And they're holding them now, in large part, because so many states-- 20 states plus Washington, DC-- now allow some form of legal marijuana, which of course is in direct conflict with federal drug law. And one of the interesting things about these hearings is that two congressmen who think that our marijuana policies are totally out of whack, they think that pot should not be illegal under federal law-- have been using these hearings as an opportunity to, basically, lay into narcs, just to chew them out.</p><p begin="00:50:47.10" data-timestamp="3047.1">It's kind of incredible. You almost never hear people on two sides of this issue talk to each other this directly, this fiercely, in public. One side, OK, sees pot smoking as normal, everyday, no biggie. What's the fuss? The other side sees the everyday-ness of pot as the problem, as a menace. Brian Reed tells about one of these congressional face-offs.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:51:10.82" data-timestamp="3070.82">I'm going to play you my favorite tape from these hearings. It's of one of the congressmen, Steve Cohen from Memphis in an Oversight Committee hearing on March 4. Cohen isn't even on the Oversight Committee, by the way.</p><p begin="00:51:21.23" data-timestamp="3081.23">He asked for special permission to take part in the hearing, because he had some things he wanted to say to the witness, Thomas Harrigan. Harrigan is second in charge of the agency tasked with enforcing federal drug laws, the DEA. The two men do not see eye-to-eye.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Cohen</h4><p begin="00:51:35.62" data-timestamp="3095.62">Mr. Harrigan, you've been in this business now for close to 30 years? 1987, you started with the DEA. How have your views changed on marijuana in those 30 years?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Harrigan</h4><p begin="00:51:48.63" data-timestamp="3108.63">To be quite honest with you, sir, very little.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Cohen</h4><p begin="00:51:50.52" data-timestamp="3110.52">I was afraid of that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Harrigan</h4><p begin="00:51:52.30" data-timestamp="3112.3">I see the devastation--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Cohen</h4><p begin="00:51:54.12" data-timestamp="3114.12">That's enough. The fact that it's changed very little says a lot about--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Harrigan</h4><p begin="00:51:56.62" data-timestamp="3116.62">Do you want me to respond to your question, sir?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Cohen</h4><p begin="00:51:58.63" data-timestamp="3118.63">No, sir.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Harrigan</h4><p begin="00:51:58.96" data-timestamp="3118.96">Because I would be happy to.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Cohen</h4><p begin="00:51:59.68" data-timestamp="3119.68">I know you would. We have limited time. The fact that it's changed very little shows that you haven't kept up with society. You haven't kept up with science. And it's part of the problem--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Harrigan</h4><p begin="00:52:07.40" data-timestamp="3127.4">Science and medical I do keep up, sir.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Cohen</h4><p begin="00:52:09.28" data-timestamp="3129.28">All right. You mentioned in your statement that, quote, "It insults our common values." I want you to read me what you said.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Harrigan</h4><p begin="00:52:26.98" data-timestamp="3146.98">Yes, sir. I believe this is the section you're referring to. "We also know that marijuana destroys lives and families, undermines our economy, and insults our common values."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Cohen</h4><p begin="00:52:38.85" data-timestamp="3158.85">What are the common values it insults?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Harrigan</h4><p begin="00:52:41.01" data-timestamp="3161.01">For me, sir?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Cohen</h4><p begin="00:52:41.97" data-timestamp="3161.97">No, for--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Harrigan</h4><p begin="00:52:43.13" data-timestamp="3163.13">I will tell you. I will tell you if you let me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Cohen</h4><p begin="00:52:45.66" data-timestamp="3165.66">You said, we know. You're speaking as clairvoyant voice of America. What are our common values?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Harrigan</h4><p begin="00:52:52.03" data-timestamp="3172.03">Well, I would venture to guess all of law enforcement, just about every single parent out there as well.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Cohen</h4><p begin="00:52:59.84" data-timestamp="3179.84">Every single parent?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Harrigan</h4><p begin="00:53:00.80" data-timestamp="3180.8">Yes, every single parent. It's based on, again, medical, sir, and scientific fact, not public opinion. OK, I am not the medical expert, as I said before. Everything that I do is based on my 30 plus years of law enforcement.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Cohen</h4><p begin="00:53:14.69" data-timestamp="3194.69">Let me stop you for a minute. You said, it insults our common values. What is the value it insults?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Harrigan</h4><p begin="00:53:22.15" data-timestamp="3202.15">What is the value it insults?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Cohen</h4><p begin="00:53:23.92" data-timestamp="3203.92">Yeah, you said, this--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Harrigan</h4><p begin="00:53:25.10" data-timestamp="3205.1">Do we have all--? I could easily go on and on.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Cohen</h4><p begin="00:53:28.51" data-timestamp="3208.51">You haven't started yet.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Harrigan</h4><p begin="00:53:29.96" data-timestamp="3209.96">Well, you continue to interrupt me. I would be happy to address your question.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Cohen</h4><p begin="00:53:35.22" data-timestamp="3215.22">Answer my question, sir.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Harrigan</h4><p begin="00:53:36.27" data-timestamp="3216.27">Yes, you know what? From a bare minimum, as a parent, as a former educator, as a law enforcement official for all these years, I have seen the devastation that marijuana has caused not only on individuals, on families and communities.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Cohen</h4><p begin="00:53:58.42" data-timestamp="3238.42">What's our common value, though? You still haven't stated the common value. And the fact is 55% of Americans are in favor of decriminalization or legalization. I got to imagine that some of them are parents.</p><p begin="00:54:07.97" data-timestamp="3247.97">Your statement that all parents are against this is ludicrous. Want do you think? People that are in favor of decriminalization or a change in policy--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Harrigan</h4><p begin="00:54:14.12" data-timestamp="3254.12">I didn't say, all.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Cohen</h4><p begin="00:54:14.98" data-timestamp="3254.98">--don't procreate?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Harrigan</h4><p begin="00:54:15.72" data-timestamp="3255.72">I said, most parents--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Cohen</h4><p begin="00:54:17.45" data-timestamp="3257.45">You said, all.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Harrigan</h4><p begin="00:54:17.97" data-timestamp="3257.97">--would be opposed to this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Cohen</h4><p begin="00:54:19.75" data-timestamp="3259.75">And most is wrong too, 55% of America!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Harrigan</h4><p begin="00:54:22.94" data-timestamp="3262.94">Are they all parents?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Cohen</h4><p begin="00:54:24.88" data-timestamp="3264.88">I don't think that the polls went into that. But I suspect a whole bunch of them were. It's not--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:54:29.31" data-timestamp="3269.31">This went on for more than five minutes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Cohen</h4><p begin="00:54:31.27" data-timestamp="3271.27">Let's get beyond Richard Nixon.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:54:33.15" data-timestamp="3273.15">I call the DEA to see if Thomas Harrigan wanted to come on the radio and have a chance to actually respond, since Cohen barely let him get a word in edgewise. But the DEA spokesperson said Harrigan was busy preparing for another hearing this week, so he couldn't do it.</p><p begin="00:54:46.86" data-timestamp="3286.86">As for Congressman Cohen, one of his biggest beefs with the country's drug policy is the fact that marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 drug. That means, in the eyes of the federal government , marijuana has a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use.</p><p begin="00:55:01.29" data-timestamp="3301.29">Heroin, LSD, peyote, these are all Schedule 1. Cocaine and meth, on the other hand, are Schedule 2, a less serious designation. So under federal law, marijuana is considered the most dangerous type of drug, more dangerous than cocaine and meth. In Cohen's words, that's poppycock. He says, marijuana is the least dangerous of these drugs and most people know it including, apparently, President Obama.</p><p begin="00:55:29.41" data-timestamp="3329.41">In a <i>New</i> <i>Yorker</i> profile earlier this year, Obama said, quote, "As has been well-documented, I smoked pot as a kid. And I view it as a bad habit and a vice, not very different from the cigarettes that I smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life. I don't think it is more dangerous than alcohol."</p><p begin="00:55:47.61" data-timestamp="3347.61">In fact, Obama said, quote, "In terms of its impact on the individual consumer, he believes pot is less dangerous than alcohol," which just shows how confused we are as a country right now when it comes to what we're supposed to be doing about marijuana. You've got the president of the United States saying something like that about pot while, at the same time, he's the boss of an entire bureaucracy with thousands of people whose job is to think the opposite.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:15.06" data-timestamp="3375.06">Brian Reed is one of the producers of our show.</p></div>  </div>
