  <h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:11.23" data-timestamp="11.23"> David, so, what problem was this supposed to solve?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:00:15.32" data-timestamp="15.32"> The teachers were trying to get the kids to stop tattling.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:18.51" data-timestamp="18.51"> And why was that so important?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:00:20.72" data-timestamp="20.72"> Because it's a pre-K classroom, and it's constant there.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:24.17" data-timestamp="24.17"> Right. I should say, by the way, that you are David Kestenbaum. You are one of our producers, our managing editor right now. And this classroom is your kid's classroom, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:00:33.78" data-timestamp="33.78"> Yeah. Both of them went there.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:35.10" data-timestamp="35.1"> I still don't get-- it seems like kids tattling on each other is just a fact of pre-K.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:00:39.66" data-timestamp="39.66"> It is, but you've got 20-something kids. I mean, you know, it's hard being one parent with two kids doing it. Imagine you're in a classroom with, like, 20 kids. And if they bring it to you as a teacher, all these little injustices, you've got to get involved in all these cases, you know?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:52.76" data-timestamp="52.76"> Right. And it's just a time suck.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:00:54.03" data-timestamp="54.03"> Yeah, it's just a time suck. And so one of the teachers had this great idea. She took a tissue box, hung it on the wall, and then took this plastic phone receiver and hung it in it and said something like, that's the tattle-phone. Tell it to the phone. And I thought it was just brilliant.</p><p begin="00:01:15.65" data-timestamp="75.65">And I just want to say, this is a place that loves kids. I would go to pick up my son Max, and I would have to wait because he would want to hug every single teacher. And I would go to get Auggie, our older kid, and he would be like, I need five minutes, I'm in the middle of something. Like--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:28.35" data-timestamp="88.35"> They just want to stay longer.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:01:30.00" data-timestamp="90"> I mean, I get choked up thinking about this place. And I love the idea of the tattle-phone, just as a vessel for all the little injustices that go on every day. And I wanted to hear what was said into it-- like, these little three year olds, four year olds talking into this plastic phone.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:42.87" data-timestamp="102.87"> OK. And I should say, this is the part of the story I know very well what happens next.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:01:46.44" data-timestamp="106.44"> We asked if we could put a phone in the classroom that would record the tattles. The daycare was fine with that. I reached out to the parents. I didn't know how they were going to feel about us recording their kids at, like, the worst moment of the day. But every single one of them said yes. Some of them said please, yes, do this. So we got a phone.</p><p begin="00:02:04.23" data-timestamp="124.23">It was this chunky red phone, kind of like 1980s style, we had it set up to record. And we needed an outgoing message for it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:11.91" data-timestamp="131.91"> And that is where I stepped in.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:13.47" data-timestamp="133.47"> Hey there, you've reached the tattle phone. OK, tell me what happened after the beep. Tell me the whole story.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:21.45" data-timestamp="141.45"> I really hope to make some inroads in that four-year-old market. I really hope that helps our ratings. So what we're going to do now, David, is that you're going to explain what you heard on those recordings on the tattle-phone. And when you're done, I'm going to come back, and I'll explain what today's show is about.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:02:37.04" data-timestamp="157.04"> OK. So I brought the phone into class, and I set it up. And the kids started to use it immediately and with great enthusiasm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kid 1</h4><p begin="00:02:44.11" data-timestamp="164.11"> Eli told me a lie.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kid 2</h4><p begin="00:02:48.25" data-timestamp="168.25"> Seamus wasn't sharing with me, and I don't like it, and I'm very upset.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kid 3</h4><p begin="00:02:55.00" data-timestamp="175"> Nathan farted in my face, and I said, yuck, Nathan.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:03:00.96" data-timestamp="180.96"> Catch that one? Nathan farted in my face, and I said, yuck, Nathan. But the real crime?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kid 3</h4><p begin="00:03:06.55" data-timestamp="186.55"> And he didn't say excuse me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:03:09.85" data-timestamp="189.85"> I think there was enormous excitement just having a phone in the class. It was larger than they'd probably ever seen in their lives-- bright red with buttons on it. It was an old touch-tone phone. Everyone wanted to use it, even if they didn't have a tattle. Kids sang a song into it. One tried to order a pizza. Someone said, hi mom, please pick me up early.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kid 4</h4><p begin="00:03:29.25" data-timestamp="209.25"> Hi, Dad. I love you. Bye.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kid 5</h4><p begin="00:03:32.81" data-timestamp="212.81"> Uh, our baby turned into a ducky, and I don't know how it turn into a ducky. And that's why her turned into a ducky and turned back to a baby.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kid 6</h4><p begin="00:03:45.98" data-timestamp="225.98"> Uh-- I'm sorry, I need to hang up on you for one second.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:03:52.22" data-timestamp="232.22"> Several calls later, conscience heavy, that kid calls back.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kid 6</h4><p begin="00:03:56.26" data-timestamp="236.26"> I'm sorry I had to hang up on you. I'm just sorry.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:04:06.21" data-timestamp="246.21"> The tattle-phone was like a magic portal into one preschool classroom in America, which is kind of incredible. Like most parents I'll ask my kids, what happened in school today, and I get nothing. School is like this black box-- you drop them off, pick them up, and you have no idea what happens in between.</p><p begin="00:04:23.50" data-timestamp="263.5">But now I had this phone. It was set up so it sent me the messages as they happened. It was funny listening to them from my desk. The portal into this classroom would open for a second, I get this little report from a kid, hear a little sound of the room, and then it would close-- sometimes for a while. Then the portal would open, I'd hear something, and then silence again. There were never any tattles between 1 and 3 o'clock, because that was nap time. Then they'd start again, these little dramas.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kid 7</h4><p begin="00:04:51.67" data-timestamp="291.67"> Ramon is not listening to my teacher, Mr. Evans, but he's my favorite teacher. And I know-- and I know he's mad at me, but I don't want him to be. So I'm trying my best to listen.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kid 8</h4><p begin="00:05:05.46" data-timestamp="305.46"> My friend Simone said "no" at me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:05:10.33" data-timestamp="310.33"> "My friend Simone." It's always their friends who are bugging them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kid 9</h4><p begin="00:05:13.39" data-timestamp="313.39"> My friend Jack was in my face when I was waiting to go to an area. And that made me really upset.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kid 10</h4><p begin="00:05:22.02" data-timestamp="322.02"> (SINGING) Eli hit me. Eli hit me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kid 11</h4><p begin="00:05:28.66" data-timestamp="328.66"> Um, when I'm playing family with Simone, [INAUDIBLE] keeping me awake while I'm trying to sleep, pretend sleep.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:05:38.68" data-timestamp="338.68"> Can I just say, I'm not sure that one is actionable. You're pretending to sleep and complaining that someone is waking you up? I don't know.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kid 12</h4><p begin="00:05:45.92" data-timestamp="345.92"> People are not sharing the tattle-phone.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:05:51.09" data-timestamp="351.09"> How much of their day is about, like, justice?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kathleen Jones</h4><p begin="00:05:55.20" data-timestamp="355.2"> Oh! I couldn't put a percentage on it. But I could say the majority of the day. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:06:06.48" data-timestamp="366.48"> This is Kathleen Jones, the lead teacher in the class.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kathleen Jones</h4><p begin="00:06:09.71" data-timestamp="369.71"> It is everything-- and rules. They live by rules. They can sit down to play a game, and that whole playtime will be nothing but arguing about the rules. And then there's no playtime left, and they feel good about it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:06:29.94" data-timestamp="389.94"> It's funny. Like, they can't make breakfast for themselves, they can't get dressed, they can barely talk, and they're just full of "that's not fair."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kathleen Jones</h4><p begin="00:06:42.31" data-timestamp="402.31"> But they're dynamos. Every one of them has something that--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:06:47.08" data-timestamp="407.08"> It's awesome.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kathleen Jones</h4><p begin="00:06:48.53" data-timestamp="408.53"> Yes, exactly. It's awesome. They're wonderful.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:06:51.37" data-timestamp="411.37"> There's actual scientific research on this. Kids know when something's unfair, some when they're just 12 months old. My kids weren't even walking then. And I know this is kind of obvious, but so many of the conflicts in this world come down to some version of what's going on in this classroom-- what's fair, how do you divide up something that there's a limited quantity of.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kathleen Jones</h4><p begin="00:07:12.37" data-timestamp="432.37"> You know magnet tiles? We only have one acrylic one that's yellowish gold. That is it. That is the prize in the class. Whoever gets that is like, I'm the king or the queen and ha-ha. The gold-- that's what they call it, the gold.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:07:30.41" data-timestamp="450.41"> I sometimes think that the main usefulness of numbers for my son Max, the whole reason he knows how to count, is score-keeping-- how many of something he has and how many his brother has. It's a weighing of the scales of justice, no matter how tiny.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:07:52.52" data-timestamp="472.52"> So did it work for you? Like, did they stop coming to you with their complaints?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kathleen Jones</h4><p begin="00:07:58.37" data-timestamp="478.37"> Yes, it did. It does work. Yes, that phone holds a lot of power.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:08:03.82" data-timestamp="483.82"> It gave the teachers the break they were looking for. I wanted to see if the kids thought it worked, whether the tattle-phone helped them deal with stuff. So the other weekend I interviewed a bunch of them-- which, I have to say, these were some of the weirder interviews I've done in my professional life. Bob Woodward, I know this isn't right, but I had to pay one interviewee a piece of gum. Another kid, Nicky, insisted on performing magic tricks before granting an interview. I did not have high expectations.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nicky</h4><p begin="00:08:30.08" data-timestamp="510.08"> And then if I do this--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:08:33.99" data-timestamp="513.99"> Wait, that worked really well. Wait, that was actually amazing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nicky</h4><p begin="00:08:38.44" data-timestamp="518.44"> I know.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:08:40.23" data-timestamp="520.23"> That was good.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nicky</h4><p begin="00:08:41.48" data-timestamp="521.48"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:08:42.95" data-timestamp="522.95"> Nicky then refused to talk about the phone at all. But others clearly used it a lot.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gabriel</h4><p begin="00:08:48.48" data-timestamp="528.48"> You have to tell the tattle-phone the whole story, what happened.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:08:54.95" data-timestamp="534.95"> That's Gabriel. This is Deenia.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Deenia</h4><p begin="00:08:57.69" data-timestamp="537.69"> Tell me the whole story. That's all I can remember.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:09:01.74" data-timestamp="541.74"> One girl's parents told me that they were on vacation staying at a hotel, which of course had a landline phone. And their daughter, Simone, said, look, a tattle-phone, as if there was some sort of national tattle-phone network, staffed around the clock by government workers entering everything into a database. My friend's kid Sean, who just turned 5 and who I adore, was the only one who could remember a tattle-worthy event from school in any detail. He whispered it to me. He was clearly kind of excited about this. His friend had kicked him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean</h4><p begin="00:09:31.91" data-timestamp="571.91"> (WHISPERING) He kicked me in the penis.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:09:33.28" data-timestamp="573.28"> (WHISPERING) He what?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean</h4><p begin="00:09:34.66" data-timestamp="574.66"> (WHISPERING) Kicked me in the penis.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:09:36.63" data-timestamp="576.63"> (WHISPERING) He kicked you in the penis? Did you tell the tattle-phone?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean</h4><p begin="00:09:41.39" data-timestamp="581.39"> (WHISPERING) That time, we didn't have any tattle-phone.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:09:44.66" data-timestamp="584.66"> (WHISPERING) Oh, you didn't have the tattle-phone?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean</h4><p begin="00:09:46.74" data-timestamp="586.74"> (WHISPERING) No.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:09:48.40" data-timestamp="588.4"> (WHISPERING) If you had the tattle-phone, would you have told it? Yeah? OK.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:09:53.27" data-timestamp="593.27"> It sounds like it might have been an accident. Sean stood up and acted out the whole thing in slow motion for me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean</h4><p begin="00:09:58.57" data-timestamp="598.57"> Slow motion.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:10:00.26" data-timestamp="600.26"> Like it was a scene from an action movie. His friend was trying to kick the ceiling.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean</h4><p begin="00:10:04.34" data-timestamp="604.34"> So he went like, [ACTION NOISES].</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:10:08.90" data-timestamp="608.9"> They should have a security camera in the classroom.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean</h4><p begin="00:10:12.49" data-timestamp="612.49"> But they don't.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:10:14.15" data-timestamp="614.15"> They don't?

This is Gabriel.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:10:27.33" data-timestamp="627.33"> How did you like having the tattle-phone in the classroom?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gabriel</h4><p begin="00:10:30.18" data-timestamp="630.18"> Good.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:10:33.85" data-timestamp="633.85"> How did it feel after you said something to the tattle-phone?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gabriel</h4><p begin="00:10:37.09" data-timestamp="637.09"> Good.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:10:38.85" data-timestamp="638.85"> How come you felt good?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gabriel</h4><p begin="00:10:41.84" data-timestamp="641.84"> Uh, because-- well, I felt good because I told on the person.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:10:52.43" data-timestamp="652.43"> One girl told me talking to the tattle-phone felt like eating ice cream.</p><p begin="00:11:04.39" data-timestamp="664.39">It's nice to think that just getting something off your chest can solve a problem, that if you just release the fact of the injustice into the world you feel better. And sure, I think that can be true. But we had the phone in class for a month, and I did notice toward the end, we got fewer messages. They came in regularly, but not with the same energy.</p><p begin="00:11:24.04" data-timestamp="684.04">It's possible the novelty was wearing off. I think there's something else going on as well. Before we put the phone in the class, I had it set up in my house, just to make sure it was working. My kids used it a couple of times. And then our younger son Max was complaining that his brother, Auggie, who's a year older, had pinched him.</p><p begin="00:11:42.16" data-timestamp="702.16">Tell it to the tattle-phone, I said. It's not working, he told me. I picked the phone up worried that there was some technical glitch. But it was fine. It's working, Max. No, he said, it's not.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Max</h4><p begin="00:11:54.59" data-timestamp="714.59"> It did not do anything. It doesn't even work to me.

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:17.88" data-timestamp="797.88"> Act One, Hoop Reams. The journalist Michael Lewis, who wrote <i>Moneyball</i> and <i>The</i> <i>Big</i> <i>Short</i> and lots of other books and who contributes to our program now and then, he was looking around at what's going on in America these days. And he noticed that one way you can describe the current moment that we're all living through is that Americans don't trust the refs-- in all walks of life. They don't trust their impartiality.</p><p begin="00:13:42.62" data-timestamp="822.62">I'm talking about police, Supreme Court justices, journalists, the people who regulate the banks and Wall Street and student loans, the people setting medical costs, judges. So many people today feel the system is rigged. I mean, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump both ran on that. So many people feel that the figures of authority, charged with enforcing rules impartially, keeping everybody on a level playing field, that they're failing at their jobs. It's not fair.</p><p begin="00:14:08.51" data-timestamp="848.51">Michael Lewis has not published this reporting that he's been doing on this in a new book. He's decided to make it into a podcast. They launched this week. It's called <i>Against</i> <i>The</i> <i>Rules.</i> And Michael has adapted a version of their very first episode for us to play for you right now. The first episode is about people not trusting the refs in the most literal sense of that. It's about basketball referees. Here's Michael Lewis.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:14:31.04" data-timestamp="871.04"> For me, this story really begins with my 11-year-old son, Walker. He plays on a basketball team run by a Japanese Buddhist temple. My son isn't a Buddhist, though most of the time he could pass for one. He has no conflict with his teachers or his classmates or his Japanese Buddhist teammates.</p><p begin="00:14:48.44" data-timestamp="888.44">I wouldn't say his mind is exactly pure, but usually it's calm. The exception is when he deals with refs. Even in what amounts to a Buddhist basketball game, anytime a ref blows the whistle on him, he throws up his arms in astonishment. Then he jumps up and down with his little fists balled up and his mouth clenched tight, so everyone knows just how much injustice he's suffering. Then he marches off with a scowl. And he doesn't get over it. After a game this season, he gets into the car and starts bitching and moaning all over again.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:15:21.62" data-timestamp="921.62"> How did it make you feel when the ref made those calls?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Walker</h4><p begin="00:15:24.26" data-timestamp="924.26"> Very mad.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:15:26.76" data-timestamp="926.76"> Do you feel any better now?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Walker</h4><p begin="00:15:28.58" data-timestamp="928.58"> No.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:15:30.35" data-timestamp="930.35"> Tell me how it feels.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Walker</h4><p begin="00:15:32.93" data-timestamp="932.93"> It feels like someone keeps poking you in the back of the shoulder and then saying, foul, foul, foul, foul.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:15:41.87" data-timestamp="941.87"> Have you ever fouled out in your career?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Walker</h4><p begin="00:15:43.73" data-timestamp="943.73"> No.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:15:44.66" data-timestamp="944.66"> Did you know that you were at risk of fouling out?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Walker</h4><p begin="00:15:47.06" data-timestamp="947.06"> Yes, but I also knew if I did, it would be unfair because I knew that he was calling the stupidest fouls.

Kevin Durant, their best player, got thrown out of five-- four more than he'd been thrown out of his entire career up to that point. The men who coach the stars aren't much better. Even Steve Kerr, the Warriors' famously decent, civic-minded coach--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Kerr</h4><p begin="00:18:22.29" data-timestamp="1102.29"> I can snap.

You're right. I would never say the things that I do to referees to a person in normal life. It happens two or three times a year. I've been caught on camera, you know, MF-ing a ref. And, you know, my daughter will send me a text, like Dad, what are you doing? It's all over Twitter. I can read your lips. This is embarrass-- and I'm embarrassed.</p><p begin="00:19:10.60" data-timestamp="1150.6">So why is that? It's a sense of right or wrong.

But it's not just them or their coaches or my son who are treating refs in ways they'd never treat an ordinary person. It's the fans in every arena who spend meaningful amounts of their time looking for the refs' mistakes on the JumboTron. It's the cable sports channels playing and replaying the refs' mistakes so their viewers can tweet and retweet about them. It's this entire infrastructure, seemingly built to focus attention on whatever mistakes the refs make for the sole purpose of generating outrage.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Crowd</h4><p begin="00:19:57.46" data-timestamp="1197.46"> (CHANTING) Ref, you suck!

Before you hate me for saying that, give me a moment to show why.</p><p begin="00:20:19.21" data-timestamp="1219.21">So we're walking across a parking lot in Secaucus, New Jersey. And there are chain hotels and motels in someone's idea of a mall. And we're surrounded on all sides by freeways. It's like what people think about when they tell jokes about New Jersey. And we're approaching a four-story, rectangular, otherwise nondescript concrete building.</p><p begin="00:20:46.13" data-timestamp="1246.13">There's a discreet little sign here that says NBA and shows a logo with a basketball player. Inside, a recent concession to the world we live in-- the Replay Center, a place where basketball referees review the calls made by other basketball referees in real time, to minimize referee error. The Replay Center was built to persuade people that life was fair.</p><p begin="00:21:16.34" data-timestamp="1276.34">And the door is locked.</p><p begin="00:21:20.36" data-timestamp="1280.36">Someone eventually unlocks the door and leads me down a hall filled with a lot of old basketball stuff-- jerseys and bobbleheads and basketballs and posters of Michael Jordan. The Replay Center was the ultimate man cave--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Borgia</h4><p begin="00:21:33.05" data-timestamp="1293.05"> Ultimate man cave, right?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:21:34.58" data-timestamp="1294.58"> It's also the latest weapon in the battle for fairness.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:21:37.24" data-timestamp="1297.24"> So this place, just on first view, is amazing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Borgia</h4><p begin="00:21:40.09" data-timestamp="1300.09"> It really is.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:21:40.49" data-timestamp="1300.49"> It's wall-to-wall screens, 110 of them. What's on them is whatever is captured by all the cameras in 29 NBA arenas across the country. They may have a screen somewhere with scores on it, but I didn't see it. And they're all muted. What you hear is referees staring at basketball games. What you see is nothing but angles on professional basketball courts.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Borgia</h4><p begin="00:22:03.92" data-timestamp="1323.92"> Nobody's ever walked in here and walked out and said, this place sucks.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:22:07.13" data-timestamp="1327.13"> That's Joe Borgia, who's run the center since 2014. Before he volunteered for Secaucus duty, he refereed NBA games. His father was an NBA ref before him. With a break in the late '60s, a Borgia has been reffing professional basketball games since 1946.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:22:25.94" data-timestamp="1345.94"> If you went back to your dad at the beginning of his career and said, this is what it's going to look like, what do you think he'd have said?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Borgia</h4><p begin="00:22:32.41" data-timestamp="1352.41"> If I told him we would have replay, he'd turn over in his grave, forget about a replay center.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:22:36.92" data-timestamp="1356.92"> Is that right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Borgia</h4><p begin="00:22:37.79" data-timestamp="1357.79"> Oh, absolutely.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:22:38.77" data-timestamp="1358.77"> You see, the refs used to insist on their authority. And everyone agreed that there was no better way to ensure the fairness of the game than to let the ref play god. The Replay Center is an admission that the ref is not god, that he makes mistakes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Borgia</h4><p begin="00:22:52.75" data-timestamp="1372.75"> I think the mention of replay, none of us liked it when we first heard it.

We're going to give you two good angles, all right? That's the first one. The other one's going to give you a better look.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:23:35.14" data-timestamp="1415.14"> The refs here sit dressed in black staring at screens, waiting for a signal from somewhere in America. The end of games is when they get most involved, because that's when fans and coaches and players are most likely to accuse some ref of having made the mistake that changed the outcome. Of course, a mistake at the beginning has just as much effect on a game as a mistake at the end, but the end is what people notice and get outraged about. So the justice at the end of the game must be more exact than it is at the beginning.</p><p begin="00:24:08.13" data-timestamp="1448.13">These Replay Center refs have video technicians with them, who can freeze a moment on screen, then zoom out or zoom in so that the entire screen contains only a player's fingertips or his toes. Here you just scroll through tiny slivers of the game, not the game itself. The sliver is where injustices might occur.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Borgia</h4><p begin="00:24:26.15" data-timestamp="1466.15"> I mean, goodness gracious, if you don't have slow motion in here or freeze frame, it's very difficult.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:24:31.65" data-timestamp="1471.65"> Of course, in slow motion, you can see things that the naked eye misses. Magicians sometimes perform during halftimes of the NBA games. When Joe Borgia slows it down, he can see how they do their tricks. It's kind of the same thing with the players.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Borgia</h4><p begin="00:24:46.04" data-timestamp="1486.04"> Exactly. I can go 1/60 of a second at a time. You're gonna pick a lot of little things up.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:24:51.05" data-timestamp="1491.05"> So what these players have gotten good at is creating optical illusions. And then--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Borgia</h4><p begin="00:24:54.56" data-timestamp="1494.56"> Of course.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:24:54.62" data-timestamp="1494.62"> The sort of things that a magician does.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Borgia</h4><p begin="00:24:56.51" data-timestamp="1496.51"> Well, isn't flopping an optical illusion?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:24:58.79" data-timestamp="1498.79"> Flopping is what they call it when a player pretends to have been knocked over by another player.

Did he throw his elbow out?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:25:24.96" data-timestamp="1524.96"> The refs need to decide if the violence was not just excessive but unsportsmanlike, which sounds archaic, because we've sort of lost the concept.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Borgia</h4><p begin="00:25:34.09" data-timestamp="1534.09"> Did he lead--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Referee</h4><p begin="00:25:34.70" data-timestamp="1534.7"> But the foul was on Kevin Love.

It's ugly.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:25:45.06" data-timestamp="1545.06"> The players all stand around scratching themselves while the refs put on headsets and talk to the Replay Center.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:25:50.85" data-timestamp="1550.85"> So the blood doesn't sway the decision?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Borgia</h4><p begin="00:25:53.91" data-timestamp="1553.91"> Listen, there's a lot of contact.

That was accidental.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:25:57.96" data-timestamp="1557.96"> The only thing stopping the Replay Center from checking every decision is that it slows the game down. Here in Secaucus, they're still trying to figure out how they might talk to the refs as they run up and down the court. Because if they could do that, they could just fix every call on the fly.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Borgia</h4><p begin="00:26:13.17" data-timestamp="1573.17"> The special forces, we found that we actually use a chip over the molar that worked off the vibration of the bone.

For example, they've brought in serious managers to hire and train the refs.</p><p begin="00:27:17.85" data-timestamp="1637.85">Joe Borgia calls his boss the general, because she actually was a general and an Air Force pilot. Her name is Michelle Johnson, and before she supervised NBA refs, she ran the Air Force Academy. It sounds like overkill to use a general to make sure basketball games are well reffed. But the NBA thought it needed overkill.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:27:37.50" data-timestamp="1657.5"> So adjust your mic a little bit.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:27:38.92" data-timestamp="1658.92"> Or at least Adam Silver, the NBA commissioner did.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adam Silver</h4><p begin="00:27:41.25" data-timestamp="1661.25"> If people don't believe that the league office is unbiased and that the officials are unbiased, you're going to have a problem regardless of the accuracy of the calls.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:27:50.55" data-timestamp="1670.55"> People watching at home are scrutinizing every call on their phones and their TVs. They had just enough information to be suspicious of the league.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adam Silver</h4><p begin="00:27:59.16" data-timestamp="1679.16"> There's 18 cameras covering every game, that there's 18,000 people watching games with sophisticated smartphones that have high definition audio and video. We started to get into trouble.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:28:11.70" data-timestamp="1691.7"> Silver took over in 2014 and also hired Joe Borgia to run the Replay Center. Since then, he's taken a ridiculous amount of grief, just for trying to improve the justice on a basketball court.</p><p begin="00:28:24.47" data-timestamp="1704.47">So here's what else Silver's done. He's broadened the pool of people from which refs are selected. They used to be mostly white men, mostly from the same background. At one point, four NBA refs came from the same high school. He's hired more black refs and female refs.</p><p begin="00:28:41.69" data-timestamp="1721.69">He's insisted that referees be physically fit so they can get into position to see all the plays. While everyone else in America is getting fatter, the refs are getting buff. They're also now getting new feedback on all their bad calls. Silver decided to publish the mistakes made by every ref in the last two minutes of every game so everyone could see them. He gives the teams and the refs a private document listing every refereeing mistake.</p><p begin="00:29:07.84" data-timestamp="1747.84">All this new data on refs means that we and they know all sorts of strange things about their minds. For instance, we now know that their calls have tended to favor whichever team is losing. Their calls also favor the home team. Some large part of home court advantage is just the refs.</p><p begin="00:29:23.59" data-timestamp="1763.59">The analytics department of the Houston Rockets has even done a study that shows that the home team that gets the best calls is the Utah Jazz. Why Utah? Who knows? But you can be sure that someone will figure that out. There's now basically a small army of geeks analyzing all this new data.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Justin Wolfers</h4><p begin="00:29:39.61" data-timestamp="1779.61"> Look, I don't really like writing papers about sports.

This is arguably the most analyzed workforce in the country.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:30:09.42" data-timestamp="1809.42"> Basketball referees are now picked apart in ways that not long ago would have seemed preposterous-- not just for the fairness of their calls but for their unconscious behavior. Wolfers took data from over a decade of NBA basketball games, more than 250,000 of them. Then he set out to look for evidence of the refs' racial bias.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Justin Wolfers</h4><p begin="00:30:29.73" data-timestamp="1829.73"> The question here isn't whether people are anti-black or anti-white but whether there's an in-group bias. So if a predominately black team is playing and the refereeing crew is predominantly white, are there more fouls called against them than on nights when the same team is playing with a predominantly black refereeing crew? And it turns out, the answer is yes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:30:53.59" data-timestamp="1853.59"> Wolfers wrote his paper back in 2007, before this new age of referee transparency.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Justin Wolfers</h4><p begin="00:30:59.48" data-timestamp="1859.48"> Well, it was a bit of a lesson for me. You can probably tell by my accent, Michael, I'm an Australian. You know, I thought it was an interesting piece of social science. It turned out <i>The</i> <i>New</i> <i>York</i> <i>Times</i> put it on the front page.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:31:10.05" data-timestamp="1870.05"> And the NBA wasn't happy.

The result of all this coverage, every single referee was made aware of his unconscious bias. When the dust settled, Justin Wolfers was curious to know if his paper had had any effect. He made another study of referees after the controversy he'd created. And guess what.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Justin Wolfers</h4><p begin="00:31:50.29" data-timestamp="1910.29"> The most recent study that we did seems to suggest that that form of racial bias has gone away.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:31:55.11" data-timestamp="1915.11"> For a while anyway. He has no idea why. Maybe simply making the refs aware of the problem was enough to correct it. By the way, the NBA disputes this study too. But in the end, this became a case study-- not in ref ineptitude but in ref reform. NBA refs have now achieved what police forces can only dream of, though the refs have no choice. The world's now too good at seeing their mistakes.</p><p begin="00:32:27.85" data-timestamp="1947.85">Look, there's no way any basketball referee is going to be perfect. But there's also no way these refs are anything but more accurate than they've ever been. I mean, even home court advantage means less than it used to.

How could it not have? The mystery is why the stars and the coaches and the fans act as if it's gotten worse. Sitting in the NBA replay center in Secaucus, New Jersey, I get a hunch about that. After I see all these people on all these TV screens jumping around and hollering at refs, the ruckus appears to be confined to Cleveland. But in here, it feels like the entire universe is disturbed. There's a reason for this. LeBron James is upset.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:36:52.89" data-timestamp="2212.89"> See? He's arguing. There he goes.

There's no signal to us to do anything in the Replay Center. LeBron's drama, strictly speaking, is pointless. It's strange the way these players argue.

I sometimes don't even know which teams are playing. But every time a player gets up into a referee's face, I've recognized the player. And I actually don't know that many NBA players, but I know all the ones who pitch these hissy fits, because the only players getting up into the faces of the refs are the famous players, or the coaches who protect them.</p><p begin="00:38:09.54" data-timestamp="2289.54">Ramona Shelburne put her finger on it. The more aggressive behavior towards refs isn't coming from every player. It's coming from the stars.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ramona Shelburne</h4><p begin="00:38:16.97" data-timestamp="2296.97"> It's just different than in the past. Like, you know, when you're a star, I think there's this feeling that you've sort of risen above reproach. You get used to a certain level of treatment. You get used to people who treat you that way.

And I got to the four-way stop sign, and I was halfway through this four-way stop sign--</p><p begin="00:39:27.72" data-timestamp="2367.72">[MOTOR RUNNING]</p><p begin="00:39:29.62" data-timestamp="2369.62"></p><p begin="00:39:31.04" data-timestamp="2371.04">And this guy in a black Mercedes rolls through the stop sign, is halfway there, is a foot away from me about to take me out, and he's on his cell phone. And I looked at him. I was ready to take him on, like, all right, buddy, this is it. And what was most telling about this whole experience was he looked at me as if I was in the wrong and I should get out of his way, you know, even though I had made it through the stop sign first.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:39:54.32" data-timestamp="2394.32"> So Dacher and a colleague dreamed up this weird experiment. They hid two Berkeley undergraduates in the bushes near four-way stop signs. The undergrads noted the makes of all cars coming through the intersection, assigned them numbers, one to five, according to their market value. A new Mercedes was a five, a Honda was a three, and an old Pacer was a one.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dacher Keltner</h4><p begin="00:40:17.55" data-timestamp="2417.55"> We positioned a Berkeley undergrad by a pedestrian zone, and we make sure they look like they want to cross the street. And they're sort of leaning into their pedestrian zone, where it's required by California law to stop.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:40:31.02" data-timestamp="2431.02"> It's a game of one-on-one at a California crosswalk-- one car versus one pedestrian.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dacher Keltner</h4><p begin="00:40:36.80" data-timestamp="2436.8"> And 0% of the drivers of poor cars zoomed through the pedestrian zone. They all stopped. And 40-some odd percent-- 45% of the drivers of the fives, the rich cars, blazed through the pedestrian zone, and just say, the rules don't apply to me. I'll carry on.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:41:01.16" data-timestamp="2461.16"> This one study led to a bunch of others that showed basically the same pattern of human behavior.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dacher Keltner</h4><p begin="00:41:06.84" data-timestamp="2466.84"> Another experiment, we bring people to the lab. And as they're leaving, there's this big bowl of candy. And it's like-- and it says on it, "for the children of the Institute of Human Development," on the bowl.</p><p begin="00:41:20.21" data-timestamp="2480.21">And we say, oh, you know, take a candy or two as you're leaving. And we count up how many candies they take after they leave the experiment. Privileged people grab a big handful of candy, compared to poorer people.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:41:31.43" data-timestamp="2491.43"> So let's turn the conversation to something much more important, which is basketball.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dacher Keltner</h4><p begin="00:41:34.55" data-timestamp="2494.55"> Most important of all.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:41:36.41" data-timestamp="2496.41"> In the last five or six years, the NBA has embarked on essentially a dramatic reform of refereeing.

The people who are getting thrown out of games are Kevin Durant and Steph Curry and James Harden. And the Warriors, the most famous team ever to walk on the court, are the chief culprits-- exhibit A in bad behavior towards refs. So you've got this weird combination.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dacher Keltner</h4><p begin="00:42:08.47" data-timestamp="2528.47"> Yeah. No, that's fascinating. I still remember being a Lakers fan-- you know, the great Magic Johnson teams. And watching Larry Bird do his nine-step lay-up. And I'm like, come on, make the call.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:42:20.00" data-timestamp="2540"> For most players of his era, that would have counted as traveling.

And it's more profound than it was in Larry Bird's era. Yeah Larry Bird was a millionaire. LeBron James might be a billionaire. And these guys are global franchises.

Here's what I think.</p><p begin="00:43:06.53" data-timestamp="2586.53">The stars used to get more calls in their favor than they do now, just because they were stars. Objective refs have eliminated some of their privilege. The more objectivity there is, the less power they have. And to them, that's outrageous.</p><p begin="00:43:29.10" data-timestamp="2609.1">I think American life just now has at least one thing in common with basketball-- the authority of its referees is under attack.

  <h3>Act Two: The Fairer Sex</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:47:03.71" data-timestamp="2823.71"> It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Today's program, "No Fair," stories about people young and old all over our country feeling a sense of injustice, feeling wronged, and not getting satisfaction from the people in charge. We have arrived at Act Two of our program. Act Two, The Fairer Sex. And for this act, let's go to Broadway. There's a show right now that starts with this true story.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:47:26.94" data-timestamp="2846.94"> When I was 15 years old, I would travel the country giving speeches about the Constitution at American Legion halls for prize money. This was a scheme invented by my mom to help me pay for college. I would travel to big cities like Denver and Fresno. I would give a speech, win a whole bunch of money, and then bring it back to put in my little safety deposit box for later.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:47:51.82" data-timestamp="2871.82"> This is Heidi Schreck in the show <i>What</i> <i>the</i> <i>Constitution</i> <i>Means</i> <i>to</i> <i>Me.</i> I loved this show. It's totally original in what it's about and in how it tells its story. It's very funny. It's a very patriotic show in this totally uncorny way.</p><p begin="00:48:06.04" data-timestamp="2886.04">In the show, Heidi Schreck recreates the idealistic speech that she gave at 15 that won her enough money to pay for her whole college education. And then she talks about the Constitution and about her own life. Our show today is about fairness, and Heidi Schreck, to be clear, says that her 15-year-old self definitely saw the Constitution as a powerful instrument enforcing fairness.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:48:28.32" data-timestamp="2908.32"> I believed it made our country fairer, more equal, more democratic. I believed that wholeheartedly.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:36.50" data-timestamp="2916.5"> At 15?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:48:37.19" data-timestamp="2917.19"> At 15.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:37.98" data-timestamp="2917.98"> Mm-hmm. You said that as a kid you had a crush on the Constitution.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:48:41.89" data-timestamp="2921.89"> (CHUCKLING) Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:43.24" data-timestamp="2923.24"> What does that mean?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:48:45.33" data-timestamp="2925.33"> I was really excited by it. I was a very idealistic, nerdy young person. And researching and reading about the Constitution-- my dad is a history teacher and talked very passionately about the genius of this document and its ability to evolve and to somehow surpass and rectify the flaws of its founders. Like, this idea that there was a document that could be created by flawed people that could be better than the people who made it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:24.51" data-timestamp="2964.51"> When you say that I'm reminded of this famous quote from Bill Clinton where he said-- and I think this is such a beautiful quote, too-- where he said, there's nothing that's wrong with America that what's right with America can't fix.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:49:35.84" data-timestamp="2975.84"> Yes. I mean, Frederick Douglass has the similar quote which is that, like, yes, the Constitution was founded on the great evil compromise of slavery but that it also contained the means by which we could rectify that evil.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:55.41" data-timestamp="2995.41"> And so your play is partly about that hopeful feeling that you had about the Constitution when you were a kid.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:50:00.42" data-timestamp="3000.42"> Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:00.68" data-timestamp="3000.68"> But also how you came to see it once you became an adult, as a deeply flawed document. You talk in the play about how especially the Constitution and American law really did not address things that affect you and members of your family, especially the women in your family, for just a long time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:50:17.81" data-timestamp="3017.81"> Yes, yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:18.55" data-timestamp="3018.55"> And when it did finally get around to addressing women, it was late, and it came to it kind of creakily.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:50:26.49" data-timestamp="3026.49"> Yes, very creakily.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:27.68" data-timestamp="3027.68"> And there's a large section of the play where you talk about how to get women to be covered by the Constitution, lawyers and the justices had to kind of jury rig women into having rights using, for example, the Ninth Amendment.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:50:40.05" data-timestamp="3040.05"> Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:40.47" data-timestamp="3040.47"> Can I ask you to just explain what the Ninth Amendment does?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:50:43.72" data-timestamp="3043.72"> Sure, sure. So the Ninth Amendment, which was my favorite as a kid, says, the enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage other rights.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:57.12" data-timestamp="3057.12"> I just want to say for radio, anyone that's listening, that you're just reciting that from memory.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:51:00.48" data-timestamp="3060.48"> I'm just reciting from memory. Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:51:02.04" data-timestamp="3062.04"> OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:51:03.27" data-timestamp="3063.27"> Well, it's technically "shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people," meaning that just because a certain right is not explicitly given to you in the Constitution, it doesn't mean you don't have that right. This amendment allows for the fact that the founders could not have imagined the future that we're living in now.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:51:28.12" data-timestamp="3088.12"> Well, it's like them admitting it. It's like, we can't think through every possible thing in this one document.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:51:32.41" data-timestamp="3092.41"> Right. I also like to think that in 300 years they knew that the world would look very different.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:51:38.37" data-timestamp="3098.37"> And in the play, though, you say, to actually get this thing to apply to women, Justice William O. Douglas has to come up with a concept which is so strange and so almost poetic, this idea of the penumbra.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:51:50.11" data-timestamp="3110.11"> Right.</p><p begin="00:51:51.64" data-timestamp="3111.64">What is a penumbra? Here I am standing in the light, and there you are sitting in the darkness. And this space between us, this space right here of partial illumination, this shadowy space right here, this is a penumbra.</p><p begin="00:52:11.80" data-timestamp="3131.8">William O. Douglas loved this penumbra metaphor and said that you could therefore take this idea that somewhere in the shadows of the Constitution, in this kind of in between shadowy space, are our rights we have not yet named. You could use the Ninth Amendment to essentially, like, shine a little light into the dark corners and say, OK, over there.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:35.56" data-timestamp="3155.56"> And then as you say in the show, the Ninth Amendment combines with the 14th Amendment in a kind of Wonder Twins, power activation moment--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:52:41.80" data-timestamp="3161.8"> Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:42.16" data-timestamp="3162.16"> --to decide <i>Roe</i> <i>versus</i> <i>Wade.</i></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:52:43.26" data-timestamp="3163.26"> Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:43.93" data-timestamp="3163.93"> But the Ninth Amendment is also the way that birth control gets legalized in the '60s. And let's hear-- we're going to hear an excerpt now from the play.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:52:53.46" data-timestamp="3173.46"> OK.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:53.89" data-timestamp="3173.89"> And this is where you talk about how that came about. And it begins with you explaining how you and a friend got birth control.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:52:59.58" data-timestamp="3179.58"> Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:00.45" data-timestamp="3180.45"> The same year you were doing these contests, when you were 15 you went to Planned Parenthood.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:53:04.62" data-timestamp="3184.62"> Neither of us were having sex yet, but just we wanted to be on birth control just in case. You know, just in case we were in a hot tub and sperms might happen to attack us.</p><p begin="00:53:14.89" data-timestamp="3194.89">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:53:17.39" data-timestamp="3197.39"></p><p begin="00:53:18.89" data-timestamp="3198.89">OK, I mean, you can laugh, but be careful. Or, you know, in case of a real attack. What I didn't realize at the time is that birth control had only been legal for all women in this country for about 15 years. I mean, I was 15. So I thought it had been legal since the dawn of time. But no, no.</p><p begin="00:53:41.54" data-timestamp="3221.54">In 1965, this incredible woman, Estelle Griswold, got herself arrested for dispensing IUDs to poor women at her Connecticut Planned Parenthood. She faced a year in prison, took her case all the way to the Supreme Court, and this, this is actually when William O. Douglas first pulled out his big penumbra metaphor. This is when he said for the first time that one thing the Constitution surely guarantees is the right to privacy, and that this allows a woman to put in an IUD as long as she is married and as long as her husband says that it is OK.</p><p begin="00:54:16.10" data-timestamp="3256.1">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:54:18.07" data-timestamp="3258.07"></p><p begin="00:54:18.56" data-timestamp="3258.56">This is a very scary moment for William O. Douglas because nobody understands the Ninth Amendment-- nobody, except for me at 15. Justice Scalia said he didn't even remember studying it in law school. But they had to dig up this amendment that nobody understands, because there was just no other way to deal with the female body.</p><p begin="00:54:39.32" data-timestamp="3279.32">Because they all wanted to make birth control legal. They did. They wanted it because-- well, because I found out that William O. Douglas, who was my hero when I was 15, Justice William O. Douglas was 67, and he was having an affair with a 22-year-old college student.</p><p begin="00:54:56.39" data-timestamp="3296.39">[GASPING]</p><p begin="00:54:56.90" data-timestamp="3296.9">So I'm thinking-- right? They want to find a way to get the birth control flowing. Actually, Arabella, can you play a snippet of the Supreme Court recording? This is the actual argument. So remember, it's 1965. There will not be a woman on this court until Sandra Day O'Connor arrives in 1981. Here are nine men deciding the fate of birth control.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Supreme Court Justice</h4><p begin="00:55:24.49" data-timestamp="3324.49"> All of these devices that are covered, that each of them has the potential dual function of acting in a contraceptive capacity and as a prevention of disease?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Supreme Court Justice</h4><p begin="00:55:35.95" data-timestamp="3335.95"> It's probably only true with respect to some. But some get by under the term "feminine hygiene."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Supreme Court Justice</h4><p begin="00:55:42.85" data-timestamp="3342.85"> And all this-- [CLEARING THROAT]-- uh-- [CLEARING THROAT]-- uh-- I just don't know about. But-- [CLEARING THROAT]-- uh-- [CLEARING THROAT]-- they are-- they are all sold in Connecticut drugstores on one theory or another.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Supreme Court Justice</h4><p begin="00:56:02.57" data-timestamp="3362.57"> Is there anything on the record to-- [CLEARING THROAT]-- to indicate-- [CLEARING THROAT]-- the standard of birth rate in Connecticut vis-a-vis the states that don't have such laws?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:56:16.19" data-timestamp="3376.19"> It's, like, four hours of that.</p><p begin="00:56:18.78" data-timestamp="3378.78">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:20.43" data-timestamp="3380.43"> When Heidi Schreck was publicizing her show, she did this interview with Tony Kushner, the playwright and the Pulitzer prize winner, probably best known for <i>Angels</i> <i>in</i> <i>America.</i> And in this interview, they had this interesting exchange. Kushner says to her that he thought that her show was partly about this thing that he has been writing about and thinking about ever since he wrote that movie about Abraham Lincoln a few years ago that Stephen Spielberg directed.</p><p begin="00:56:45.31" data-timestamp="3405.31">Kushner said that in his view, a central question of democracy is that there needs to be some kind of mystical bond holding everybody together. Lincoln talked about the mystic chords of memory and very consciously tried to pull everybody together into allegiance for the Union. But Kushner said that if you actually interrogate what the thing is that is actually pulling us together, it's really just a stack of paper, right? It's just an act of faith that we have with each other. And he pointed out that how, of course, everybody knows right now this act of faith, this feeling that we are all in this together and we are one people who can work things out together, that is in such short supply.</p><p begin="00:57:24.43" data-timestamp="3444.43">And the very idea of teenagers giving speeches about that stack of papers, about the Constitution, and its importance and its values, Kushner said-- I'm quoting here-- "It feels like an ethos of a not very distant and yet somehow very distant past, where people believe in fairness, that the superstructure that we've all sworn allegiance to, the Constitution, is going to create opportunities and possibilities." That really hit me when I read it. And I asked Heidi Schreck in our interview if she agreed that the America where she gave those speeches when she was 15 seemed very far away.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:58:02.27" data-timestamp="3482.27"> Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:58:03.41" data-timestamp="3483.41"> How so?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:58:04.58" data-timestamp="3484.58"> Well, so this was the '80s, between '86 and '89. First of all, I felt-- I mean, I was very liberal in high school. You know, I was feminist, liberal. Like, my speeches reflected those values, and I remember giving a speech about the Second Amendment, which I was arguing for gun control, because there had just been a shooting in California at a McDonald's. And I was arguing for strict gun control laws in front of a room of men who, you know, all owned guns and went hunting. And I won that contest.</p><p begin="00:58:36.78" data-timestamp="3516.78">And I always felt a sense that these men I was, you know, giving the speeches for supported my right to have a different view than they did, supported my right as an American to express myself, believed it was important in a democracy that we have these conversations together. So that felt different to me. I will also say, this was, like, the very beginning of Rush Limbaugh, you know, and then Fox News.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:59:02.15" data-timestamp="3542.15"> And those men who gave you award money after you argued against the--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:59:05.27" data-timestamp="3545.27"> Yeah, yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:59:06.06" data-timestamp="3546.06"> --the Second Amendment, you think that that would be-- it might be harder today.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:59:10.88" data-timestamp="3550.88"> I think so. Although I will say, I looked on YouTube at other American Legion speeches. And they still seem to be-- like, the winners often seem to be quite liberal. So at least maybe in the space of the American Legion, there's still room for this kind of dialogue.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:59:29.66" data-timestamp="3569.66"> I hope.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heidi Schreck</h4><p begin="00:59:30.56" data-timestamp="3570.56"> I hope too.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:59:38.07" data-timestamp="3578.07"> Heidi Schreck. If you're visiting New York City, her show <i>What</i> <i>the</i> <i>Constitution</i> <i>Means</i> <i>to</i> <i>Me,</i> is running through July on Broadway. A little Constitutional footnote here-- after we recorded that interview, I learned that the 14th and Ninth Amendments did not really combine Wonder Twins style to decide <i>Roe</i> <i>versus</i> <i>Wade.</i> Technically, the 14th decided <i>Roe,</i> with the Ninth justifying an important precedent that's cited in the case.</p><p begin="01:00:02.85" data-timestamp="3602.85">[MUSIC - "THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND" BY SHARON JONES AND THE DAP-KINGS]</p></div>  </div>
