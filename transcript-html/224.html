  <h3>Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.32" data-timestamp="0.32">We'll call this guy Chris. He had a job as a middleman, but a kind of odd sort of middleman.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:00:05.56" data-timestamp="5.56">We basically are the middleman between the deaf and someone who can hear.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:10.85" data-timestamp="10.85">Chris worked for a company that helped deaf people communicate over the telephone. To make a call, a deaf person would contact Chris. He would get the hearing person on the line. The deaf person would type what it is that they wanted to say. Chris would read this to the hearing person, and then type their responses back to the deaf person. Most of the conversations were what you'd expect: people calling their families, talking about what they had for dinner, calling their banks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:00:32.97" data-timestamp="32.97">And then again, because I usually worked nights, some of the calls were very intimate phone conversations between people breaking up, people just falling in love for the first time, people telling them that members of their family had died, phone sex, things no one would ever want you to hear, really.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:55.65" data-timestamp="55.65">One thing that happened more often than you'd think, especially when parents were talking to their kids, is that they would get into an argument, and then one of them would try to drag Chris into the argument on their side of it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:01:05.80" data-timestamp="65.8">And I wasn't allowed to say anything, so I would just say, the CA, we're co-communication assistants, does not have that information. That was the blanket phrase that they let me use.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:19.58" data-timestamp="79.58">That's so computer-like.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:01:21.20" data-timestamp="81.2">Well, that was the paradigm they wanted us to follow. They wanted us to be computers, basically, information machines. I remember a daughter had been, it was a deaf daughter, and she had been out sleeping around and doing a lot of drugs, evidently. And the mother was just trying to tell her that she needed to stop doing all these things and saying, "You may feel like you're young, and you can just do what you want, and since you're deaf, you feel you have an excuse to do all these things."</p><p begin="00:02:00.29" data-timestamp="120.29">And she started talking to me, and she said, "You don't do drugs, do you?" And I said, the CA does not have that information. And then she said, "Well, can't you just type to her and tell her that you think she's hurting herself as well?"</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:19.00" data-timestamp="139">Now when she's saying this to you, do you have to type that in, so the daughter knows that she's saying it to you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:02:24.36" data-timestamp="144.36">Yeah, you do. You have to type everything that she's saying. The daughter really disliked that. The daughter would start talking to me and say, "Don't let her talk to you." And she would start trying to tell me just how terrible the mother had been to her growing up. The mother actually said at this point, "This is really embarrassing," and tried to pretend like I wasn't there the rest of the time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:55.52" data-timestamp="175.52">It's hard to be the middleman. Pizza delivery places always hung up on Chris and the other operators. Phone sex operators and drug dealers were way more service-oriented when it came to the deaf. And then there were the people who liked to mess with the middleman, like two African-American guys one day, who started using all sorts of words and phrases just because it would be funny to hear the white operator say them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:03:15.17" data-timestamp="195.17">They were talking in really heavy street slang. One person was intent on having me use the n-word, over and over. And it was very uncomfortable. But the two people using it on the phone obviously didn't care. They just wanted to have me do it.</p><p begin="00:03:32.82" data-timestamp="212.82">And they were even joking about me doing it. They would just be laughing. A lot of people find a lot of amusement out of playing with a Communication Assistant. I found it kind of funny after a while.</p><p begin="00:03:47.31" data-timestamp="227.31">All of my friends who went through the training for this were young black women. And they thought I was kind of really straight. And they used to perk their ears up immediately as soon as they heard me get into any sort of ghetto speak, or whatnot.</p><p begin="00:04:06.79" data-timestamp="246.79">Because I can't do it. I didn't like it. But I wasn't going to read in a completely white bread tone of voice, either. I didn't want to do that. It was humiliating and funny at the same time.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:29.25" data-timestamp="269.25">Give another example of times it was hard just to be an information machine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:04:34.92" data-timestamp="274.92">A man actually had just fallen off a ladder in his garage. And he had gone deaf. And so he was calling up all his friends and telling them what had happened to him. And so these people were completely unfamiliar with the service.</p><p begin="00:04:55.18" data-timestamp="295.18">So I had to explain the service. They still didn't understand it. And then he had to tell them, explain what the service was, why he was using it, and how he had just gone deaf.</p><p begin="00:05:05.64" data-timestamp="305.64">And it was very obvious, I remember one man he had called, they were not that close. And the man obviously did not know how to react. He was having a really hard time. He just kept saying I'm sorry, over and over. And it was really excessive. And it was just really hard to keep telling all of it, knowing that you're going to have to tell six or seven people after this that this man has gone deaf.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:32.72" data-timestamp="332.72">And at the end of that, so now you as a person, you've been through this experience with him of now, the two of you have told a half dozen people that he's gone deaf. It must be hard that after you get off the phone with the last person, that you and he don't talk about what just happened.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:05:50.51" data-timestamp="350.51">Right. Sometimes people will say, because there is a 30-second window of time where I'm still on the line with him. I remember he typed, "Thank you so much. I'm sure that must have been very hard for you as well as me." So there is a brief moment of time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:18.87" data-timestamp="378.87">It's hard to be the middleman. It's hard to keep your feelings out of it. It hard to stay neutral. People want you to get involved, and they want you to get out of it. You can't win for losing. And I say this as a middle child.</p><p begin="00:06:29.82" data-timestamp="389.82">And there there's that whole "eliminate the middleman" thing, eliminate the middleman. If you Google the phrase "eliminate the middleman," you get 3,800 websites promising to eliminate middlemen of every kind for you, car dealers, realtors, stockbrokers, furniture stores, stamp sales, plus one site that has figured out a way to bypass the lousy crop of presidential candidates we're offered every four years. Eliminate the middleman, it promises. Satan for President in 2004.</p><p begin="00:07:00.69" data-timestamp="420.69">Well, from WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This American</i> <i>Life</i>, distributed by Public Radio International. Today on our program, middlemen. We will not eliminate him. We will not pass the savings on to you. No, no, no, for once, a defense of the beleaguered middleman in three acts, including a simple explanation of how you, yes, you, could have gotten rich off Michael Jordan, using the simple rules of market economics and a good down parka. Stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One: Show Me The Monet</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:31.71" data-timestamp="451.71"> Act One, Show Me the Monet. You know, you can't do a story about middlemen without a story about business and all the people who make their livings buying low and selling high, how they are sort of looking out for their customers, and sort of looking out for their product and their suppliers, and mainly looking out for themselves. And this story begins, as so many radio stories seem to these days, with a classifieds ad.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:07:54.55" data-timestamp="474.55">Triple-A tickets, all events, seven days, concerts, sports, theater, Lincoln Park. And then it's got the address and the phone number. For a lot of years, I worked here. And if someone had called this ad, called in the phone number here, I probably would have been the one to answer the phone.</p><p begin="00:08:11.52" data-timestamp="491.52">When people call this number, I don't know what kind of place they're imagining, maybe a fancy little office downtown. But we were actually in the back of a video store, in this little dark office, the ceiling fan going real slowly counter-clockwise, kind of squeaking, one beam of light coming through the tall window up top, and dust streaming around the room, and a dog's barking out back. I remember, for a while, there was not many movies on the shelves. There was <i>Buster,</i> that movie that Phil Collins made.</p><p begin="00:08:46.00" data-timestamp="526">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:08:49.27" data-timestamp="529.27">And no one would ever rent those movies.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:08:57.87" data-timestamp="537.87">How long did you work there?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:08:59.40" data-timestamp="539.4">On and off from '96 to about 2001. Over the course of those few years, I got to know the ticket world inside and out. I met people with names like 35th Street Eddie, South Side Frank, Fast Willie, Richie the Head. There was a guy named Elbow, who had sort of a big elbow.</p><p begin="00:09:21.02" data-timestamp="561.02">A lot of guys got nicknames after whatever event that they specialized in, Monet Joe. One time, there was a Monet exhibit at the art institute. So people come in from out of town, and they want to go to the exhibit. The only way they can go is if they have these VIP staff passes.</p><p begin="00:09:37.37" data-timestamp="577.37">And Monet somehow managed to have a few hundred of them. All the ticket brokers, all the ticket guys, all the hotel concierges, everyone was calling Monet. And from then on, he's just been called Monet.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:09:57.26" data-timestamp="597.26">So you came back to town and started to look up some of the people that you used to work with, right? And so who did you talk to first?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:10:06.16" data-timestamp="606.16">First, I looked up an old ticket friend named Liz. And we started talking about some of our old clients.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Liz</h4><p begin="00:10:11.43" data-timestamp="611.43">You spends so much time on the phone talking to the worst people. They're either mean, or they're rude. Ugh. And you're always putting people on hold, like, "Let me get my supervisor. Let me talk to my supervisor." And you're like, ptth. I'm not doing [BLEEP] for this guy. He stayed on hold. He'll hang up. He'll hang up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:10:27.96" data-timestamp="627.96">We call it the stew pot. When you left someone just on hold, you say let them stew for a  little while. And usually, if they're kind of hemming and hawing, going back and forth, you let them stew for a few, like five minutes. Maybe come on once and be like, "Hang in there, man. Hang in there. I'll be right back with you." Let them stew another five minutes. Then, after 10, they're ready to talk. They're ready to deal.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Liz</h4><p begin="00:10:48.69" data-timestamp="648.69">Yeah, definitely. We had the lead transfer him to this line that would ring and ring and ring. You're like, "Don't pick up line four. Everybody knows line four is [BLEEP] line. Don't pick it up."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:11:09.33" data-timestamp="669.33">That's so funny, because we always had the same thing. We had different lines that meant different things. You had a couple lines you had to answer different things. Like one line, you had to answer, hello. Like any time we try to get act tickets through legitimate means, like group sales or anything like that. You would put the home phone number. So it said on all the phones, hello. There was a little taped-up piece of paper that said "hello" on it to remind you to answer it "hello?"</p><p begin="00:11:38.76" data-timestamp="698.76">This was a phone line that was supposed to simulate an actual home, someone's residence. You were just supposed to pick it up and say, "Hello?" This was when we ordered group sale tickets from the Cubs. So we put in orders for tons of group sales. And if they knew we were a ticket broker, they wouldn't be having it. We wouldn't get the tickets. So we'd pick different names of organizations.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:12:03.31" data-timestamp="723.31">They actually would check, though?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:12:05.60" data-timestamp="725.6">No, they would just call you. And they would be like, what's the name of your organization? And sometimes you would say, "Oh, well, it's Grandpa Louie's 70th birthday. So we're bringing 40 people to that game." Or, "The Little League hockey team that I coach, we're having a special slumber party. And we need 120 tickets. We got tykes coming from all over, up and down the state. They're all-stars. You should see some of these kids. They're really fine hockey players."</p><p begin="00:12:39.88" data-timestamp="759.88">There was another phone line that if it rang, you were just supposed to pick the phone line up and not say anything at all, just pick it up and put it to your ear and be silent. That was Guy Lobster, who owned the business. That was one of his special lines. And it was important that just didn't say anything. You weren't supposed to let them hear your voice, even. So just pick it up and be silent. Actually, I never figured out what that one was for.</p><p begin="00:13:18.17" data-timestamp="798.17">There's a guy named Leo, who was one of my best friends of all the ticket guys. And a couple days ago, I was in Ann Arbor, at a Michigan football game, and Leo was out there, buying and selling. I saw a couple of the old guys I knew, so they'd come in from all over. And Leo was out there. So I put this mic on his collar, attached the battery pack to his butt, and just listened to him walk around.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:13:42.34" data-timestamp="822.34">Anybody got one extra ticket? Anybody got one extra?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:13:47.20" data-timestamp="827.2">What is this called, actually, what he's doing now? Is there a term for what he's doing?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:13:50.59" data-timestamp="830.59">Yeah, he's walking the walk. The area by the stadium or by the concert hall is called the walk. And then you're walking the walk. You're saying, "Who needs two?"</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:14:00.40" data-timestamp="840.4">So he's just showed up here without any tickets.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:14:02.27" data-timestamp="842.27">Right. He's trying to buy some tickets, so then he can turn them around, and, we say "flip 'em," so he can flip  them for some dough, flip them for a profit.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:14:11.14" data-timestamp="851.14">You got one extra? How much do you want for it? 20?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:14:14.47" data-timestamp="854.47">We're at row 60.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:14:16.33" data-timestamp="856.33">Row 60? How about 15?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:14:18.12" data-timestamp="858.12">How about 20?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:14:19.81" data-timestamp="859.81">20?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:14:20.43" data-timestamp="860.43">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:14:20.85" data-timestamp="860.85">18?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:14:21.26" data-timestamp="861.26">$49 ticket.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:14:22.52" data-timestamp="862.52">OK. Sure you can't do 15?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:14:25.89" data-timestamp="865.89">I'll do 18, but that's it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:14:29.21" data-timestamp="869.21">There you go.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:14:30.16" data-timestamp="870.16">Got it. Thanks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:14:31.22" data-timestamp="871.22">Thanks.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:14:32.66" data-timestamp="872.66">OK, so I actually timed this. From the moment he says "Thank you, man," to the moment he runs into another person is exactly 1 minute and 20 seconds.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:14:43.06" data-timestamp="883.06">You guys need tickets? I got one. I'd sell it for 100.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:14:46.77" data-timestamp="886.77">You'd sell it for 100? Yeah, midfield.</p><p begin="00:14:48.95" data-timestamp="888.95">We ain't got that--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:14:49.88" data-timestamp="889.88">Wait a minute. He just tried to sell it for $100?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:14:53.18" data-timestamp="893.18">You get what you can, you know? You might as well start high. You never know. Maybe the guy's going to pull out $100 and say, here. It can't hurt to start at $100 and come down.</p><p begin="00:15:04.59" data-timestamp="904.59">You can't go up. You can't say $30, and if the guy says, "Only 30?" Be, "Oh, no, no, no. 50." Start as high-- you can always come down.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chris</h4><p begin="00:15:20.74" data-timestamp="920.74">Did you have other techniques that you used when you were doing this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:15:25.28" data-timestamp="925.28">There's a whole psychology to what to do to sell someone tickets. Like when I was on the street, outside of the United Center, say, at a Bulls game, I'd present myself differently to different people, depending on what I thought they wanted out of this ticket-buying transaction. Some guys would be kind of nervous. And I'd see him walking up, and all the hustlers going up to him, trying to sell him tickets. And they'd look all wary. And they'd have a couple kids with them.</p><p begin="00:15:51.37" data-timestamp="951.37">So then I'd go up to them, and I'd just be like, "Sir, my uncle couldn't come to the game tonight. But I do have this extra ticket, if you guys want to come. They're great seats. I sit in them every game with my uncle." And I made him feel comfortable buying tickets from me.</p><p begin="00:16:08.62" data-timestamp="968.62">And sometimes, there were the guys who, they'd come with a few friends. And they wanted to show off that they could work with our underworld element, that they knew how to deal with scalpers. They'd be like, "I'll take care of it." They'd say to their friends, you'd see them, "I'll be right back." And they'd come up to me.</p><p begin="00:16:27.87" data-timestamp="987.87">And then I'd be the hardened street hustler. And I'd be looking around constantly. I'd be saying, "Come on, man. The heat's tight out here tonight. Work with me. Work with me. What are you payin'? What are you payin'? What do you need?" Just trying to make them feel like they were really wheeling and dealing.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:16:48.57" data-timestamp="1008.57">Did you always win? Did the customer ever have a chance?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:16:57.83" data-timestamp="1017.83">Really, out of every transaction, both people win. If they paid you it, then they could afford it. So many people would buy tickets from me at just what I imagine to be an exorbitant-- I myself was like, this price is ridiculous. And yet, they would be so happy. They would be glowing. And they were so appreciative and thankful to me, for getting them into the game.</p><p begin="00:17:25.75" data-timestamp="1045.75">But I did make it a rule, sometimes a point of pride, to not let them go in with any, you know, to see how much money they had in their wallet. And I was going to take all of it. They didn't need popcorn in the game. They didn't need a beer.</p><p begin="00:17:49.16" data-timestamp="1069.16">Being a ticket broker is different than being in other businesses, where if you run a bar, and you run out of Bud Lite, you call up and have them pull that truck right up out back in the loading dock and wheel about 20 cases off. But when you want to get tickets, it's not that simple. There's no easy way to do it. So ticket brokers have to rely on just a whole network of shadowy associates to bring the tickets into them.</p><p begin="00:18:21.46" data-timestamp="1101.46">There's a guy named Moose who has a whole bike gang. And every year, when Cubs games would go on sale, at the Cubs on sale, you're only allowed to buy eight tickets for up to eight games, so 64 tickets total. He would get about 15 of his biker friends. He would just keep them up all night on Friday night drinking, merrymaking, singing, whatever it would take.</p><p begin="00:18:47.54" data-timestamp="1127.54">So when the tickets went on sale, he'd then have 15 guys who were waiting there. And hopefully the weren't passed out. They were waiting there to buy 64 tickets each. When he brings them in to the ticket broker, the broker will pay him $10 over the face value for each ticket.</p><p begin="00:19:02.23" data-timestamp="1142.23">At the Bulls on sales, they started doing this lottery system. They didn't want people to just be camping out two weeks beforehand, because they knew that these tickets were going to be worth so much. So a couple enterprising ticket brokers started rounding up the homeless guys around Chicago.</p><p begin="00:19:18.49" data-timestamp="1158.49">The actually would rent a school bus, and they would drive around Chicago, just pulling people into the bus, promising them $10 or $20 if they'd come hang out for the morning. Sometimes they'd even pull up in front of the homeless shelter right down there on South Wabash or South State and just toot the horn. And all the guys would come filing out and fill up the bus.</p><p begin="00:19:39.45" data-timestamp="1179.45">They'd drive them down to the United Center box office window. When the tickets went on sale, you'd have, out of the first 60 people in line, there'd be 50 homeless guys waiting to buy these $100 tickets. And the brokers would just give them a few hundred bucks each to buy the tickets they wanted.</p><p begin="00:19:59.38" data-timestamp="1199.38">Every once in a while, tickets would be released into the system. Suddenly they would become available. A game that had been sold out, suddenly there are six tickets that are available. And maybe it's a season ticket holder who has canceled, and said, "I can't come to this game."</p><p begin="00:20:13.37" data-timestamp="1213.37">Or David Stern, the NBA commissioner, he actually has four front row seats to every game in the NBA, every night. And there's no way that he can go to every game every night. In fact, a lot of nights he doesn't go to any game.</p><p begin="00:20:29.28" data-timestamp="1229.28">So sometime the day of the game, they'll release those seats. And those four beautiful seats will suddenly become available into the system. So whoever's the first person to phone in, go to a window, or punch in online at that precise second is going to be the one that gets them.</p><p begin="00:20:45.48" data-timestamp="1245.48">So Monet, Monet Joe, what he would do is all night, he would just hang out at his computer, keep pecking, pecking, pecking away, with the Grateful Dead playing and smoking a J and just pecking away, pecking away. Usually it says, "Sorry, your selection is not available." He would peck again, one ticket. He might peck 1,000 times. But then all of a sudden, your screen lights up and gives you that section and row number and says, "Would you like to finish this purchase?" And you know you just made-- you can buy that ticket for face value, which is about as low as you can buy a ticket, and sell it for 10 times that, sometimes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:21:33.03" data-timestamp="1293.03">During the time that you worked, during those five years that you worked as a scalper, how was the money?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:21:40.36" data-timestamp="1300.36">It was pretty phat. It was sick. It was humongous. I had a suitcase of money.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:21:51.34" data-timestamp="1311.34">You had a literal suitcase of money?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:21:53.33" data-timestamp="1313.33">Yeah. It was actually so much money that I didn't want to deposit it at one time in a bank. I didn't want to freak out the bank manager or anything like that. So I would put a little bit in one bank, a little bit in another bank. And then there was a third bank where I had a safety deposit box. And I would just stuff the cash into the safety deposit box.</p><p begin="00:22:19.05" data-timestamp="1339.05">The Bulls days, Michael Jordan, were really the golden age of tickets in Chicago. There's always peaks and valleys. And I'm sure Yankees tickets are pretty nice now. Laker tickets are alright. But it was a rare, it wasn't just one sports team having a nice run. It really became something that-- it became the focus of the entire world.</p><p begin="00:22:45.27" data-timestamp="1365.27">You'd meet people from Sweden and Japan and Korea and England and Germany, and you were like a celebrity to them. You had what everybody else in the world wanted. You had a stack of tickets to the Chicago Bulls game. And people would do anything for them, and they would pay any price.</p><p begin="00:23:07.15" data-timestamp="1387.15">We felt like we were part of something bigger than us. We felt like we were part of this historical moment. The day Michael Jordan retired in 1998, in June, that's the same day I retired.</p><p begin="00:23:34.83" data-timestamp="1414.83">Michael Jordan probably sits around with his cousins and friends and talked about his great shots that he made, his game-winning dunks. Some of the ticket people sit around and talk about the great sales that they made for Bulls games. Like, I talked to my friend, John, and he's got a story about it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John</h4><p begin="00:23:51.80" data-timestamp="1431.8">An old lady was walking down the street. She passed all the hustlers up. And nobody had thought to ask her. But I was walking down the street, and I just said, "Do anybody have any extra tickets?"</p><p begin="00:24:03.20" data-timestamp="1443.2">She said, "Do you need tickets?" I said, "Yeah." And she said, "Yeah, I got a couple of extra tickets, section 111, row 15."</p><p begin="00:24:13.87" data-timestamp="1453.87">These was the best tickets. These was in center court, 15 rows from the floor. She sold me the tickets at $85 each, which at that time, was face value tickets. I, in turn, didn't even get a chance to walk 10 feet away after I bought the tickets.</p><p begin="00:24:28.74" data-timestamp="1468.74">A whole gang of people got around me. And everybody was bidding on them. When we got finished bidding with those tickets, those tickets sold at $1,200 cash a ticket.</p><p begin="00:24:48.10" data-timestamp="1488.1">I was so happy. And the guy that bought them was a Chinese man. Him and his wife went. They thought I was God, because they had the best seats. And I stuffed the money in my pocket and skipped on down the street.</p><p begin="00:25:05.01" data-timestamp="1505.01">But that was the most memorable thing. This is what a hustler dream of, of a deal like that, because you hardly ever find a deal like that. You can hardly ever find tickets on a Jordan day. Even if you do a ticket like that, you're going to pay a few hundred dollars for it, and then you're going to run around and try to sell it for big money.</p><p begin="00:25:24.71" data-timestamp="1524.71">But to get a deal like that, it just stays with you. There's nothing to say about a deal like that. Bought cheap, sold high, what more can I say?</p><p begin="00:25:43.74" data-timestamp="1543.74">Yeah, well, it's just not like it used to be during the Jordan era. What can I say? It's terrible. It is. It's bad.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:25:53.63" data-timestamp="1553.63">How bad is it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John</h4><p begin="00:25:55.42" data-timestamp="1555.42">Here, I'll show you. One day, I was at the White Sox, trying to sell tickets, right? And I had this guy that was going to buy a couple tickets from me. And wasn't charging a lot. And it was a $27 ticket. I was going to give it to him for $20 apiece. And a fan walked up and just gave him two tickets. That's how bad it was. And the guy said, "Thanks for talking to me," and went to the ballpark.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:26:27.49" data-timestamp="1587.49">It's a cold, dark, rainy, miserable, February day every day.

Each week on our program, of course, we choose some theme and bring you a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's program, Middlemen, in which we examine what it means to be the monkey in the middle. We have arrived at Act Two of our program, Act Two, Stuck Inside of Memphis.</p><p begin="00:29:12.74" data-timestamp="1752.74">A while back, there was a fire in Beth Landau's apartment building in New York. And when the firemen from around the corner were responding to the call, she and her mom, who was visiting, got to talking with one of them, a guy named Sal Princiatta. Sal was a huge Elvis fan. He looks a bit like Elvis. And as fate had it, Beth's mom went to high school in Memphis with Elvis. So there was a lot to talk about.</p><p begin="00:29:35.14" data-timestamp="1775.14">OK, time passes. After September 11th, Beth checks at the firehouse around the corner to see if Sal is OK. This is one of the units that lost a lot of guys. And it turns out that he survived. He's depressed. Like a lot of firefighters, he developed asthma from digging in the dust and the rubble in the weeks after September 11th, but he is alive.</p><p begin="00:29:52.17" data-timestamp="1792.17">She starts dropping by with food for the guys, hanging out. And wanting to do something nice for Sal, she organizes a trip to Memphis for him, to see Graceland. Other firemen from the house get interested in going. And in the end, in May of 2002, 18 of them went as guests of the Memphis Fire Department and many other sponsors, with stops at Al Green's church, all the varied requisite Elvis sights, and an appearance before 60,000 people at the Sunset Symphony on the banks of the Mississippi. And Sal found that for the people of Memphis who they met, he and the other guys were a very particular kind of middleman, a very unusual kind of middleman.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sal Princiatta</h4><p begin="00:30:30.57" data-timestamp="1830.57">When we arrived into Memphis, as soon as they find out who you are, you're a rock star.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:30:42.78" data-timestamp="1842.78">And now for what you have all been waiting for.

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:38:28.41" data-timestamp="2308.41"> Act Three, What It Takes to Tromp Through the Desert. So Moses was this great leader who brought the Israelites out of Egypt. One of the things the Bible says about him is that he was not much of a talker. Whenever he had to give a big speech or tell Pharaoh to let his people go, he would bring along his brother, Aaron, to do the talking for him. This is the story of somebody who's something like that.</p><p begin="00:38:48.61" data-timestamp="2328.61">Al Jurczynski is the middleman who is leading hundreds of people who live in New York City to the promised land of Schenectady, New York. And as he would tell you himself, what makes him good at his job is, he is just a normal guy. No flashy speeches. You aren't dazzled by charisma when you meet him. But you trust him.</p><p begin="00:39:05.64" data-timestamp="2345.64">Enough people trust him that he's accomplishing a very unlikely mission. Most of the people who he's convinced to move from the Bronx and Queens are people who immigrated there from the South American country of Guyana. These are people whose ancestors mostly came from India and Africa, moving to an old Rust Belt town of white ethnics. Our producer, Wendy Dorr, went to watch him work.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:39:26.20" data-timestamp="2366.2">Mayor Jurczynski is the sort of politician who's great at talking with old ladies or small businessmen, or really with anybody, for about a minute and a half. But after that, after his opening lines, he goes into this patter. If you hang around him for more than a few hours, you hear the same lines over and over. There are awkward jokes. But he's making such an effort that you kind of forgive him anything. Here he is, showing a busload of Guyanese New Yorkers around Schenectady.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Al Jurczynski</h4><p begin="00:39:54.05" data-timestamp="2394.05">But you know, there's people, Guyanese people, that have come here. And they said, "I've been to Schenectady. It's a little too slow for me. I like the fast pace of New York City." So that's understandable. And I like to tell people that come up here on the bus that if you like traffic jams, you should stay in New York City.</p><p begin="00:40:20.76" data-timestamp="2420.76">That was a joke. You know, my jokes are getting pretty old.</p><p begin="00:40:23.04" data-timestamp="2423.04">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:40:31.02" data-timestamp="2431.02">I know one thing. Whenever I run out of things to say when I'm talking to Guyanese people, all I got to do is mention cricket. And then everybody starts talking.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:40:39.50" data-timestamp="2439.5">He looks around the bus. Nobody starts talking.</p><p begin="00:40:44.62" data-timestamp="2444.62">In 1995, when he first ran for mayor, Schenectady was going through the same kinds of pains as lots of Rust Belt cities. The biggest employer, General Electric, had downsized from 40,000 employees to just a few thousand. Tens of thousands of people had moved away, or were forced to retire.</p><p begin="00:41:01.41" data-timestamp="2461.41">For a while, Al Jurczynski had this idea to lure Hasidic Jews to Schenectady. He wanted to repopulate certain problem neighborhoods with a group that was self-reliant, family-oriented, and tightly knit. That idea went nowhere. But then last year, some Guyanese people came to him for help getting an abandoned church for religious services.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Al Jurczynski</h4><p begin="00:41:22.54" data-timestamp="2482.54">Well, we talked. And I talked about public assistance. And we had had quite a problem with a lot of people coming up from New York City that were not coming up here to work, but were getting on public assistance. A lot of them were doing things that we didn't want them to do, namely get involved in the drug trade.</p><p begin="00:41:40.14" data-timestamp="2500.14">And they made it very clear, right up front, within probably the first 5 or 10 minutes that I met with them, that they don't believe in public assistance unless it's absolutely necessary. But it's against their culture to get on public assistance. And I heard that. I was extremely impressed by that. It was just so wonderful and so refreshing. And at that point, that's when I really I started to really embrace them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Herman Singh</h4><p begin="00:42:20.46" data-timestamp="2540.46">Thanks, folks, you're in tune to <i>Herman</i> <i>Singh</i> <i>Showtime.</i> It's 93.5 FM on your dial.

He's a realtor slash mortgage broker slash weekly radio host down in New York City, in the Queens neighborhood where most Guyanese live. It was his bright idea to bus Guyanese up to Schenectady every Saturday, to encourage them to buy houses up there. He pays for the buses himself, and promotes the trip like crazy on his weekly real estate slash music program, <i>Herman</i> <i>Singh</i> <i>Showtime.</i></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Herman Singh</h4><p begin="00:42:54.02" data-timestamp="2574.02">If you're planning to purchase a property in Schenectady, our next trip is actually going up to Schenectady on Saturday. And room with friends, if you are selling your property--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:43:02.04" data-timestamp="2582.04">At the beginning of the mayor's initiative to bring Guyanese to Schenectady five months ago, the mayor went on Herman's radio show and gave out his personal cell phone number on the air, a political gesture he explains this way.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Al Jurczynski</h4><p begin="00:43:14.22" data-timestamp="2594.22">I have free incoming calls. So if I was paying for the incoming calls, I wouldn't have done it. And I'd do it again.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:43:26.53" data-timestamp="2606.53">He gives me a sheepish look, and then blurts--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Al Jurczynski</h4><p begin="00:43:29.27" data-timestamp="2609.27">857-4000, area code 518. If you want to buy a home in Schenectady, give me a call.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:43:42.54" data-timestamp="2622.54">One Saturday in December, I schlep out to Queens at 6:30 in the morning to take the bus tour myself. And while two dozen of us wait for the bus to arrive, I meet Ali Latif. He's 60 years old, and he's been living in the Bronx with his wife for the last 14 years. His black hair is perfectly parted on one side. And he's wearing a clean Oxford shirt buttoned to the collar.</p><p begin="00:44:04.44" data-timestamp="2644.44">He tells me that he works as a doorman in Manhattan. And since he had to miss a day of work to come on the trip, and because he missed the bus by five minutes the week before, the trip is actually costing him $260. To be sure he doesn't miss the bus again, he's been waiting here since 5:30 this morning.</p><p begin="00:44:21.54" data-timestamp="2661.54">And when he starts talking about why he's thinking of moving to Schenectady, he repeats over and over, his voice raised, pointing his long, thin finger at my nose, that he's not on a joy ride. He's a serious businessman, looking for an opportunity.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ali Latif</h4><p begin="00:44:36.24" data-timestamp="2676.24">So I lose two day's pay just to go check this place out. It means that I'm not joking. $260 are losing, right?</p><p begin="00:44:46.70" data-timestamp="2686.7">I am going here on business. I am personally going here on business. I am a serious chap. That is what I'm saying. I don't make joke with business.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:45:02.28" data-timestamp="2702.28">It's a three-hour bus ride to Schenectady. And when we pull into town, it's not pretty. We pass abandoned gas stations and empty store fronts and ugly, rundown apartment buildings. And then, in the middle of nothing, is City Hall. And City Hall is spectacular, obviously just renovated with gleaming marble, the kind of old government building that's so beautiful, that the thought crosses your mind, "Maybe I should work in government."</p><p begin="00:45:29.70" data-timestamp="2729.7">And there, lined up in front as our bus pulls up, are a chorus of clean, perky white men in multi-colored golf shirts.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:45:37.01" data-timestamp="2737.01">It's a long way, isn't it?</p><p begin="00:45:38.74" data-timestamp="2738.74">We've got beautiful weather for you here today, if nothing else, huh? Good morning. You have a nice ride up? These are the important guys with the food, right? Come on up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:45:49.96" data-timestamp="2749.96">We are led like little, sleepy sheep into an intimidating-looking room with leather chairs lining the perimeter. Everybody looks a little scared. Ali, the serious businessman who is not on a joy ride, picks a seat close to the front.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:46:04.73" data-timestamp="2764.73">Good morning. I want to welcome you. It's my job to talk a little bit about the general economy, the history of Schenectady. Schenectady was founded about 300 years ago as a Dutch trading settlement.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:46:19.49" data-timestamp="2779.49">This speech, by the city's Director of Economic Development, pretty much sets the tone for what's to follow all day, mind-numbingly boring facts, which go on and on and on, peppered with the kinds of utterly sincere-sounding appeals that you almost never hear from any government official, anywhere.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:46:36.01" data-timestamp="2796.01">--because quite frankly, you're a great opportunity for us. And please know that we want you and need you. And so we hope you find us as much of an opportunity as we find you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:46:50.04" data-timestamp="2810.04">One by one, the men take the stage, the head of the Chamber of Commerce, a state legislator, the president of one of the local hospitals, and the guy who owns the Goodyear Family Tire Center.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:47:00.25" data-timestamp="2820.25">So it truly is a very, very exciting time to be a small person in downtown Schenectady.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:47:04.64" data-timestamp="2824.64">The Guyanese seem to find all of this captivating. A few of them are taking notes, and everyone is alert and attentive. Ali explains to me later, they're immigrants. No official of the United States government has ever courted them like this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ali Latif</h4><p begin="00:47:19.82" data-timestamp="2839.82">They didn't welcome me in that way when I reached America in 1988. They didn't tell me anything about, I welcome you because you're a hard-working man, Guyanese people. But Schenectady actually, Schenectady is crying for help. And the only people who can put Schenectady back on its foot is the Guyanese people.</p><p begin="00:47:43.61" data-timestamp="2863.61">It's true. It's not false. They're hard-working, and they're going to make it if they're going to put back the city on its foot.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:48:00.52" data-timestamp="2880.52">Which brings us to Mayor Al, who orchestrated this whole morning to get them to see it this way. He's the last speaker. And when he comes on, more than anyone else, he treats the Guyanese like they're special. He solicits them in a way that seems more genuine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Al Jurczynski</h4><p begin="00:48:17.09" data-timestamp="2897.09">Just in a couple minutes, I just want to tell you, Schenectady is a beautiful city. and I'm going to pass some cards out, too. If you want to just take one and pass it around.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:48:28.81" data-timestamp="2908.81">He hands around a stack of his own business cards, which people seem a little shocked to be getting. And then, to make them feel welcome, he says in various ways, I am like you. He talks about his own immigrant roots, about how his grandparents came over from Poland, and about how his wife's parents moved to Schenectady from Italy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Al Jurczynski</h4><p begin="00:48:47.54" data-timestamp="2927.54">And there's a lot of similarities between Italians and Guyanese. They're very family-oriented. They're very ambitious. It's not uncommon for the Italians to work the way the Guyanese work.</p><p begin="00:49:05.61" data-timestamp="2945.61">I think you're a lot like Polish people, my family, in that you're very reserved. Italians like to argue. I know because my wife is Italian.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:49:21.62" data-timestamp="2961.62">The mayor's bus tour of town takes four hours. He shows us good neighborhoods and bad, the sewage treatment plant and the old GE plant. We even stop at his son's Little League picnic in the park for half an hour, because he promised his wife he'd drop by.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Al Jurczynski</h4><p begin="00:49:37.00" data-timestamp="2977">Hey, Tom. Hey, Tom.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:49:42.06" data-timestamp="2982.06">And he's constantly dragging the citizens of Schenectady onto the bus for testimonials. Tom is a city councilman who happened to be working in his front yard. We also meet Eddie, another city employee, and Jewel, the secretary to the former mayor. And around two hours into the tour, we're driving down a long, narrow street, when Mayor Al spots a Guyanese family outside a house. I can see the mayor just about restrain himself from pointing excitedly at them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Al Jurczynski</h4><p begin="00:50:12.85" data-timestamp="3012.85">Well, just tell everybody what you think of Schenectady.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:50:16.11" data-timestamp="3016.11">Very nice place to live.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:50:18.18" data-timestamp="3018.18">The last stop on the tour is the one that closes the deal for a lot of people. The mayor takes us to his wife's parents' house. Next to a small white ranch home is a huge vegetable garden, with the most beautiful vegetables I think I have ever seen in my life. It strikes a chord with everyone. The mayor's in-laws, an elderly Sicilian couple, make a point of greeting each people and shaking their hand.</p><p begin="00:50:41.06" data-timestamp="3041.06">[INTERPOSING VOICES]</p><p begin="00:50:46.17" data-timestamp="3046.17">They offer us all some homemade wine, and we're all goners, including Rohini and Gandhi Gopi, two New York City public school teachers who were skeptical after the morning presentation.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rohini Gopi</h4><p begin="00:50:56.67" data-timestamp="3056.67">When I see this, it reminds me of my own vegetable garden. And to my mind, this is the best part of the trip.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:51:04.45" data-timestamp="3064.45">So now, how are you feeling about Schenectady?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rohini Gopi</h4><p begin="00:51:06.24" data-timestamp="3066.24">More and more positive.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gandhi Gopi</h4><p begin="00:51:07.31" data-timestamp="3067.31">We want to get, we want to start making steps, if we could talk to somebody today about certain steps of making a move.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:51:20.49" data-timestamp="3080.49">We stand around in the driveway, drinking sweet white wine out of plastic cups. When I check in on Ali, he's unbuttoned the top button of his shirt and feeling a little tipsy, and making plans to buy a house plus an empty lot next door.</p><p begin="00:51:39.68" data-timestamp="3099.68">It's a month after the bus trip, and I'm back up in Schenectady. There's an old bar called Sark's in Hamilton Hill, which is the neighborhood that the mayor wants all the Guyanese to move to. You could say it's the worst neighborhood in the city, or you could say it's where the best house bargains are, depending on your point of view.</p><p begin="00:51:58.84" data-timestamp="3118.84">When you drive through it, it seems like a third of the houses are boarded up, a sketchy enough place that people in the bar are kind of surprised that I would be walking in there alone. I talk to a guy named Rod Smith. He's a carpenter, and he grew up here. And though he and his friends don't think much of the mayor, they like this one initiative. Nearly everyone I meet in Schenectady likes it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rod Smith</h4><p begin="00:52:21.71" data-timestamp="3141.71">Anything to upgrade this community would be 100%. Schenectady is in the dumper right now. I can't make from my car to my front door, which is 15 feet away, without somebody trying to sell me something. I have people running up and down in front of my windows all night long, selling drugs and other things.</p><p begin="00:52:49.98" data-timestamp="3169.98">I got a guy standing outside of my front door, trying to sell drugs. And he thinks that I'm pulling over to buy something from him. And I said "I live here. Get away from my front door." Next thing I know, they're going to be coming through it. I don't want that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:53:12.35" data-timestamp="3192.35">All the Guyanese believe it's safer in Schenectady than in New York City. But they're moving to the worst neighborhood in town, and the crime stats aren't encouraging. In the year 2000, Schenectady county had half the violent crimes per capita than Queens county had. But there were so many property crimes that overall, Schenectady had much higher crime rates per capita than Queens.</p><p begin="00:53:37.16" data-timestamp="3217.16">Not that this makes much difference to the Guyanese I talk to. Whenever I ask them about the difficulties of moving, how dangerous the neighborhood is, the availability of jobs, the fact that Schenectady gets 60 inches of snow a year, so they're not going to actually get that much time in their gardens, they shrug it off. They say what I imagine immigrants to this city have always said. They say they're ready to sacrifice, which is one reason the mayor's pitch seems to work so well.</p><p begin="00:54:05.73" data-timestamp="3245.73">He doesn't tell them it's going to be easy in Schenectady. He makes it clear it's going to be hard, and they're going to have to work hard. And they all tell me, that's exactly what they're prepared to do.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ali Latif</h4><p begin="00:54:20.55" data-timestamp="3260.55">This house, look at it. The driveway is very wide. Right? It's very spacious, wide. It's not choked up--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:54:30.31" data-timestamp="3270.31">When I catch up with Ali, he shows me a Polaroid of the yellow house he now owns in Schenectady. Two weeks after our bus trip, he took another day off from work, bought a $70 bus ticket, and went up to see some houses. He liked this one immediately. He didn't have the place inspected or do any more research about Schenectady or the neighborhood. And compared to prices in New York City, it was a steal. He paid $55,000, all cash.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ali Latif</h4><p begin="00:54:57.22" data-timestamp="3297.22">The house is profit, because people--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:54:59.67" data-timestamp="3299.67">It's a two-family house, and there are two tenants in the building. The tenants are section eight, which means that the government pays a large portion of the rent. He'll rent it out for two years, and then he'll move to Schenectady to retire. He's put his faith and his life savings into this plan. And it was all because of the mayor, he tells me, the way the mayor treated him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ali Latif</h4><p begin="00:55:21.28" data-timestamp="3321.28">I think one, why I'm going to live here, I can approach him. That's a most important factor. I can't go approach Mr. Bush and Rudy Giuliani and the governor.</p><p begin="00:55:35.16" data-timestamp="3335.16">I can't well meet them. It's hard to reach them. But I can reach, if I live in Schenectady, I could go and reach the mayor. And I am sure they would listen to me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Al Jurczynski</h4><p begin="00:55:48.79" data-timestamp="3348.79">These are people that are from Guyana originally--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:55:52.68" data-timestamp="3352.68">Again, Mayor Al.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Al Jurczynski</h4><p begin="00:55:54.63" data-timestamp="3354.63">--but for the last 10 or 15 years, have been in New York City. And in New York City, they revere the office of mayor. The mayor of New York City is an international figure. So when they come here, oftentimes they'll say, "I've never shaken the hand of a mayor before." And I go along with that. I let them think that I'm bigger than life.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:56:33.27" data-timestamp="3393.27">He says this is completely different from the way his regular constituents greet him. It's a hard, blue-collar city, he says. The old residents don't put the mayor up on a pedestal. Only the new residents do that, which is a mixed blessing for him, since he's not the sort of person who feels very comfortable on a pedestal.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:57.24" data-timestamp="3417.24">Wendy Dorr. As best as anybody knows, there were about 1,000 Guyanese in Schenectady before the mayor started his initiative in May. And according to mortgage brokers, perhaps 200 families, maybe 1,000 people have moved since then. The mayor's goal is to triple the Guyanese community to 3,000 people by the end of the year. His long-term goal is a little more ambitious, 35,000 people by the end of three years, a huge increase for a city of 60,000. So far it's a small enough change that everybody that Wendy talked to in Schenectady, even in the neighborhood that is most affected, told her they did not notice a change yet.</p><p begin="00:57:30.93" data-timestamp="3450.93">[MUSIC PLAYING - "MOSES SUPPOSES" BY GENE KELLY AND DONALD O'CONNOR]</p></div>  </div>
