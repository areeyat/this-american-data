  <h3>Prologue</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.62" data-timestamp="0.62">From WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio International, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>. I'm Ira Glass. Today on our program, the story of two Americans who went to South Africa. One's white, one's black. And they went there because there's something about South Africa for them and for many Americans, something familiar and unfamiliar at the same time in a way that makes it mesmerizing.</p><p begin="00:00:22.01" data-timestamp="22.01">Robert Kennedy described this congruence of nations as well as anybody. In 1966, he was visiting South Africa. And he began a speech at the University of Cape Town this way--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Kennedy</h4><p begin="00:00:31.64" data-timestamp="31.64">I come here because of my deep interest and affection for a land settled by the Dutch in the mid-17th century, then taken over by the British, and at last independent. A land in which the native inhabitants were at first subdued, but relations with whom remain a problem to this day. A land which was once the importer of slaves and now must struggle to wipe out the last traces of that former bondage. I refer, of course, to the United States of America.</p><p begin="00:01:15.42" data-timestamp="75.42">[APPLAUSE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:20.17" data-timestamp="80.17">That stunned pause before the audience begins applauding, I think that's so beautiful. More than England or France or Israel, more than Canada or Japan, when we think of South Africa, it is a more interesting mirror of the United States than nearly any country. I think because we glimpse a distant echo of the most frightening parts of our own country and the most inspiring parts.</p><p begin="00:01:55.40" data-timestamp="115.4">In the 1950s and '60s, black South Africans looked to the US for inspiration. Lewis Nkosi lived in Sophiatown. He remembers reading American literature like Langston Hughes' <i>Simple</i> <i>Speaks</i> <i>His</i> <i>Mind.</i></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lewis Nkosi</h4><p begin="00:02:06.69" data-timestamp="126.69">We used to laugh so much about what he was saying, because it sounded to us like this was Johannesburg. And listening to the music, the films like <i>Stormy</i> <i>Weather</i> were just speaking for us.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:30.21" data-timestamp="150.21">&quot;Harlem was like our neighborhood,&quot; Lewis Nkosi says. Black South Africans in Sophiatown listened to Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker and Miles Davis, tried to dress and talk like Lena Horne and Cab Calloway. In Sophiatown, gang members modeled themselves after Hollywood movies, dressed in zoot suits, picked up phrases from tough guy films like <i>Street</i> <i>with</i> <i>No</i> <i>Name.</i></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lewis Nkosi</h4><p begin="00:02:49.06" data-timestamp="169.06">We wanted to sound like Americans, to relate to American culture. And we wanted also to fantasize about being black Americans rather than black South Africans, because the intensification of suffering in South Africa was just too great. America, it was a country where you have Thurgood Marshall working to eliminate a lot of the civil rights abuses and getting schools integrated and so on. So you know, this was a movement in the opposite direction to where we were moving.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Kennedy</h4><p begin="00:03:43.01" data-timestamp="223.01">Nations, like men, often march to the beat of different drummers. And the precise solutions of the United States can neither be dictated nor transplanted to others. What is important, however, is that all nations must march toward increasing freedom, toward justice for all. You must do this not because it is economically advantageous, although it is, not because the laws of God commanded, although they do, we must do it for the single and fundamental reason that it is the right thing to do.</p><p begin="00:04:23.79" data-timestamp="263.79">[APPLAUSE]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lewis Nkosi</h4><p begin="00:04:26.88" data-timestamp="266.88">And looking to America as a land of hope, this is a cliche now. But we really did believe that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:41.87" data-timestamp="281.87">Now, of course, the situation is reversed. Once Nelson Mandela got out of prison, and especially after he entered the president's office, it's been black Americans who look to South Africa for inspiration. A few years ago, I did a series of stories for National Public Radio with a South African reporter, comparing race relations in the US with race relations in South Africa. And one of the most striking differences between the way that blacks in the two countries saw things was blacks in South Africa, they said they had hope.</p><p begin="00:05:16.40" data-timestamp="316.4">Of course, it isn't just black Americans who look to South Africa to see a place where things are changing, where things are getting better in small ways. Today, we've devoted our entire program to the story of two guys who look to South Africa that way. Their names are Josh Seftel and Rich Robinson. Both of them grew up in the normal morass of post-civil rights race relations in this country, went to schools that were integrated but where blacks and whites usually stayed separate, rarely mixed.</p><p begin="00:05:42.01" data-timestamp="342.01">So they headed to the new South Africa for a few weeks. And it turns out they did not agree on what they saw there. What we bring you today is partly a story of the emerging multiracial society over there and partly a story about the one here at home to contemplate this 4th of July weekend. Rich starts our story.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One: Act One</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Rich Robinson</h4><p begin="00:06:01.27" data-timestamp="361.27">It was my idea to go to South Africa. I'd met this South African guy at work. He told me that South Africa is the most beautiful country in the world and that everything you see on TV about it is wrong. I asked Josh to go with me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:06:13.83" data-timestamp="373.83">I had another reason for wanting to visit South Africa. I had just gotten a letter from some South African guy named Benzion Seftel asking if we might be related. My family's very small. Besides my parents and two sisters, there's only a few Seftels in all of North America. I guess I was simultaneously excited and scared. I mean, it's not every day that the size of your family suddenly doubles.</p><p begin="00:06:37.19" data-timestamp="397.19">But when they're white South Africans, all these questions pop into your head, the first and most obvious question being, &quot;So do they hate black people?&quot; I mean, what do you do when your family doubles in size but the new half is a bunch of white supremacists? I decided not to share any of these worries with Rich.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rich Robinson</h4><p begin="00:07:02.72" data-timestamp="422.72">Josh and I met 10 years ago in college. We ended up living in the same house, and we've lived together off and on since then. Josh is the son of a Jewish doctor in the suburbs. I grew up in the city. My parents are public high school teachers. He's white, I'm black, but none of this has ever been an issue. Before this trip, I don't think we ever had one serious talk about race.</p><p begin="00:07:22.90" data-timestamp="442.9">We both wanted to see the new South Africa, to see how much the country had changed since Nelson Mandela took power two years ago. We decided to begin our search in a neighborhood called Yeoville. The free magazine they give you on the plane had an article about it. Lots of glossy pictures of blacks and whites laughing together in the streets, drinking together in bars and clubs, eating together in restaurants.</p><p begin="00:07:43.23" data-timestamp="463.23">[CLUB MUSIC]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:07:48.65" data-timestamp="468.65">Yeoville's a party. The street is lined with outdoor cafes, people are wearing Nike T-shirts, New York Yankees hats, all kinds of American stuff. The scene is just like the magazine pictures. Blacks and whites talk together and drive by us in BMWs and Mercedes. When Rich and I go into a convenience store to get a drink, there's a tall black man wearing a Public Enemy T-shirt in the corner. He's playing Pac-Man.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yeoville Man</h4><p begin="00:08:11.69" data-timestamp="491.69">I tell you, things are going properly. We are just mixing up. Like, I'm talking to you guys. I think you are colored, yeah? You are colored?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rich Robinson</h4><p begin="00:08:20.33" data-timestamp="500.33">We call it &quot;black&quot; in America.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yeoville Man</h4><p begin="00:08:21.58" data-timestamp="501.58">Is it? OK, that's black. And you're &quot;white,&quot; right?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:08:24.01" data-timestamp="504.01">I'm white.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yeoville Man</h4><p begin="00:08:24.52" data-timestamp="504.52">Yeah, sure, sure, sure. That's OK. I mean, that is positive. You can look like my woman. She has [? got a ?] white too, man.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:08:33.02" data-timestamp="513.02">Standing over by the pay phone, his girlfriend was plump and rosy in an African print jumpsuit and a red cashmere Kangol beret.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yeoville Man</h4><p begin="00:08:40.13" data-timestamp="520.13">She's not from around here, but still, I've got here my woman, my white woman. Lovely. I love her to the maximum, I'll tell you that. But it's like, anyway--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:08:50.42" data-timestamp="530.42">Do think that Yeoville is maybe one of the best places right now because it's mixed?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yeoville Man</h4><p begin="00:08:55.85" data-timestamp="535.85">In South Africa?</p><p begin="00:08:56.86" data-timestamp="536.86">[BEEPING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yeoville Man</h4><p begin="00:08:57.48" data-timestamp="537.48">Sure. Sure.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:08:58.65" data-timestamp="538.65">What's that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yeoville Man</h4><p begin="00:08:59.70" data-timestamp="539.7">That's the pager, my man.

She just went to the phone call and paged me, and it's like, hey, beeping! She's-- anyway, guys, hey.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:09:16.74" data-timestamp="556.74">What's your girlfriend's name?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yeoville Man</h4><p begin="00:09:18.44" data-timestamp="558.44">Mary.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:09:19.06" data-timestamp="559.06">Mary. If you came into this store five years ago with Mary-- a white woman, black man-- what would have happened?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yeoville Man</h4><p begin="00:09:23.92" data-timestamp="563.92">I would have been dead eight years ago.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:09:26.82" data-timestamp="566.82">You would have been dead eight years ago?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yeoville Man</h4><p begin="00:09:28.09" data-timestamp="568.09">That's true.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:09:29.50" data-timestamp="569.5">Why? What would have happened?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yeoville Man</h4><p begin="00:09:30.56" data-timestamp="570.56">Yeah. Because I would have been killed by my own brothers because they were fighting against the white people. And if they would have seen me with a white woman, that's the end.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rich Robinson</h4><p begin="00:09:50.75" data-timestamp="590.75">It was our first day in South Africa, and it seemed like everything you'd want it to be, everything you'd dreamed of for the new multiracial society. Blacks and whites together, Pac-man, and personal pagers. We went to the Pita Palace for a celebratory souvlaki, and there, our celebration was cut short.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dimitri</h4><p begin="00:10:07.47" data-timestamp="607.47">I'm now 21 years old, right? And what I did was I decided that I have to leave this country.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:10:15.71" data-timestamp="615.71">Dimitri, the owner of the Pita Palace.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dimitri</h4><p begin="00:10:18.31" data-timestamp="618.31">I can't raise my children here. There's too much crime. And they'll just break into your house, take your stuff, and go. They come into your house, they break in, they rape your wife, they shoot you, and totally destroy your life. Kind of like the black people are taking revenge on the whites for apartheid, you know? Someone got around and said, &quot;Oh, let's drive them out of the country.&quot; And it's working, because every single year, the emigrations are going up.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:10:49.92" data-timestamp="649.92">A lot of white people are leaving?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dimitri</h4><p begin="00:10:52.04" data-timestamp="652.04">Yeah.

I know of hundreds of families that have emigrated this year.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:10:59.13" data-timestamp="659.13">You're going to leave soon?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dimitri</h4><p begin="00:11:00.79" data-timestamp="660.79">As soon as I can, yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:11:02.69" data-timestamp="662.69">Over the next few days, we would hear Dimitri's story over and over. Wherever we went, people talked about crime and fear and whites leaving. That night when we walked home through the dark streets of Johannesburg, we found a shiny bullet shell on the pavement. We took a cab the rest of the way home.</p><p begin="00:11:19.08" data-timestamp="679.08">[RUNNING WATER]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rich Robinson</h4><p begin="00:11:22.38" data-timestamp="682.38">You excited?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:11:24.27" data-timestamp="684.27">About what?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rich Robinson</h4><p begin="00:11:25.57" data-timestamp="685.57">What are you doing today?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:11:27.63" data-timestamp="687.63">Going to see--</p><p begin="00:11:28.64" data-timestamp="688.64">[ELECTRIC RAZOR]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:11:29.11" data-timestamp="689.11">--the people that I think are my relatives.

And we've got many stories. Well, I suppose Harold told you-- I don't want to go over it-- his association with Mandela. Did he tell you?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:12:49.82" data-timestamp="769.82">So here we are with my long-lost family. Sitting around a big table piled with lasagna and fresh baked bread, are Harold Seftel, his sisters Dolly and Molly Seftel, Dolly's son Louis, and Rich and I. They reminded me of my relatives back is Schenectady.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rich Robinson</h4><p begin="00:13:06.08" data-timestamp="786.08">Josh looks a lot like Louis. It was easy to believe they were related. Nevertheless, we spent several long hours around dinner trying to prove it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:13:12.97" data-timestamp="792.97">Now, Uncle Borach is which person here?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dolly Seftel</h4><p begin="00:13:15.80" data-timestamp="795.8">Now, that's my father Louie.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:13:19.55" data-timestamp="799.55">That's Louie, the little boy in the picture?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dolly Seftel</h4><p begin="00:13:21.32" data-timestamp="801.32">That's right.

It's black and white, ragged at the edges, with a neatly posed family. The father in this picture had a thick, white beard, heavy eyelids, and a black-brimmed hat. He was probably my great uncle.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dolly Seftel</h4><p begin="00:13:42.62" data-timestamp="822.62">Yes, well, he was very smart. Apparently, he was a ladies' man.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:13:46.09" data-timestamp="826.09">Oh, really?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dolly Seftel</h4><p begin="00:13:46.58" data-timestamp="826.58">Yes. He had lots of ladies. In fact--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:13:50.56" data-timestamp="830.56">There's something about meeting distant relatives so far from home. There's this immediate bond that's basic and powerful, this feeling like you're all players on the same team, even though you've just met. But at the same time, mainly because Rich was there with me, I was nervous and wanted to know what the people around the dinner table had done during apartheid.</p><p begin="00:14:10.66" data-timestamp="850.66">It's embarrassing to think about now, but I asked them repeatedly to talk about those years. At first, they were reluctant to discuss it, but finally they did. I was relieved to find out that Harold, a tall, lean, 60-year-old with squinty eyes, not only knows Nelson Mandela, he's one of his doctors. After Mandela came out of prison, he invited Harold and his kids for lunch. During apartheid, Molly was active in a group called The Black Sash, which picketed outside the court buildings.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Harold Seftel</h4><p begin="00:14:38.82" data-timestamp="878.82">At the end of the day, what did we do? I mean, it's not that we rioted in the streets or that we--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dolly Seftel</h4><p begin="00:14:43.29" data-timestamp="883.29">But I mean, look at you. You only worked in black hospitals, you wouldn't--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Harold Seftel</h4><p begin="00:14:48.52" data-timestamp="888.52">I would not-- I worked in a black hospital. And look, I suppose I did a little bit of good--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dolly Seftel</h4><p begin="00:14:52.79" data-timestamp="892.79">I mean, you changed the attitude of students towards black people. And he was--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Harold Seftel</h4><p begin="00:14:57.04" data-timestamp="897.04">But I can't really describe myself as an activist. Let's be honest.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dolly Seftel</h4><p begin="00:14:59.99" data-timestamp="899.99">Yeah, but your daughter was an activist.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Harold Seftel</h4><p begin="00:15:01.82" data-timestamp="901.82">Yes, but my children. I think I would say my children.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:15:04.59" data-timestamp="904.59">It turns out, Harold's son David used to drive around giving medical care to black activists who were too scared to go into the state hospitals. Harold's daughter Lisa is a member of Mandela's party, the ANC. She was arrested and imprisoned for several months during the struggle and had to go into hiding underground for years. For a while, Lisa's Aunt Dolly and Dolly's son Louis, who are less political, let her stay at their house.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dolly Seftel</h4><p begin="00:15:28.90" data-timestamp="928.9">Yes, '86, when we went to Israel, that's when she stayed and moved in here with the ANC.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Louis Seftel</h4><p begin="00:15:35.80" data-timestamp="935.8">That's a great story. During that year, because she needed a place to hide, we said that she could stay here and she could run whatever she wants to here. Because it was safe, it was suburbia, it wasn't where the activists hang out in Yeoville. So this was a great cover for her. So she stretched out and she spread out by the pool. All the ANC communists just laid out by the pool.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Molly Seftel</h4><p begin="00:16:03.98" data-timestamp="963.98">We don't know that, Louis.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Louis Seftel</h4><p begin="00:16:05.43" data-timestamp="965.43">We know from Joseph, our servant. He's from Malau. He has worked for us for 35 years. And Joseph would tell us that every day he would cook for them. And he would bring them meals. And he would serve them as they were writing their newsletters and their propaganda.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:16:23.04" data-timestamp="983.04">Even though Louis seemed to have some problems with the ANC, Harold knew Mandela, Lisa was in the ANC, Molly was protesting in the streets. As far as I was concerned, my family passed the test. My fear that they would be a bunch of white supremacists was put to rest and I felt relieved.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rich Robinson</h4><p begin="00:16:40.41" data-timestamp="1000.41">I felt uncomfortable.

First of all, we're one of the few white families that's got a black child in the family. I mean, I'm the aunt of this-- and not many Jewish families have got black children. In fact, I don't think there are any other Jewish families. And there's one family, but they adopted the black child.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rich Robinson</h4><p begin="00:17:07.45" data-timestamp="1027.45">It was just one of those situations where you never forget you're the only black person in the room. After eating, Louis took us on a short tour of their estate. We saw their expensive bedrooms, pools, Jacuzzis, and finally, tucked around the back of the house, was the servants' quarters, which consisted of a tiny main room with four beds and a closet-sized bathroom. One worker was in the room at the time watching a dim black-and-white TV. Beside his head on the wall was a photocopy of a game board.</p><p begin="00:17:33.93" data-timestamp="1053.93">Louis told us that this was a lottery game. If you picked the right square, you won the pot for that week. I asked him who played. He pointed to the servant and said in a patronizing tone, that all of &quot;them&quot; do. The servant shook his head to say that he did not play, but Louis repeated that &quot;all blacks played.&quot;</p><p begin="00:17:49.52" data-timestamp="1069.52">Later, there was this awkward moment-- awkward for me, anyway-- when Dolly and Louis were talking about Harold's daughter, Lisa.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dolly Seftel</h4><p begin="00:17:55.66" data-timestamp="1075.66">Her main boyfriends were black.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Louis Seftel</h4><p begin="00:17:59.37" data-timestamp="1079.37">But she would always say that the blacks in the ANC were always--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dolly Seftel</h4><p begin="00:18:02.11" data-timestamp="1082.11">But that was the-- often you won't find, she doesn't criticize much, but she did say that the blacks, the boyfriends were not faithful. They had lots of women. And even the man that she's had the baby with, he's got a child. But I hope that he's faithful to her.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rich Robinson</h4><p begin="00:18:22.28" data-timestamp="1102.28">Well, I don't know how she meant it, but that sweeping statement about what all blacks are like, all blacks are unfaithful, that did it for me.

I'm serious. I did not go in there not wanting to like them. But I definitely felt tense. And I didn't know why I felt tense. And I started to feel bad, and I started not wanting to be there. You missed it, though. When you left the room and it was just all of us in the room, we had nothing to talk about. They didn't want to talk to me at all. I mean, there was noticeable silence, and there was nothing going on.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:19:39.42" data-timestamp="1179.42">You honestly believe that most white South African families are more liberal or as liberal as them?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rich Robinson</h4><p begin="00:19:45.66" data-timestamp="1185.66">No!

But almost every house was surrounded by a high fence and barbed wire. One neighborhood had a manned checkpoint to keep people out who didn't belong. Another had armed security guards patrolling the tree-lined streets on bicycle. We drove past an area that looked like a golf course with a neatly manicured lawn. And right by the curb, half-hidden by the shrubbery, were maybe half a dozen black people, sitting and laying on the ground.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Molly Seftel</h4><p begin="00:22:00.16" data-timestamp="1320.16">In this bush here, the people squat.

You don't give him anything!&quot; So I had just baked  some bread, I made sandwiches. And I said, &quot;Louise, I'm warning you. You'll find your mother dead.&quot;</p><p begin="00:22:55.17" data-timestamp="1375.17">But she went on, and she put lettuce and tomatoes and cheese.

The next day they were ringing again.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:23:19.35" data-timestamp="1399.35">We were back at her house.

Since 1994, the murder has actually dropped 14%. Car thefts have dropped. Home burglaries have increased only 11%. The biggest increase in crime is non-residential robberies, which is up 50%, and rape, which is up 36%. What's happening is that crime in the white areas is now becoming the same as it's always been in the black townships.</p><p begin="00:24:21.77" data-timestamp="1461.77">Josh and I weren't getting along so well since the fight in the hotel room. In the 10 years we have known each other, we had never really fought before.

We drove for hours over green, rolling hills. The deeper we got into the country, the fewer and fewer white faces we saw. Every so often, we'd see a cluster of pink and aquamarine huts on a hillside, a village. Finally, we stopped at one.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rich Robinson</h4><p begin="00:24:59.21" data-timestamp="1499.21">There's a group of guys about our age sitting in an old car seat next to one of the huts.

Why not water first? Why didn't they ask us &quot;What thing do you want first?&quot; Are we going to eat electricity? Are we going to drink electricity? Where are we going to get money to buy this electricity if we are not employed?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rich Robinson</h4><p begin="00:25:45.10" data-timestamp="1545.1">They invited us into their shebeen for beers. They asked us questions about America, about our girlfriends, about the federal system, how we liked people at the office. They told us a story about why black men's noses are flat and white men's noses are long. They asked me if I was a relative of Michael Jackson. And they complained about the new South Africa.

They were still without water and work, and they still felt powerless. Apartheid had done more than just separate the races. It had created a lasting sense of black inferiority.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Wayne</h4><p begin="00:27:22.20" data-timestamp="1642.2">The blacks, if they see a small boy of white meat, they think that small boy of white meat is-- I forgot-- is bigger than them.

And then the girl with face paint turned and looked us over. She looked at Rich's skin, which was a few shades later than her own. Then see looked at mine, which was a few shades lighter still.

But in South Africa, white oppression officially just ended two years ago. I came here thinking it would be like seeing what it was like during the bus boycotts in the '60s or during the Civil War.

It said that Rustler's was one of the most progressive places in the country, maybe on the continent, a kind of ongoing South African Woodstock. When we got there, there were lots of hippie-looking people with long beards, toting aboriginal instruments and bongos. The horticulture there looked like something out of a Dr. Seuss book. On one hillside, it looked like someone was holding a VW van convention. On another hillside, we joined a group of people who were in the middle of experiencing &quot;a sound journey.&quot;</p><p begin="00:32:52.70" data-timestamp="1972.7">They all sat in a circle with their eyes closed and their legs crossed. In the middle of the circle was a man with a bunch of instruments. He was blowing on a didgeridoo. When he stopped, they went around the circle talking about how the sound journey had made them feel.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 1</h4><p begin="00:33:07.02" data-timestamp="1987.02">It was an amazing experience. I actually still feel quite out of my body, really. And thank you for creating the space to help me let go.

There were people swimming naked and horses drinking from water and running wild. A group of two women and two men were passing around reefers the size of small cigars. But most of the action at Rustler's took place around a giant, flaming globe. At night, hundreds of kids danced to techno music in the firelight. Next to the dance floor was a pool where nude swimming was encouraged. There was a room called The Passion Pit, with low couches, dim lighting, and intertwined bodies. There was the tepee village. Rich and I went down there and ran into this guy wearing moccasins, knickers, and a feather headdress. He rolled a joint and talked to us about Rustler's philosophy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:34:18.14" data-timestamp="2058.14">I very much believe that psychedelics have been around since the beginning of time. They've aided in man's evolution. And I think they can take us towards the future, certainly in dissolving personal boundaries and ideals of who we are and what we are and who we are about. So smoke a lot of dope.</p><p begin="00:34:42.23" data-timestamp="2082.23">A lot of people in our government are smokers. They were left-wing revolutionaries and radicals. I've personally had conversations with this deputy staff president about hemp and the role it will play in regenerating rural economies.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rich Robinson</h4><p begin="00:35:03.61" data-timestamp="2103.61">We had somehow wandered into a techno version of America in the '60s. But if America's '60s were about rebellion, it wasn't clear from anyone we talked to who or what, exactly, Rustler's meant to be rebelling against. In the smoky bar near the dance floor, we met the founder of Rustler's. He's 40-something with a pony tail, beard, and an African wrap that covered his hairy legs to the knees. His name was Frick. He explained the enemy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Frick</h4><p begin="00:35:28.74" data-timestamp="2128.74">You see, the power structure that we're rebelling against is the American government. We see them misleading the whole world down a corporate dead end into neomodernism. They're leaving no space for society to develop. We believe we need to return to Shamanism or return to magic or return to values of the earth, an understanding that was held by most ethnic people. So we see our source of inspiration as being the ethnic peoples that the corporate world hasn't yet [BLEEP] up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rich Robinson</h4><p begin="00:36:00.86" data-timestamp="2160.86">So the American government was the enemy, and the solution was the ethnic peoples. The only problem was, there were no ethnic peoples there. In a country made up of Zulus, Ndebele, Sotho, and Xhosa, a country with 12 official native languages, besides the kitchen workers and occasional gardener, I was the only black person at Rustler's. Josh and I did a little informal survey. Why no black people?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rustler's Valley Resident 1</h4><p begin="00:36:24.75" data-timestamp="2184.75">It's anyone.

It was more like a theme park for recreational drug users, a summer camp escape for young, white South Africans where they didn't have to think about the crime rates or the futures in this country. After two hazy days, when we finally got back into our room, we found a young, blond-haired woman sprawled across one of our beds rolling a joint in the bedspread. It was 5:00 in the morning. We'd had enough. We asked her to leave.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:37:42.08" data-timestamp="2262.08">Back in the States, I almost never notice race.

I walked in the main room. They had a couple people behind the desk. And two or three people were hanging out. And they were having at least two conversations, possibly three. You know, different groups of people. Not many people, six to eight people. And I walked in the room, closed the door, and everyone's quiet. Literally, I mean, come on. Two or three conversations didn't just happen to end  at right the exact same moment I walked in the door. But you know, I open my mouth, I say a couple words, I make a joke, and it lightens everything up for them, and they feel, &quot;OK, that's all right. That's cool.&quot;</p><p begin="00:38:46.67" data-timestamp="2326.67">But I only am able to do that because I know that if I prove to them that I'm from out of the country, then they'll feel comfortable again, like they're not having-- like, it's something that they can feel cool about.

She didn't seem to notice. As we were driving out of Rustler's, someone approached the car and gave us a bulging sandwich bag full of marijuana and a bumper sticker.

But now that I had seen more of the country, I didn't feel that way anymore.

And I was screaming. I mean, I had every sound coming from me. I don't know where it came from.</p><p begin="00:51:20.23" data-timestamp="3080.23">And they must have been doing this for about three minutes, when coming towards us was an elderly white couple. They must have been in their '70s. And the man pulled out a gun, and he shot the one on this side of me. And I said, &quot;And him too! Him too!&quot;</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Josh Seftel</h4><p begin="00:51:38.77" data-timestamp="3098.77">Not long ago, Molly had been famous and powerful. She was an actress who had been in lots of plays and a few films. She was the first white actress to appear on stage with a black. Her husband Monty had been a politician and had served as the mayor of Johannesburg during the '70s. But he died a few months before we arrived. Now she lived by herself in a big house with a big wall surrounding it. She was alone, except for her black servants.</p><p begin="00:52:03.78" data-timestamp="3123.78">One of the turning points in her life as a South African, one of the moments that changed her from an activist into the person she's become, was the day that the Seftels had waited for for years, the day Nelson Mandela was released from prison. The day started off just fine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Molly Seftel</h4><p begin="00:52:18.92" data-timestamp="3138.92">Well, it was total euphoria.

And in the meantime, in the-- and it got hot as Hades. My friend who was with me, she was punched in the stomach and her camera was stolen. It was an enormous crowd of people. And they were crushing you and crushing-- eventually, you didn't have any space to breathe. And we must have been there for about six hours when we decided we must get out of here, because we began to fear for our safety. It was that sort of encroachment on our territory. And this is what's happening now.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rich Robinson</h4><p begin="00:53:04.47" data-timestamp="3184.47">The new South Africa wasn't working out the way they expected.
