And to tell that story, I'm joined here in the studio by NPR science reporters Alix Spiegel and Lulu Miller. Hey there, guys.Lulu MillerHi.Alix SpiegelHello.Ira GlassAnd do I have this right? So you bought a rat, and you brought it to NPR headquarters in Washington, DC?Alix SpiegelWe did.Lulu MillerAlix bought the rat.Alix SpiegelI did.Ira GlassAnd where at NPR did you bring the rat to?Alix SpiegelWe ferreted it into a little kind of edit booth type thing--[GIGGLING]Lulu MillerHi, buddy!Alix Spiegel--type office. And we invited people into the room one by one.Lulu MillerSo can you just describe what we got here?Male Speaker 1It's a rat.Female Speaker 1Pinkish ears.Male Speaker 2Red eyes.Male Speaker 3Long nose.Alix SpiegelAnd sat them down in front of this rat and asked this question.Lulu MillerDo you think that the thoughts that you have in your head-- OK, the private thoughts that you have in your head-- could influence how that rat moves through space?Male Speaker 1No.Female Speaker 1No.Male Speaker 2No.Male Speaker 3No.Alix SpiegelAnd it was almost unanimous. People did not believe that their personal thoughts would have any effect on the rat at all.Male Speaker 4Because that would suggest some sort of telepathy which I don't have.Alix SpiegelAnd Ira, maybe that's what you think too.Ira GlassThat is what I think. I don't think that people thinking thoughts will affect a rat's behavior.Alix SpiegelWell, you're wrong.Ira GlassNo.Bob Rosenthal(CHUCKLING) Yes.Ira GlassOK, so who's this?Alix SpiegelThis is a man named Bob Rosenthal. He's a research psychologist. And early in his career, he did this thing. He went into his lab late at night and hung signs on all of the rat cages. And some of the signs said that the rat in the cage was incredibly smart. And some of the signs said that the rat in the cage was incredibly dumb, even though neither of those things was true.Bob RosenthalThey were very average rats that you would buy from a research institute that sells rats for a living.Alix SpiegelSo then Bob brings this group of experimenters into his lab, and he says, for the next week, some of you are going to get these incredibly smart rats. And some of you are going to get these incredibly stupid rats. And your job is to run your rat through a maze and record how well it does.Lulu MillerCan you just pick up the rat?Alix SpiegelSo, Ira, we actually did a very lo-fi, unscientific version of this in that little room in NPR.Ira GlassThey let you do that?Alix SpiegelWe didn't ask permission.Male Speaker 4Is that OK to do?Lulu MillerYeah.Alix SpiegelYeah.Lulu MillerAnd you've probably already guessed where this is going.Alix SpiegelYeah. In Bob's real study, the experimenters ran the rats that they had been told were smart.Female Speaker 1She has sort of an intelligent looking face.Alix SpiegelAnd the rats they had been told were dumb.Male Speaker 4Yeah, he seems kind of lazy.Alix SpiegelIt was not even close.Bob RosenthalThe results were so dramatic.Alix SpiegelIn Bob's real study, the smart rats did almost twice as well as the dumb rats.Ira GlassWait, even though they were the same?Alix SpiegelYeah, even though the smart rats were not smart and the dumb rats were not dumb. They were all just the same average kind of lab rat. It was so shocking, people didn't really believe him.Bob RosenthalI was having trouble publishing any of this.Ira GlassAnd so what was going on? Like, what was actually happening to make the rats do this?Alix SpiegelSo what Bob figured out was that the expectations that the experimenters carried in their heads subtly changed the way that the experimenters touched the rats, and that changed the way that the rats behaved. So when the experimenters thought that the rats were really smart, they felt more warmly towards the rats. And so they touched them more gently.Bob RosenthalWe do know that handling rats and handling them more gently can actually increase the performance of rats.Ira GlassAnd how does this play out when it comes to people? How do our expectations of other people work?Alix SpiegelWell, what you saw in the rats totally holds for people too. I talked to Carol Dweck, who's a psychologist and researcher at Stanford.Carol DweckYou may be standing farther away from someone you have lower expectations for. You may not be making as much eye contact. And it's not something you can put your finger on. We are not usually aware of how we are conveying our expectations to other people. But it's there.Alix SpiegelAnd it happens in all kinds of areas. Research has shown that a teacher's expectations can raise or lower a student's IQ score, that a mother's expectations influences the drinking behavior of her middle schooler, that military trainers' expectations can literally make a soldier run faster or slower. So my question was-- you know, how far does this go?Alix SpiegelSo Carol, clearly these expectation effects exist on a continuum. So for example, if I expect that if somebody jumps off a building, they will be able to fly, that's not going to work out so well, right?Carol DweckMm-hmm.Alix SpiegelSo what does science know about where we should draw the line? Does it have a clear sense of that?Carol DweckNo. That line is moving. As we come to understand things that are possible and mechanisms through which a belief affects an outcome or one person affects another person, that line can move.Ira GlassWell, from WBEZ, Chicago, it'sThisAmericanLife. Today on our program, we have a kind of hard to believe example of what expectations can do to people. This story is from a new radio show and podcast that Alix and Lulu are launching this week. It's calledInvisibilia. It's about the invisible forces that shape human behavior, like beliefs and assumptions and emotions, which I know sounds a little abstract. But in execution, I have to say it is anything but.Act One: Batman BeginsIra GlassAlix used to work here at our program. Lulu worked atRadiolab, and their new show is sort of halfway between the two. A quick heads-up before they launch into this. As you may have noticed, their voices sound a lot alike.Lulu MillerThey are.Alix SpiegelSorry. Yeah.Ira GlassYes, I know that is not news to the two of you at all. So stay with us. And Lulu, let's just jump right in. Where do you want to start?Lulu MillerWell, I'll start with a question that I asked the rat scientist, the expectations guy, Bob Rosenthal.Bob RosenthalOK.Lulu MillerCould my expectations make a blind person who literally has no eyeballs see?Bob RosenthalNo way. The expectations will not make him see.Lulu MillerHow sure are you about that one?Bob RosenthalPositive.Lulu MillerSo I'm deep in the woods of Southern California with a man named Daniel Kish. We've been hiking for hours, climbing over tree stumps and along the edges of a steep ravine. And we're just sitting down in the dirt to take a break.Lulu MillerCould we look at your eyes?Daniel KishIn terms of them being out?Lulu MillerYeah.Daniel KishYeah.Lulu MillerAnd then Daniel pulls down his lower eyelids--Daniel KishLet me just--Lulu Miller--and removes his eyes. They're prosthetic, of course, and they clink a little bit as he hands them over to me.Lulu MillerThat's so cool.Two of the most beautiful hazel-blue eyes I've ever seen in the palm of his hand.Lulu MillerCan I hold them?Daniel KishYeah.Lulu MillerOK. Is it OK if my hand--Daniel KishMm-hmm.Lulu MillerWow. They are so lifelike. Does it feel odd to not have them in?Daniel KishYes.Lulu MillerOh, it does?Daniel KishOh, yes.Lulu MillerOK.Daniel's eyes had to be removed when he was just a toddler because of cancer.Daniel KishRetinoblastoma, which is basically eye cancer.Lulu MillerAnd yet he's the one who's led me on this hike deep into the woods. We get to forks in the road, and he knows they're there. He leads me across a footbridge that's maybe two and a half feet wide without slowing down.Daniel KishI think we've passed what I was looking for.Lulu MillerAnd over and over, the path takes us right alongside the edge of a cliff. And Daniel gets within inches but always senses it. So how does he do it? Well, he's got a cane and a hiking stick. But mainly--Daniel Kish[TONGUE CLICKING]Lulu Miller--he clicks.Daniel KishYou press the tongue on the roof of the mouth.Lulu MillerIs it kind of like [TONGUE CLICKING]?Daniel KishYou're creating a vacuum.Lulu MillerHuh.He clicks with his tongue as a way of understanding where he is in space. This is basically what bats do. Echolocation, the scientists call it. It's like sonar. From the way those clicks bounce off of things in the environment, Daniel gets a sort of sonic representation of what's around him.Daniel KishSo here, [TONGUE CLICKING], I can sense trees poking up.Lulu MillerNow, Daniel just happened to intuitively invent this when he was a toddler. No one taught him or trained him. He just made it up. And since he's been doing it his whole life, he's now so good at it that he can tell all sorts of things about what's in front of him-- if there's a wall, if the vegetation is dense or sparse.Daniel KishSo here's a bench.Lulu MillerYep.Daniel KishGarbage bins.Lulu MillerDing, ding, ding.Daniel KishOuthouse.Lulu MillerWow.And not only does this allow him to hike--Daniel KishSo we'll go this way.Lulu Miller--navigate foreign cities alone, rock climb, horseback ride, but the one that gets all the attention is that he can ride a bicycle.News Reporter 1Meet Daniel Kish. He's blind, but that doesn't stop him from riding his bike.Lulu MillerYou may have heard of Daniel Kish before.News Reporter 2Daniel Kish is completely blind.Lulu MillerHe's usually called the Batman.News Reporter 3This real life Batman--Lulu MillerBecause he is the man who clicks, like a bat.News Reporter 4His remarkable, bat-like abilities.Lulu MillerAnd he has made the media rounds to demonstrate what is usually described as his most amazing--News Reporter 5Extraordinary.News Reporter 6Phenomenal.News Reporter 7Remarkable.Lulu Miller--nearly superhuman ability of being able to ride a bicycle even though he is blind.News Reporter 8As you watch him, remember, he can't see a thing.Lulu MillerA narrative that Daniel thinks is all wrong.Brian Bushway(SINGING) Dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee. Step right up! Step right up! The amazing Daniel Kish will demonstrate one of his greatest tricks to date.Lulu MillerThis is Daniel's buddy Brian Bushway, who has had to watch his poor friend wheel out the old bicycle so many times for the media that he couldn't help but mock the whole set up when I asked him to do it for me.Brian BushwayAnd then he will proceed to mount himself on a bike and ride.Lulu MillerAnd though Daniel indulged, pulling figure eights and riding beautifully as I ran beside him with my microphone, the two of them made it clear that my amazement was kind of offensive.Brian BushwaySo step right up, step right up, and see the amazing Daniel Kish do something that everybody can, but most people don't.Lulu MillerAnd here's where we get back to expectations. See, Daniel thinks there is nothing amazing about him. He thinks that most blind people who don't have other disabilities could do things like ride bikes.Daniel KishI definitely think that most blind people could move around with fluidity and confidence if that were the expectation.Lulu MillerSee, he thinks the reason that more blind people don't isn't just because they haven't learned to click. But it's because the expectations that you or I are carrying around in our own heads about what blind people can do are simply way too low.Daniel KishThey wouldn't be able to hike. They wouldn't be able to run. They wouldn't be able to engage in manual labor.Lulu MillerDaniel, like Bob, thinks those expectations, those private thoughts in our heads, are extremely powerful things, because over time, they have the ability to change the blind person we are thinking about.Daniel KishThat psychology becomes inculcated in the blind person, absorbed and translated into physical reality.Lulu MillerAnd so Daniel thinks if we could all change our expectations of what blind people are capable of, then not only would you see a lot more blind people on bikes, but--Daniel KishMore blind people could--Lulu Miller--in a very real way--Daniel Kish--see.Lulu MillerYeah, he just said "see."Daniel KishIt's actually pretty simple and straightforward.Lulu MillerAnd it turns out neuroscientists are looking into this idea and seeing some pretty shocking results. And we'll get there. But first, to understand what Daniel means, how expectations could give a blind person vision, we need to first see how Daniel himself shot through this forcefield of low expectations, a story which starts back in 1967, when Daniel was 13 months old, and that second eyeball had just been removed.Paulette KishOh, my gosh.Lulu MillerThis is Danielle's mother, Paulette Kish. And a few days after taking her son home from the hospital, Paulette realized she was facing a really difficult choice.Paulette KishMy mom thought that I should put him in cotton.Lulu MillerCotton?Paulette KishWrap him in cotton so that he didn't get hurt, so that he was so protected. That's really how she felt.Lulu MillerSee, Daniel was a very rambunctious little guy.Paulette KishHe started climbing when he was six months old, before he even walked.Lulu MillerAnd that didn't change when he went blind.Paulette KishWe had bookshelves he would climb, so I'd have to move everything off the bookshelves, because he would get into them.Lulu MillerSo Paulette needed to decide, was her mom right? Was it time to start putting some restrictions on him, or was she going to raise him like a seeing child, allow him to explore his world with very few restrictions on him for blindness? And Paulette went with option two. She was going to banish her fear.Paulette KishJust put it away. In the beginning, I think that's what I did. I just put it away.Lulu MillerAnd so, when two police officers showed up at her door--Paulette KishTwo big, huge police officers holding my child.Lulu Miller--having picked up Daniel for climbing the fence into their neighbor's yard--Paulette KishYou can't let him do that. He could fall.Lulu Miller--Paulette felt their same worries--Paulette KishIt's very scary.Lulu Miller--but didn't make Daniel stop.Daniel KishI just climbed everything I could find.Lulu MillerAnd when the elementary school called and asked her to make Daniel stop clicking--Paulette KishIt's not socially acceptable, is what they would say.Lulu Miller--Paulette said, too bad.Paulette KishHe needs to know what's around him, and that's how he does it.Lulu MillerAnd so Daniel clicked, [TONGUE CLICKING], past people doing double takes on the street, [TONGUE CLICKING], occasionally bumping into things.Daniel Kish(CHUCKLING) Yep.Paulette KishAnd then pretty soon--Lulu MillerYour blind kid is not only scaling trees and fences by himself, but using just his clicks-- not even using a cane at that point-- he's walking to school by himself, crossing busy roads, exploring his way into neighbors' driveways.Daniel KishA friend of the family had an undersized bike, and I started riding alongside this retainer wall, until I realized I didn't really need the wall and I could roll alongside the wall without having to touch the wall. And then--Paulette KishOh, goodness.Daniel KishI just could ride it.Lulu MillerHe'd have to click way more than usual.Daniel KishPeppering the environment with a barrage of clicks. [TONGUE CLICKING]Lulu MillerBut by six years old, he could do it-- ride completely comfortably on the bike.Daniel Kish[CHUCKLING]Lulu MillerAnd when neighbors would pop their heads out the door--Paulette KishHow can you let him do that?Lulu Miller--with their concerns--Distorted VoicesHow can you let him do that? How can you let him do that? How can you let him do that?Lulu Miller--she'd look at his smiling face--Daniel Kish[CHUCKLING]Lulu Miller--and think--Paulette KishHow can I not?Alix SpiegelHey, Lulu?Lulu MillerYeah, Alix?Alix SpiegelCan I cut in with a question?Lulu MillerYeah.Alix SpiegelDid he ever get hurt? Like, really hurt?Lulu MillerWell--Daniel KishI used to have this game, get to the top of our road and yell, dive bomb, and I would ride insanely fast down the road. And everyone would have to scatter. Well, one day, I did the dive bomb thing, and as I was screaming down this road, bang. I just collided into a metal light pole.Lulu MillerOy.Daniel KishBlood everywhere.Lulu MillerAnd this was not the only pole in Daniel's life. On the schoolyard, he ran into a pole and knocked out his front teeth.Daniel KishTeeth.Lulu MillerA few years after that, he ran straight into a soccer shed.Daniel KishAnd it just destroyed my whole mouth.Lulu MillerSo yeah, he got injured pretty badly a bunch of times. But the way that Paulette reacted to these injuries--Paulette KishMm-hmm.Lulu Miller--was that she always let him keep going. I mean, shortly after the bike thing, a bicycle appeared under the Christmas tree.Alix SpiegelAnd, like, I am a mother, and I think that if my kid kept showing up with his front teeth knocked out, I would begin to wonder if I had made the right choice.Lulu MillerYeah. Paulette knows it seems extreme, which brings me to the reason she decided to do this, to raise her blind kid so differently from the way that most blind kids are raised.Paulette KishIt was my first marriage. It was not a good marriage.Daniel KishMy father was an alcoholic, and he was abusive.Lulu MillerDaniel's biological father, who's now dead, would hit Paulette.Daniel KishSort of a barroom brawler type.Lulu MillerAnd he was tough with Daniel and Daniel's little brother, taught them to fight.Daniel KishAnd we had to learn to sort of take physical punishment, as it were, and be able to dish it back.Lulu MillerAnd Paulette says this is why she ended up being so hands-off with Daniel.Paulette Kish[SIGH] Everything that happens in your life has its effect, has its effect.Lulu MillerShe says that after years of feeling so small and powerless in that marriage, when she finally made it out, she vowed never to be ruled by fear again.Paulette KishI mean, there's life, and then there is living your life. There is a difference.Lulu MillerAnd the same would go for Daniel. She refused to let those scary thoughts of what could happen make her keep Daniel too close.Lulu MillerBut what if Daniel ended up being hit by a car and killed?I asked her.Lulu MillerLike, what if-- what if a car just hits and just plows him down?Paulette KishBut that could happen to anyone. That could happen to anyone. There was a group of four kids on the corner up about a block, a car went up the curb and hit them, killed two of them. It could happen to anyone.Lulu MillerAnd so bikes were bought for Christmas.Paulette KishYeah.Lulu MillerAnd tree climbing was permitted.Paulette KishOK. I'll just close my eyes.Lulu MillerAnd this blind little boy was allowed to wander the world as freely as any sighted child.Daniel KishFrom the fifth grade on, I walked to school almost every day. I had to cross major streets. I participated in extracurricular activities. I made my own breakfast. I made my own lunch.Alix SpiegelI mean, were they considered outside the norm? Did they consider themselves outside the norm?Lulu MillerI don't think they noticed it much. I don't think they thought about it much. Particularly Daniel didn't know that there was anything odd about the way he got around the world.Daniel KishUntil Adam.Adam ShaibleMy name is Adam Shaible. Excuse me for a second.Lulu MillerSo Alix?Alix SpiegelYeah.Lulu MillerThis is where the story takes a kind of complicated turn, because Adam is basically the first other blind person that Daniel ever encounters. They meet in the fifth grade, when Adam suddenly enrolls in Daniel's school.Adam ShaibleI will say, I was a rather small fellow at the time. When I was 11, 12, I was under 60 pounds.Lulu MillerWow.And Daniel was not exactly welcoming.Adam ShaibleHe just wasn't a nice-- a nice fellow.Lulu MillerDaniel said that Adam completely unnerved him because of how incapable he was of getting around on his own.Daniel KishLiterally just running into walls. I mean, he would just walk along, and his forehead would connect with a wall. And we'd be on the other side of that wall, and we would say, OK, that's Adam, he's coming, kind of thing.Lulu MillerIs that true? Was it, like, that bad?Adam ShaibleYeah.Lulu MillerAdam says he had simply never needed to get around on his own before.Adam ShaibleI went to the School for the Blind from age five to age seven.Lulu MillerAnd there, he was taken around on someone's arm almost all the time. In the lunchroom, people brought him his food. They helped him carry his books, helped him tie his shoelaces.Adam ShaibleI don't know why people did things for me. They just did.Lulu MillerAnd Daniel was baffled by Adam.Daniel KishAt the time, I had not really conceptualized blindness in that way for myself. And I just didn't understand it.Lulu MillerHe'd come home to his mom mystified.Paulette KishHe'd say, Adam can't do anything on his own.Adam ShaibleIf I got lost, I used to get terrified.Daniel KishWhy?Adam ShaibleI just-- I didn't feel safe.Daniel KishWhy?Lulu MillerAnd then what happened is that the kids at school started to mix up Daniel and Adam.Daniel KishPeople started just lumping us together as the blind kids. We were the same age.Lulu MillerYou were the blind boys.Daniel KishYeah. They'd mix up our names, and I didn't like that at all.Lulu MillerAnd so almost to prove his distinction from Adam--Daniel KishI did the things that kids will do in situations like that.Lulu MillerWhat did you do?Daniel KishUm--Paulette KishHe made fun of Adam.Lulu MillerHe started bullying him.Adam ShaibleI wondered if there was something I had done.Lulu MillerHe'd tease him in front of other kids--Daniel KishI was pretty brutal.Lulu Miller--and even beat him up a few times.Adam ShaibleYeah.Daniel KishAnd that, in my aggressive little mind, was the thing that set me apart.Adam ShaibleI wanted to be his friend.Alix SpiegelSo then what happened?Lulu MillerUm--Daniel KishTime moved on.Lulu MillerAdam and Daniel went to different schools, and Daniel just tried his best to forget this kid so like him, who couldn't get around in the world.Daniel KishAnd um, we just lost track--Adam ShaibleWe just lost track of each other.Lulu MillerDaniel goes off to college, doesn't really associate himself with the blind community. His plan is to become a researcher, an autism researcher. And then one day, he happens to pick up this book.Bob ScottThe title isTheMakingofBlindMen.Daniel KishTheMakingofBlindMenby Robert Scott.Bob ScottI go by Bob. You can spell that either way.Lulu MillerAll right.This is the book's author, Bob Scott, a former professor of sociology at Princeton. And inside this book was the idea that would change Daniel's life, an idea that when you first hear it sounds kind of out there-- that blindness is a social construction.Alix SpiegelWait, was Bob saying that people are not physically blind?Lulu MillerKind of. But let me just tell you how he gets there.Alix SpiegelOK.Lulu MillerOK?Alix SpiegelOK.Lulu MillerSo fresh out of grad school, Bob got this job to conduct a huge, multi-year long survey to see how effective blindness organizations were at helping the blind.Bob ScottYep.Lulu MillerAnd so he begins interviewing hundreds of blind people, goes out on hundreds of site visits.Bob ScottBasically gathering information in any way I could imagine that I could get it.Lulu MillerAnd then one day, many months into the process, he had--Bob ScottWhat might be called an aha moment.Lulu MillerHe was out walking in a snowstorm in New York City, when he happened to see--Bob ScottA blind beggar--Lulu Miller--asking for money--Bob Scott--standing on the corner at Bloomingdale's.Lulu MillerAnd he thought, hey, someone else to interview for my survey.Bob ScottI said, would you allow me to buy some of your time? And I gave him-- I don't know-- $25 or something like that. We went in and sat down at a restaurant, and I said, tell me your story.Lulu MillerTurns out the man had worked at a paint factory until a few years before, when an accident there left him blind. And the people at the factory really liked the guy, so they said, look, why don't you go to an organization for the blind, get some training, and then come back and work for us? So the guy said, great.He went to an organization for the blind. He said, I've got this job all lined up. Can you just help me with a few basic things. And the blindness organization said no.Bob ScottOh, no. You can't do that. Blind people can't do those things. What we're going to do is put you through a program of rehabilitation and then move you along to our sheltered workshop that manufactures mops and brooms.Lulu MillerAnd Bob said there was one sentence in that response that jumped out at him.Bob ScottBlind people can't do those things.Lulu MillerAnd he began to wonder, wait, is that true? Could this guy really not work in a paint factory? Because over the course of his research, he'd seen blind people that could do all sorts of things. And the more that Bob looked around, he started to see that message--Bob ScottBlind people can't do those things.Lulu Miller--being communicated to the blind people by the blind organizations that serve them-- not necessarily always as explicitly as in the case of the paint guy.Alix SpiegelLike, how else then?Lulu MillerWell, take the fact that at that time, of the almost 20,000 blind kids that were in America, 2/3 of them were being kept on the sidelines in gym class. Play tag, run around on your own--Bob ScottBlind people can't do those things.Lulu MillerAnd then there was the organization's insistence that adult blind people get help getting around.Bob ScottThey are picked up at their homes. They're driven there. They're met at the sidewalk, walked into the agency, escorted to wherever they're going-- everything is being done for them.Lulu MillerAnd even though all this was intended to help, Bob began to wonder if maybe, just maybe, the organizations' low expectations for what blind people could do was in some way actually limiting the blind people that those organizations sought to help.Bob ScottWhat I came to realize is that how they functioned was a process of learning. It was not imposed on them entirely by the fact that they couldn't see.Alix SpiegelHey, Lulu?Lulu MillerYeah, Alix?Alix SpiegelSo is Bob saying that blindness is mostly in our head? That blind people can actually do everything that sighted people can do? Because my dad is blind, and he is very, very limited in what he can do. And I gotta say, I don't feel like the obstacles that he faces are obstacles that he wouldn't face if he just thought differently about his blindness.Lulu MillerWell, Bob is pretty hardcore about this. I think he would say that with enough time, your dad actually could do a lot more, because he thinks the only real absolute physical limitation of blindness is about an inability to perceive things in the distance.Bob ScottExactly, anything that I can't reach out and touch.Lulu MillerBut you can compensate for everything else. And Alix?Alix SpiegelUh-huh?Lulu MillerBob wasn't actually the first person to come up with this idea. Blind people were. A group called the National Federation of the Blind has for a long time advocated this kind of idea. This is a group formed by blind people for blind people, and they think that the physical condition of blindness--Bob ScottIt doesn't explain nearly as much as people believe it explains.Alix SpiegelSo if you buy this logic, people who are blind-- like, the only thing that's standing between them and walking around the world, like Daniel does, is our beliefs?Lulu MillerYeah. You know, that sounds totally crazy, and that is exactly what he's saying. Which brings us back to Daniel. Daniel reads this book, and he starts thinking about Adam.Adam ShaibleIf I got lost, I used to get terrified.Lulu MillerYou know, maybe it wasn't that Adam was this weirdo, tentative kid but that he was a very typical product of a system.Alix SpiegelYou mean, like, the system taught Adam that he would have trouble moving around.Lulu MillerYeah. I mean, he was led around school. People brought him his food--Adam ShaibleI don't know why people did things for me. They just did.Lulu MillerAnd when Daniel looked at the world around him, he thought, you know, a lot has changed. But a lot is frighteningly similar.Alix SpiegelFrom then till today, things are similar?Daniel KishYeah.Lulu MillerYeah.Daniel KishYeah.Lulu MillerI called around to over a dozen blindness organizations all over the country.Daniel NorrisMy name is Daniel Norris, supervisor of adult services for the Vermont Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired.Lulu MillerAnd supervisor after supervisor told me that what Bob Scott saw is still very much alive today.Alix SpiegelIn what way?Lulu MillerSo most children who are blind in America don't actually go to schools for the blind anymore.Daniel NorrisRight.Lulu MillerThanks to the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, most blind kids stay in their local public schools, which is great. But on those public school grounds, says Norris--Daniel NorrisThere is a lot of pressure to keep a child safe, especially in a litigious society.Lulu MillerSo many of the blind students are still placed with a paraeducator, which can be good. But sometimes--Daniel NorrisThose paraeducators can end up doing the work for the kids.Lulu MillerLike Adam.Daniel NorrisWhen you lighten someone's load, you don't allow them to expand.Lulu MillerI talked to mothers whose blind kids were pulled off of playground equipment. And perhaps the most chilling thing is the fact that most blind kids will intuitively start clicking--Daniel Kish[TONGUE CLICKING]Lulu Miller--or snapping or stamping to test out their environment with sound. But they are so often discouraged--Paulette KishIt's not socially acceptable, is what they would say.Lulu Miller--that they never get the chance to develop their skill to the level Daniel did.Daniel NorrisSo how are we doing as a nation? We have not taught independence.Lulu MillerHe points out that in America, a majority of blind people are unemployed. And while that could be for a lot of reasons, Norris thinks that's on us.Daniel KishWhat we are doing is we are creating slaves to others' thinking.Lulu MillerThat's Daniel Kish again.Daniel KishSlaves to others' perception, slaves to what others think they should be doing. And somehow we're comfortable with that.Lulu MillerAnd so, though he had never wanted to work in the profession of blindness-- in fact, he'd wanted to get as far away from it as he could-- Daniel Kish decided he sort of had no choice.Daniel KishIt sucked me in kind of kicking and screaming.Lulu MillerHe could see what was happening. And he held in his tongue, [TONGUE CLICKING], a way out. So he decided that he would dedicate his life to trying to liberate blind children.Alix SpiegelKind of like Batman?Lulu MillerExactamundo, fighting for good in the world in a kind of vigilante way, because actually, the way that you go about liberating a blind child from the constraining forces of culture, it can get kind of ugly.Ira GlassComing up, the Dark Knight rises. Lulu and Alix are back in a minute, from Chicago Public Radio, when our program continues.Act Two: The Dark Knight RisesIra GlassIt'sThisAmericanLife. I'm Ira Glass. Today on our program, we have a story from a brand new radio show and podcast calledInvisibilia. It's from NPR News. Science reporters Alix Spiegel and Lulu Miller are the hosts. And they're here today talking about how profoundly other people's expectations can affect us and about a blind man named Daniel Kish. Anyway, again, here's Alix.Alix SpiegelSo when last we met Daniel, he had decided that he was going to become a kind of real-life Batman who would save people who were blind from the low expectations of their culture. But before we keep going, I should probably point out that lots of blind people don't necessarily want him as their savior. A bunch of them told us, basically, clicks shmicks!Bob RingwaldBecause I get along just fine without doing that clicking noise, or whatever he calls it.Alix SpiegelThis is Bob Ringwald, a musician in California. He says he's got a cane. It works great. He does everything he wants.Bob RingwaldWhen I wanted to learn guitar, I did, and I've done a lot of climbing around on my roof and climbing up poles. And anything I wanted to do, I did.Alix SpiegelNow, Bob Ringwald-- in fact, all of the blind people that we spoke to for this story-- agreed with Daniel that low expectations hold blind people back. But that didn't necessarily mean that they wanted to echolocate. For example, when Bob Ringwald was seven, in school for the blind back in the '50s, he knew some kids who clicked and said they just seemed a little weird.Bob RingwaldI really didn't want to go through life clicking all the time. A lot of people think blind people are strange. So I didn't want to be any stranger than I already was.Eric WoodsA lot of instructors don't like people to do that, because it does look funny.Alix SpiegelEric Woods is also blind, and a retired mobility instructor in Colorado.Eric WoodsAnd it's socially unacceptable-- not unacceptable, but it's socially different. And so it has been discouraged. I've heard plenty of people discourage it.Alix SpiegelAnd Daniel knew this. He knew what he was up against. So Lulu, what did Daniel do?Lulu MillerWell, he starts up a nonprofit, as you do-- a nonprofit that will teach people how to echolocate.Voice On VideoGrace.Lulu MillerThis is one of his early instructional videos. It's now 2001, and since his aim is nothing short of liberation, he calls it World Access for the Blind.Voice On VideoWorld Access for the Blind.Lulu MillerNow, the only little problem that he runs into is that at that time, a blind person teaching another blind person how to get around is basically unheard of.Daniel KishThe blind cannot lead the blind is right out of the Bible. It's fundamental to our culture.Lulu MillerIn fact, until the mid '90s--Daniel KishThere was no certification for blind people to train other blind people.Alix SpiegelWow.Bob ScottBlind people can't do those things.Lulu MillerSo this is actually when the bike trick became big-- like, though he sort of hates "Look at the blind man ride a bike," he realized that could get him attention. So he starts going on all these TV shows with his trick.Daniel KishAnd my segment was between something about vampires and some other thing about faith healing or whatever.Lulu MillerAnd on these TV appearances, he'd try to send some sort of signal to blind kids who might be watching, who might be able to contact him.[APPLAUSE]Tv HostDan, can anyone learn this?Daniel KishEcholocation is a skill-- piano playing, for example. Some people may be more talented than others, but I think that anyone could learn it.Lulu MillerAnd it worked.Daniel KishYeah.Lulu MillerSlowly but surely, families started contacting him, which meant that Daniel was now faced with a question. Could he actually undo the damage of low expectations? And this is where things begin to get a little morally complicated.Daniel KishThe example I'm about to give is an example that took place about 10 years ago.Lulu MillerDaniel told me about going out to teach one of his first students ever, a little 10-year-old boy.Daniel KishHe lives on an apple orchard--Lulu MillerOut in Washington state.Daniel KishI come out. And basically, what I see is a boy who won't leave his house.Lulu MillerAnd so Daniel's idea was to get him to climb a tree.Daniel KishThey live on an orchard full of trees, for goodness' sakes.Lulu MillerBut the kid won't budge. So to get him out the door, Daniel takes away all his toys.Daniel KishOur purpose was to kind of simulate the world that he was choosing for himself. So this is what life will have in store for you-- basically nothing, OK? Nothing.Lulu MillerAnd after about a week, the kid finally agrees to go climb a frickin' tree. And he gets up onto the first branch and the second branch and then says, OK.Daniel KishI give up. I give up. Yeah, but you know what? Giving up isn't an option. You can decide never to climb a tree for the rest of your life, but we are going to climb this one. And I said, you can go up, you cannot go down. And he just had a fit-- literally screaming himself hoarse. I mean, he actually jumped at one point. Like, he actually leapt off the tree, he was in such a frenzy.Alix SpiegelOh my god, Lulu. And what does Daniel do?Lulu MillerWell, he catches him. He's right below him. And he just says, no.Daniel KishYou can go up. You cannot go down.Lulu MillerAnd they stay in this tree battling it out.Daniel KishInch by inch by-- it took three hours to get up a 60-foot tree.Lulu MillerBut by the end, the kid was doing it himself.Daniel Kish--doing it himself. He started finding his own footholds, finding his own handholds.Lulu MillerAnd Daniel thinks this training and how the parents then took it on too changed the boy's life.Daniel KishBy the age of 13, he was out of his shell. He had joined Boy Scouts. That is in no way where he was headed.Alix SpiegelHm. That is just crazy, though, that story, on some level. I don't know if that kind of bullying is even allowed in America anymore, you know?Lulu MillerYeah. And most schools for the blind have been reluctant to hire him because of liability issues. They're scared it'll be too dangerous for their students.Alix SpiegelI bet.Lulu MillerBut see, Daniel would say that attitude, Alix, is part of the problem. So what are a few tears, huh, a few scratches? He has this line he always says.Daniel KishRunning into a pole is a drag. But never being allowed to run into a pole is a disaster.Lulu MillerHe worries that when you prevent a kid from, say, running into a pole, what you end up preventing them from is the kind of experience that allow for-- and this gets me back to that crazy sounding claim he made at the beginning of the show-- actual sight.Daniel KishIf our culture recognized the capacity of blind people to see, then more blind people would learn to see. It's actually pretty simple and straightforward.Lulu MillerDaniel thinks this because, well, he says he sees.Daniel KishI definitely would say that I experience images, that I have images.Lulu MillerAnd he isn't talking metaphorically here.Daniel KishThey are images of spatial character and depth that have a lot of the same qualities that a person who sees would see.Lore ThalerHello?Lulu MillerHi.Lore ThalerHi.Lulu MillerThis is Lore Thaler, a German neuroscientist at Durham University in the UK. And Lore knows a lot about sight. She studies vision in the brain-- literally how the images we see are constructed.Lore ThalerIt sounds simple, but an image is actually a complex construct.Lulu MillerSeveral years ago, Lore happened across a video of Daniel.Daniel KishOK, so we had a little string of parked vehicles there--Lulu MillerAnd as she watched the way that he so easily moved through space, she found herself wondering, was there any way that Daniel's brain was indeed constructing images?Lore ThalerIt was so akin to vision, really.Lulu MillerOK, so you may know this already, but Lore reminded me that an image, even though it feels like it's out there in the world in front of your eyes actually exists behind the eyes.Lore ThalerThe image, it's something that your mind constructs.Lulu MillerIn a part of your brain called the visual cortex. So Lore brought Daniel and a few other people who can echolocate into her lab, and she took recordings of them while they clicked at different objects in space.Daniel Kish[TONGUE CLICKING]Lulu MillerA car, a lamppost-- these are her actual recordings-- a salad bowl, a salad bowl in motion.Alix SpiegelHow do you get a salad bowl in motion?Lulu MillerYou stand behind the person with a salad bowl on a fishing pole, and you slowly wave it.Alix SpiegelRight.Lulu MillerAnd the microphones were actually in their ears.Lore ThalerSo we recorded what they heard exactly.Alix SpiegelOh, that's neat.Lulu MillerAnd then she played the recordings back to them, one object at a time, while they were lying down in fMRI machines, so she could watch how their brains responded. [TONGUE CLICKING] Salad bowl. [TONGUE CLICKING] Salad bowl in motion.And then in a second study, she compared those readings to what happens in the brains of sighted people looking at the same kinds of things. Salad bowl. Salad bowl in motion.Alix SpiegelVery clever, very clever.Lulu MillerYep. And what she found is that even though for decades scientists assumed that the visual cortex goes dark when you are blind, Daniel's was lighting up like a disco ball.Lore ThalerYeah, so that was really very impressive.Lulu MillerAnd the way in which it was lighting up-- this is really cool. So it turns out that there are all these different parts of the brain involved in vision. So there's an area that's specifically dedicated to processing motion, and that's way over here behind the ears. And then there's a completely different area for texture--Lore ThalerLightness, so how bright is something.Lulu Miller--orientation, shape. And in Daniel's brain, many of these areas were lighting up. Color and brightness, no action there. But motion, when they did that salad bowl in motion test, the motion area behind the ears started pumping with blood flow.Lore ThalerVery vigorously.Lulu MillerAnd orientation-- turns out there's sort of a grid for orientation in the brain. And she could watch as the salad bowl moved across those quadrants.Lore ThalerIt was really robust, highly significant.Lulu MillerAll right, Miss Spiegel. So I know that sometimes neurology and neuroscience--Alix SpiegelGoes over my head?Lulu MillerOr just sounds like a foreign language that you're not particularly interested in speaking.Alix SpiegelUh-huh. Just land the plane for me. What does this mean?Lulu MillerWhat this work suggests is that you may not actually need eyes to see.Lulu MillerI kind of feel like we've got to shout it from the rooftops. Come on.Alix SpiegelOh my god.Lulu MillerOK. You might not need eyes to see!Now, Lore is by no means the only person seeing this result. The idea first started coming up in the mid '90s, when a lab at Harvard saw that visual areas of the brain can be activated by sound and touch.Alix SpiegelDo I have to do it?Lulu MillerUh-huh.Alix SpiegelYou might not need eyes to see!Lulu MillerAnd since then, dozens of labs have been looking into just how nuanced and rich that visual imagery may be. So there's a guy at Berkeley, Santani Teng, who's been trying to determine the acuity of these images. You know, like an eye test-- how close to 20/20 are they?Alix SpiegelUh-huh.Lulu MillerAnd what he's found is that their 75% localization thresholds indicated spatial acuity as fine as 1.5 degrees of the subtended angle.Alix SpiegelNo!Lulu MillerIt's true! I'll put it another way. He thinks their world looks a lot like your peripheral vision. So imagine that you're texting on your cellphone walking down the street. OK, you're looking at that screen. Now, what does the street look like to you?You know, you can see people coming at you. You can see cars. You can see trees. But you couldn't read a sign. That, he thinks, is Daniel's world.Daniel KishI can honestly, honestly say that I do not feel blind.Alix SpiegelSo what does Lore say about this? Does she think that the echolocators are actually seeing?Lulu MillerWell--Lore ThalerThat's almost philosophical, isn't it?Lulu MillerLore asks the only people on Earth who can know-- people who use to see. You know, is what they're experiencing comparable?Brian BushwayYeah, oh yeah.Lulu MillerThis is Brian Bushway, who you met briefly at the top of the show.Brian BushwaySo step right up!I became totally blind at the age of 14.Lulu MillerBut once he learned echolocation--Brian BushwayJust [SNAP] like that!Lulu Miller--the world around him, although blurrier and colorless, appeared again.Brian BushwayThings are real. I mean, it's as real as looking at it.Alix SpiegelWait, wait, wait. So Lulu, does every blind person have this?Lulu MillerNo. And that's the thing-- Lore has looked at the brains of people who do not echolocate, and though there's definitely some activity in the visual cortex, it's simply not as active. Which brings me back to Daniel's teaching methods. The thing about echolocation is, yes, you can learn it when you get older. But it gets so much harder with age, which is why Daniel doesn't give a damn about making a little kid cry, because he thinks at the other end of those tears is sight.Daniel KishOK, off we go.Lulu MillerSo I finally got to see one of these training sessions in action. We went to see a five-year-old boy named Nathan Nip.Daniel KishOK, so what we'll do then is we'll ask Nathan's mom about parks or some place that he doesn't know.Lulu MillerBrian's with us too, actually. He's now one of Daniel's deputy teachers.Daniel KishHe can click.Lulu MillerAnd part of the goal that day was to get Nathan out of his comfort zone. But the bigger part-- and really, what is often this other major part of what Daniel is trying to teach-- is to get the people around Nathan to back off.Daniel KishHello?GodmotherHi!Lulu MillerSo we go into the house.Nathan NipI am five and a half, and Ashton's two.Lulu MillerDaniel asks to hear Nathan's clicks.Nathan Nip[TONGUE CLICKING]Daniel KishYou have a nice smiley click.Lulu MillerAnd then we head out to a faraway park.Brian BushwayWhere are we? Where do you think we are?Nathan NipAt the field!Brian BushwayAt the field.Lulu MillerDing, ding, ding. It's a sports field flanked by a really busy road.Brian BushwayNathan? Nathan?Lulu MillerAnd the idea is to make Nathan find his way around this park by himself.Brian BushwaySo we want to use our, [TONGUE CLICKING], our clicks. And we're going to explore what's around here in this park. Let's see if we can find anything, OK?Nathan NipYeah.Brian BushwayOK.Lulu MillerSo he finds a soccer net.Brian BushwayYeah.Lulu MillerHe tries to find a fence at one side of the park--Brian BushwayWell, you're-- yeah, we're in the bushes.Lulu Miller--but gets a little turned around.Brian BushwayCome back toward me. Nathan, come back toward me.Lulu MillerAnd then it's time to find the edge of the road.Brian BushwayWhat noises do we hear right now?Nathan NipCars?Brian BushwayCars.Lulu MillerSo Brian tells Nathan to walk toward those cars.Brian BushwayAnd we'll all follow behind you.Lulu MillerAt this point, it's just me and the godmother and Brian.Nathan NipWhere's Ashton?Brian BushwayHe's over there.Lulu MillerEveryone else is on the other side of the park.Nathan NipCan we please go to him?Brian BushwayNo.Nathan NipWhy?Lulu MillerNathan is leading.Brian BushwayCan I hear you click?Nathan Nip[TONGUE CLICKING].Lulu MillerAnd picture this-- I mean, this is, like, a little five-year-old boy with a tiny white cane--Alix SpiegelKind of tapping his way towards oncoming traffic?Lulu MillerTapping his way toward oncoming traffic, which is a jarring sight. And the person closest to him is Brian, who is also blind.Brian BushwayListen out in front of you. Listen into the distance.Lulu MillerAnd he's getting closer and closer to the edge of the road. Four feet, three feet, and then--[CAR APPROACHING][SILENCE]--his godmother just shoots out and grabs him back. And Brian kind of noticeably flinched.Brian BushwayLet's try to stay, like, more  or less behind him.Lulu MillerBecause while he completely understands why the godmother would reach out for Nathan, he said it is precisely that kind of moment that does the damage.Brian BushwayOften sighted people will jump in a half a second too soon, and they rob the blind student from that learning moment. And that just keeps happening over and over again, and I think so many blind people's lives, they never get that moment of what it is to really have that self-confidence to trust your senses to know, oh, if I do use my cane properly and I am listening attentively to information around me, I'll be OK.Lulu MillerI think part of the problem is that when we have eyes, we can see things coming from further away. The whole point is, like, when it's your cane and you're clicking, you catch edges at what appears like the last moment.Brian BushwayWe don't need to go any farther. Why? Why don't we need to go any further?Nathan Nip'Cause there's cars.Brian BushwayYeah, so it means the street's here.Nathan Nip[TONGUE CLICKING].Alix SpiegelCan I ask  you a question?Lulu MillerMm-hmm.Alix SpiegelWhat if you're a half-second too late?Lulu MillerRight.Alix SpiegelBecause I think that probably a lot of parents-- I mean, the thing that keeps them reaching out well before the half-second before is kind of the specter of the half-second after.Lulu MillerSo I think you grabbed him there.GodmotherYeah, yeah, yeah.Lulu MillerAnd what was that moment like?Well, this is exactly what Nathan's godmother brought up.GodmotherIt is hard.Lulu MillerShe understands the dangers of a half-second too early.GodmotherHe has to learn how to make that judgment.Lulu MillerBut at the end of the day, she is far more concerned about the dangers of the half-second too late.GodmotherYou don't really want to risk that.Lulu MillerWhich brings me to possibly the biggest thing that Daniel is up against in his quest to change expectations-- love.Daniel NorrisYou can't blame mom and dad for struggling and wanting to keep their child safe.Lulu MillerThis is Dan Norris again from the blindness organization in Vermont. And when we asked him if a change like the one Daniel's hoping for, a massive change in expectations, could actually take place, one of the main obstacles he brought up was love.Daniel NorrisIt's very hard as a parent with a child who's visually impaired to let go.Lulu MillerEven when the expectations for that kid are high, he said love can get in the way.Daniel NorrisThose parents, they want to keep their child safe. They want their child to not suffer. And that's very noble but holds the kids back.Lulu MillerSo in 10 years in the field, how many kids on bikes have you seen, blind kids on bikes?Daniel KishBlind kids on bikes? I have seen about five.Lulu MillerThat's actually pretty good.Daniel KishYeah, I think that we are seeing society begin to change.Lulu MillerBut when he thinks about the sheer volume of love, brimming in every household on every schoolyard and every street corner--Daniel KishAre we going to get there any time soon as a nation? Um, no. I don't think so.Lulu MillerAnd this gets us finally to what may have been Daniel's one true superpower.Daniel KishWhat most people find to be the meaning of life absolutely creeps me out.Lulu MillerDaniel is 49 and has never been with a partner. And he finds the whole idea of physical intimacy--Daniel KishUnsettling.Lulu MillerWe had finally reached the end of our hike, the place Daniel wanted to take me.Daniel KishIs this, like, awesome?Lulu MillerYeah.It was a huge old oak tree, miles from civilization, that Daniel said was one of his favorite spots on Earth.Daniel KishOK.Lulu MillerAnd so we climbed up it together.Daniel KishLet's see where I would go.Lulu Miller20 feet, 30 feet, maybe 40 feet.Lulu MillerYou're very high!And it was there in the branches that he told me he's never really been one for love.Daniel KishI was never that interested in closeness as a kid. I wasn't really a lap-sitter. I didn't like holding hands. I didn't really like hugs.Lulu MillerHe even used to have nightmares about it.Daniel KishA child's mind will turn things into very ghoulish, ghastly, deeply unsettling, spooky things.Lulu MillerLike what? Like, what would be a nightmare about--Daniel KishThere were two.Lulu MillerIn one, a hand chased after him.Daniel KishAnd then the other thing were the plastic arms that want to sort engulf and unfold and just kind of take you in to themselves.Lulu MillerHe's not sure where this comes from. He wonders if it could have been the surgeries he had as a tiny boy or from the way his parents raised him. Or maybe he just always was that way.Daniel KishWho knows?Lulu MillerAnd while he's not suggesting that you need this quality to become independent, when he looks back, he wonders if this may have been one of the things that protected him from the debilitating effects of low expectations. Because unlike the rest of us, when those arms reached out for him, he never once had any desire to fall back into them.Paulette KishEverything that happens in your life has its effect.Lulu MillerThat's his mom again, Paulette.Paulette KishHas its effect.Lulu MillerAnd you don't think it's that Daniel became this way because he was in some way neglected or because it was too hard? Is there any part of you that thinks you went too far in terms of letting him be?Paulette KishNo. No. He's happy.Daniel KishTotally happy.Lulu MillerWe sat there for a while, watching the afternoon slip away.Daniel KishListen to how quiet it is.Lulu MillerAnd suddenly I got that pang you get when you realize it's getting dark, and you are far, far from civilization. And that was followed by another pang that it literally didn't matter, because he'd be the one leading us out.Daniel Kish[TONGUE CLICKING] That's amazing.Lulu MillerYeah.Daniel Kish[TONGUE CLICKING][MUSIC - "BATMAN THEME" BY NEIL HEFTI]Ira GlassLulu Miller and Alix Spiegel ofInvisibilia, the new public radio program and podcast.

It can happen to anyone.Ira GlassI'm Ira Glass. Back next week with more stories ofThisAmericanLife.,PrologueIra GlassSo today we have a story that we think might make you believe something that right now you do not believe. And to tell that story, I'm joined here in the studio by NPR science reporters Alix Spiegel and Lulu Miller. Hey there, guys.Lulu MillerHi.Alix SpiegelHello.Ira GlassAnd do I have this right? So you bought a rat, and you brought it to NPR headquarters in Washington, DC?Alix SpiegelWe did.Lulu MillerAlix bought the rat.Alix SpiegelI did.Ira GlassAnd where at NPR did you bring the rat to?Alix SpiegelWe ferreted it into a little kind of edit booth type thing--[GIGGLING]Lulu MillerHi, buddy!Alix Spiegel--type office. And we invited people into the room one by one.Lulu MillerSo can you just describe what we got here?Male Speaker 1It's a rat.Female Speaker 1Pinkish ears.Male Speaker 2Red eyes.Male Speaker 3Long nose.Alix SpiegelAnd sat them down in front of this rat and asked this question.Lulu MillerDo you think that the thoughts that you have in your head-- OK, the private thoughts that you have in your head-- could influence how that rat moves through space?Male Speaker 1No.Female Speaker 1No.Male Speaker 2No.Male Speaker 3No.Alix SpiegelAnd it was almost unanimous. People did not believe that their personal thoughts would have any effect on the rat at all.Male Speaker 4Because that would suggest some sort of telepathy which I don't have.Alix SpiegelAnd Ira, maybe that's what you think too.Ira GlassThat is what I think. I don't think that people thinking thoughts will affect a rat's behavior.Alix SpiegelWell, you're wrong.Ira GlassNo.Bob Rosenthal(CHUCKLING) Yes.Ira GlassOK, so who's this?Alix SpiegelThis is a man named Bob Rosenthal. He's a research psychologist. And early in his career, he did this thing. He went into his lab late at night and hung signs on all of the rat cages. And some of the signs said that the rat in the cage was incredibly smart. And some of the signs said that the rat in the cage was incredibly dumb, even though neither of those things was true.Bob RosenthalThey were very average rats that you would buy from a research institute that sells rats for a living.Alix SpiegelSo then Bob brings this group of experimenters into his lab, and he says, for the next week, some of you are going to get these incredibly smart rats. And some of you are going to get these incredibly stupid rats. And your job is to run your rat through a maze and record how well it does.Lulu MillerCan you just pick up the rat?Alix SpiegelSo, Ira, we actually did a very lo-fi, unscientific version of this in that little room in NPR.Ira GlassThey let you do that?Alix SpiegelWe didn't ask permission.Male Speaker 4Is that OK to do?Lulu MillerYeah.Alix SpiegelYeah.Lulu MillerAnd you've probably already guessed where this is going.Alix SpiegelYeah. In Bob's real study, the experimenters ran the rats that they had been told were smart.Female Speaker 1She has sort of an intelligent looking face.Alix SpiegelAnd the rats they had been told were dumb.Male Speaker 4Yeah, he seems kind of lazy.Alix SpiegelIt was not even close.Bob RosenthalThe results were so dramatic.Alix SpiegelIn Bob's real study, the smart rats did almost twice as well as the dumb rats.Ira GlassWait, even though they were the same?Alix SpiegelYeah, even though the smart rats were not smart and the dumb rats were not dumb. They were all just the same average kind of lab rat. It was so shocking, people didn't really believe him.Bob RosenthalI was having trouble publishing any of this.Ira GlassAnd so what was going on? Like, what was actually happening to make the rats do this?Alix SpiegelSo what Bob figured out was that the expectations that the experimenters carried in their heads subtly changed the way that the experimenters touched the rats, and that changed the way that the rats behaved. So when the experimenters thought that the rats were really smart, they felt more warmly towards the rats. And so they touched them more gently.Bob RosenthalWe do know that handling rats and handling them more gently can actually increase the performance of rats.Ira GlassAnd how does this play out when it comes to people? How do our expectations of other people work?Alix SpiegelWell, what you saw in the rats totally holds for people too. I talked to Carol Dweck, who's a psychologist and researcher at Stanford.Carol DweckYou may be standing farther away from someone you have lower expectations for. You may not be making as much eye contact. And it's not something you can put your finger on. We are not usually aware of how we are conveying our expectations to other people. But it's there.Alix SpiegelAnd it happens in all kinds of areas. Research has shown that a teacher's expectations can raise or lower a student's IQ score, that a mother's expectations influences the drinking behavior of her middle schooler, that military trainers' expectations can literally make a soldier run faster or slower. So my question was-- you know, how far does this go?Alix SpiegelSo Carol, clearly these expectation effects exist on a continuum. So for example, if I expect that if somebody jumps off a building, they will be able to fly, that's not going to work out so well, right?Carol DweckMm-hmm.Alix SpiegelSo what does science know about where we should draw the line? Does it have a clear sense of that?Carol DweckNo. That line is moving. As we come to understand things that are possible and mechanisms through which a belief affects an outcome or one person affects another person, that line can move.Ira GlassWell, from WBEZ, Chicago, it'sThisAmericanLife. Today on our program, we have a kind of hard to believe example of what expectations can do to people. This story is from a new radio show and podcast that Alix and Lulu are launching this week. It's calledInvisibilia. It's about the invisible forces that shape human behavior, like beliefs and assumptions and emotions, which I know sounds a little abstract. But in execution, I have to say it is anything but.Act One: Batman BeginsIra GlassAlix used to work here at our program. Lulu worked atRadiolab, and their new show is sort of halfway between the two. A quick heads-up before they launch into this. As you may have noticed, their voices sound a lot alike.Lulu MillerThey are.Alix SpiegelSorry. Yeah.Ira GlassYes, I know that is not news to the two of you at all. So stay with us. And Lulu, let's just jump right in. Where do you want to start?Lulu MillerWell, I'll start with a question that I asked the rat scientist, the expectations guy, Bob Rosenthal.Bob RosenthalOK.Lulu MillerCould my expectations make a blind person who literally has no eyeballs see?Bob RosenthalNo way. The expectations will not make him see.Lulu MillerHow sure are you about that one?Bob RosenthalPositive.Lulu MillerSo I'm deep in the woods of Southern California with a man named Daniel Kish. We've been hiking for hours, climbing over tree stumps and along the edges of a steep ravine. And we're just sitting down in the dirt to take a break.Lulu MillerCould we look at your eyes?Daniel KishIn terms of them being out?Lulu MillerYeah.Daniel KishYeah.Lulu MillerAnd then Daniel pulls down his lower eyelids--Daniel KishLet me just--Lulu Miller--and removes his eyes. They're prosthetic, of course, and they clink a little bit as he hands them over to me.Lulu MillerThat's so cool.Two of the most beautiful hazel-blue eyes I've ever seen in the palm of his hand.Lulu MillerCan I hold them?Daniel KishYeah.Lulu MillerOK. Is it OK if my hand--Daniel KishMm-hmm.Lulu MillerWow. They are so lifelike. Does it feel odd to not have them in?Daniel KishYes.Lulu MillerOh, it does?Daniel KishOh, yes.Lulu MillerOK.Daniel's eyes had to be removed when he was just a toddler because of cancer.Daniel KishRetinoblastoma, which is basically eye cancer.Lulu MillerAnd yet he's the one who's led me on this hike deep into the woods. We get to forks in the road, and he knows they're there. He leads me across a footbridge that's maybe two and a half feet wide without slowing down.Daniel KishI think we've passed what I was looking for.Lulu MillerAnd over and over, the path takes us right alongside the edge of a cliff. And Daniel gets within inches but always senses it. So how does he do it? Well, he's got a cane and a hiking stick. But mainly--Daniel Kish[TONGUE CLICKING]Lulu Miller--he clicks.Daniel KishYou press the tongue on the roof of the mouth.Lulu MillerIs it kind of like [TONGUE CLICKING]?Daniel KishYou're creating a vacuum.Lulu MillerHuh.He clicks with his tongue as a way of understanding where he is in space. This is basically what bats do. Echolocation, the scientists call it. It's like sonar. From the way those clicks bounce off of things in the environment, Daniel gets a sort of sonic representation of what's around him.Daniel KishSo here, [TONGUE CLICKING], I can sense trees poking up.Lulu MillerNow, Daniel just happened to intuitively invent this when he was a toddler. No one taught him or trained him. He just made it up. And since he's been doing it his whole life, he's now so good at it that he can tell all sorts of things about what's in front of him-- if there's a wall, if the vegetation is dense or sparse.Daniel KishSo here's a bench.Lulu MillerYep.Daniel KishGarbage bins.Lulu MillerDing, ding, ding.Daniel KishOuthouse.Lulu MillerWow.And not only does this allow him to hike--Daniel KishSo we'll go this way.Lulu Miller--navigate foreign cities alone, rock climb, horseback ride, but the one that gets all the attention is that he can ride a bicycle.News Reporter 1Meet Daniel Kish. He's blind, but that doesn't stop him from riding his bike.Lulu MillerYou may have heard of Daniel Kish before.News Reporter 2Daniel Kish is completely blind.Lulu MillerHe's usually called the Batman.News Reporter 3This real life Batman--Lulu MillerBecause he is the man who clicks, like a bat.News Reporter 4His remarkable, bat-like abilities.Lulu MillerAnd he has made the media rounds to demonstrate what is usually described as his most amazing--News Reporter 5Extraordinary.News Reporter 6Phenomenal.News Reporter 7Remarkable.Lulu Miller--nearly superhuman ability of being able to ride a bicycle even though he is blind.News Reporter 8As you watch him, remember, he can't see a thing.Lulu MillerA narrative that Daniel thinks is all wrong.Brian Bushway(SINGING) Dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee. Step right up! Step right up! The amazing Daniel Kish will demonstrate one of his greatest tricks to date.Lulu MillerThis is Daniel's buddy Brian Bushway, who has had to watch his poor friend wheel out the old bicycle so many times for the media that he couldn't help but mock the whole set up when I asked him to do it for me.Brian BushwayAnd then he will proceed to mount himself on a bike and ride.Lulu MillerAnd though Daniel indulged, pulling figure eights and riding beautifully as I ran beside him with my microphone, the two of them made it clear that my amazement was kind of offensive.Brian BushwaySo step right up, step right up, and see the amazing Daniel Kish do something that everybody can, but most people don't.Lulu MillerAnd here's where we get back to expectations. See, Daniel thinks there is nothing amazing about him. He thinks that most blind people who don't have other disabilities could do things like ride bikes.Daniel KishI definitely think that most blind people could move around with fluidity and confidence if that were the expectation.Lulu MillerSee, he thinks the reason that more blind people don't isn't just because they haven't learned to click. But it's because the expectations that you or I are carrying around in our own heads about what blind people can do are simply way too low.Daniel KishThey wouldn't be able to hike. They wouldn't be able to run. They wouldn't be able to engage in manual labor.Lulu MillerDaniel, like Bob, thinks those expectations, those private thoughts in our heads, are extremely powerful things, because over time, they have the ability to change the blind person we are thinking about.Daniel KishThat psychology becomes inculcated in the blind person, absorbed and translated into physical reality.Lulu MillerAnd so Daniel thinks if we could all change our expectations of what blind people are capable of, then not only would you see a lot more blind people on bikes, but--Daniel KishMore blind people could--Lulu Miller--in a very real way--Daniel Kish--see.Lulu MillerYeah, he just said "see."Daniel KishIt's actually pretty simple and straightforward.Lulu MillerAnd it turns out neuroscientists are looking into this idea and seeing some pretty shocking results. And we'll get there. But first, to understand what Daniel means, how expectations could give a blind person vision, we need to first see how Daniel himself shot through this forcefield of low expectations, a story which starts back in 1967, when Daniel was 13 months old, and that second eyeball had just been removed.Paulette KishOh, my gosh.Lulu MillerThis is Danielle's mother, Paulette Kish. And a few days after taking her son home from the hospital, Paulette realized she was facing a really difficult choice.Paulette KishMy mom thought that I should put him in cotton.Lulu MillerCotton?Paulette KishWrap him in cotton so that he didn't get hurt, so that he was so protected. That's really how she felt.Lulu MillerSee, Daniel was a very rambunctious little guy.Paulette KishHe started climbing when he was six months old, before he even walked.Lulu MillerAnd that didn't change when he went blind.Paulette KishWe had bookshelves he would climb, so I'd have to move everything off the bookshelves, because he would get into them.Lulu MillerSo Paulette needed to decide, was her mom right? Was it time to start putting some restrictions on him, or was she going to raise him like a seeing child, allow him to explore his world with very few restrictions on him for blindness? And Paulette went with option two. She was going to banish her fear.Paulette KishJust put it away. In the beginning, I think that's what I did. I just put it away.Lulu MillerAnd so, when two police officers showed up at her door--Paulette KishTwo big, huge police officers holding my child.Lulu Miller--having picked up Daniel for climbing the fence into their neighbor's yard--Paulette KishYou can't let him do that. He could fall.Lulu Miller--Paulette felt their same worries--Paulette KishIt's very scary.Lulu Miller--but didn't make Daniel stop.Daniel KishI just climbed everything I could find.Lulu MillerAnd when the elementary school called and asked her to make Daniel stop clicking--Paulette KishIt's not socially acceptable, is what they would say.Lulu Miller--Paulette said, too bad.Paulette KishHe needs to know what's around him, and that's how he does it.Lulu MillerAnd so Daniel clicked, [TONGUE CLICKING], past people doing double takes on the street, [TONGUE CLICKING], occasionally bumping into things.Daniel Kish(CHUCKLING) Yep.Paulette KishAnd then pretty soon--Lulu MillerYour blind kid is not only scaling trees and fences by himself, but using just his clicks-- not even using a cane at that point-- he's walking to school by himself, crossing busy roads, exploring his way into neighbors' driveways.Daniel KishA friend of the family had an undersized bike, and I started riding alongside this retainer wall, until I realized I didn't really need the wall and I could roll alongside the wall without having to touch the wall. And then--Paulette KishOh, goodness.Daniel KishI just could ride it.Lulu MillerHe'd have to click way more than usual.Daniel KishPeppering the environment with a barrage of clicks. [TONGUE CLICKING]Lulu MillerBut by six years old, he could do it-- ride completely comfortably on the bike.Daniel Kish[CHUCKLING]Lulu MillerAnd when neighbors would pop their heads out the door--Paulette KishHow can you let him do that?Lulu Miller--with their concerns--Distorted VoicesHow can you let him do that? How can you let him do that? How can you let him do that?Lulu Miller--she'd look at his smiling face--Daniel Kish[CHUCKLING]Lulu Miller--and think--Paulette KishHow can I not?Alix SpiegelHey, Lulu?Lulu MillerYeah, Alix?Alix SpiegelCan I cut in with a question?Lulu MillerYeah.Alix SpiegelDid he ever get hurt? Like, really hurt?Lulu MillerWell--Daniel KishI used to have this game, get to the top of our road and yell, dive bomb, and I would ride insanely fast down the road. And everyone would have to scatter. Well, one day, I did the dive bomb thing, and as I was screaming down this road, bang. I just collided into a metal light pole.Lulu MillerOy.Daniel KishBlood everywhere.Lulu MillerAnd this was not the only pole in Daniel's life. On the schoolyard, he ran into a pole and knocked out his front teeth.Daniel KishTeeth.Lulu MillerA few years after that, he ran straight into a soccer shed.Daniel KishAnd it just destroyed my whole mouth.Lulu MillerSo yeah, he got injured pretty badly a bunch of times. But the way that Paulette reacted to these injuries--Paulette KishMm-hmm.Lulu Miller--was that she always let him keep going. I mean, shortly after the bike thing, a bicycle appeared under the Christmas tree.Alix SpiegelAnd, like, I am a mother, and I think that if my kid kept showing up with his front teeth knocked out, I would begin to wonder if I had made the right choice.Lulu MillerYeah. Paulette knows it seems extreme, which brings me to the reason she decided to do this, to raise her blind kid so differently from the way that most blind kids are raised.Paulette KishIt was my first marriage. It was not a good marriage.Daniel KishMy father was an alcoholic, and he was abusive.Lulu MillerDaniel's biological father, who's now dead, would hit Paulette.Daniel KishSort of a barroom brawler type.Lulu MillerAnd he was tough with Daniel and Daniel's little brother, taught them to fight.Daniel KishAnd we had to learn to sort of take physical punishment, as it were, and be able to dish it back.Lulu MillerAnd Paulette says this is why she ended up being so hands-off with Daniel.Paulette Kish[SIGH] Everything that happens in your life has its effect, has its effect.Lulu MillerShe says that after years of feeling so small and powerless in that marriage, when she finally made it out, she vowed never to be ruled by fear again.Paulette KishI mean, there's life, and then there is living your life. There is a difference.Lulu MillerAnd the same would go for Daniel. She refused to let those scary thoughts of what could happen make her keep Daniel too close.Lulu MillerBut what if Daniel ended up being hit by a car and killed?I asked her.Lulu MillerLike, what if-- what if a car just hits and just plows him down?Paulette KishBut that could happen to anyone. That could happen to anyone. There was a group of four kids on the corner up about a block, a car went up the curb and hit them, killed two of them. It could happen to anyone.Lulu MillerAnd so bikes were bought for Christmas.Paulette KishYeah.Lulu MillerAnd tree climbing was permitted.Paulette KishOK. I'll just close my eyes.Lulu MillerAnd this blind little boy was allowed to wander the world as freely as any sighted child.Daniel KishFrom the fifth grade on, I walked to school almost every day. I had to cross major streets. I participated in extracurricular activities. I made my own breakfast. I made my own lunch.Alix SpiegelI mean, were they considered outside the norm? Did they consider themselves outside the norm?Lulu MillerI don't think they noticed it much. I don't think they thought about it much. Particularly Daniel didn't know that there was anything odd about the way he got around the world.Daniel KishUntil Adam.Adam ShaibleMy name is Adam Shaible. Excuse me for a second.Lulu MillerSo Alix?Alix SpiegelYeah.Lulu MillerThis is where the story takes a kind of complicated turn, because Adam is basically the first other blind person that Daniel ever encounters. They meet in the fifth grade, when Adam suddenly enrolls in Daniel's school.Adam ShaibleI will say, I was a rather small fellow at the time. When I was 11, 12, I was under 60 pounds.Lulu MillerWow.And Daniel was not exactly welcoming.Adam ShaibleHe just wasn't a nice-- a nice fellow.Lulu MillerDaniel said that Adam completely unnerved him because of how incapable he was of getting around on his own.Daniel KishLiterally just running into walls. I mean, he would just walk along, and his forehead would connect with a wall. And we'd be on the other side of that wall, and we would say, OK, that's Adam, he's coming, kind of thing.Lulu MillerIs that true? Was it, like, that bad?Adam ShaibleYeah.Lulu MillerAdam says he had simply never needed to get around on his own before.Adam ShaibleI went to the School for the Blind from age five to age seven.Lulu MillerAnd there, he was taken around on someone's arm almost all the time. In the lunchroom, people brought him his food. They helped him carry his books, helped him tie his shoelaces.Adam ShaibleI don't know why people did things for me. They just did.Lulu MillerAnd Daniel was baffled by Adam.Daniel KishAt the time, I had not really conceptualized blindness in that way for myself. And I just didn't understand it.Lulu MillerHe'd come home to his mom mystified.Paulette KishHe'd say, Adam can't do anything on his own.Adam ShaibleIf I got lost, I used to get terrified.Daniel KishWhy?Adam ShaibleI just-- I didn't feel safe.Daniel KishWhy?Lulu MillerAnd then what happened is that the kids at school started to mix up Daniel and Adam.Daniel KishPeople started just lumping us together as the blind kids. We were the same age.Lulu MillerYou were the blind boys.Daniel KishYeah. They'd mix up our names, and I didn't like that at all.Lulu MillerAnd so almost to prove his distinction from Adam--Daniel KishI did the things that kids will do in situations like that.Lulu MillerWhat did you do?Daniel KishUm--Paulette KishHe made fun of Adam.Lulu MillerHe started bullying him.Adam ShaibleI wondered if there was something I had done.Lulu MillerHe'd tease him in front of other kids--Daniel KishI was pretty brutal.Lulu Miller--and even beat him up a few times.Adam ShaibleYeah.Daniel KishAnd that, in my aggressive little mind, was the thing that set me apart.Adam ShaibleI wanted to be his friend.Alix SpiegelSo then what happened?Lulu MillerUm--Daniel KishTime moved on.Lulu MillerAdam and Daniel went to different schools, and Daniel just tried his best to forget this kid so like him, who couldn't get around in the world.Daniel KishAnd um, we just lost track--Adam ShaibleWe just lost track of each other.Lulu MillerDaniel goes off to college, doesn't really associate himself with the blind community. His plan is to become a researcher, an autism researcher. And then one day, he happens to pick up this book.Bob ScottThe title isTheMakingofBlindMen.Daniel KishTheMakingofBlindMenby Robert Scott.Bob ScottI go by Bob. You can spell that either way.Lulu MillerAll right.This is the book's author, Bob Scott, a former professor of sociology at Princeton. And inside this book was the idea that would change Daniel's life, an idea that when you first hear it sounds kind of out there-- that blindness is a social construction.Alix SpiegelWait, was Bob saying that people are not physically blind?Lulu MillerKind of. But let me just tell you how he gets there.Alix SpiegelOK.Lulu MillerOK?Alix SpiegelOK.Lulu MillerSo fresh out of grad school, Bob got this job to conduct a huge, multi-year long survey to see how effective blindness organizations were at helping the blind.Bob ScottYep.Lulu MillerAnd so he begins interviewing hundreds of blind people, goes out on hundreds of site visits.Bob ScottBasically gathering information in any way I could imagine that I could get it.Lulu MillerAnd then one day, many months into the process, he had--Bob ScottWhat might be called an aha moment.Lulu MillerHe was out walking in a snowstorm in New York City, when he happened to see--Bob ScottA blind beggar--Lulu Miller--asking for money--Bob Scott--standing on the corner at Bloomingdale's.Lulu MillerAnd he thought, hey, someone else to interview for my survey.Bob ScottI said, would you allow me to buy some of your time? And I gave him-- I don't know-- $25 or something like that. We went in and sat down at a restaurant, and I said, tell me your story.Lulu MillerTurns out the man had worked at a paint factory until a few years before, when an accident there left him blind. And the people at the factory really liked the guy, so they said, look, why don't you go to an organization for the blind, get some training, and then come back and work for us? So the guy said, great.He went to an organization for the blind. He said, I've got this job all lined up. Can you just help me with a few basic things. And the blindness organization said no.Bob ScottOh, no. You can't do that. Blind people can't do those things. What we're going to do is put you through a program of rehabilitation and then move you along to our sheltered workshop that manufactures mops and brooms.Lulu MillerAnd Bob said there was one sentence in that response that jumped out at him.Bob ScottBlind people can't do those things.Lulu MillerAnd he began to wonder, wait, is that true? Could this guy really not work in a paint factory? Because over the course of his research, he'd seen blind people that could do all sorts of things. And the more that Bob looked around, he started to see that message--Bob ScottBlind people can't do those things.Lulu Miller--being communicated to the blind people by the blind organizations that serve them-- not necessarily always as explicitly as in the case of the paint guy.Alix SpiegelLike, how else then?Lulu MillerWell, take the fact that at that time, of the almost 20,000 blind kids that were in America, 2/3 of them were being kept on the sidelines in gym class. Play tag, run around on your own--Bob ScottBlind people can't do those things.Lulu MillerAnd then there was the organization's insistence that adult blind people get help getting around.Bob ScottThey are picked up at their homes. They're driven there. They're met at the sidewalk, walked into the agency, escorted to wherever they're going-- everything is being done for them.Lulu MillerAnd even though all this was intended to help, Bob began to wonder if maybe, just maybe, the organizations' low expectations for what blind people could do was in some way actually limiting the blind people that those organizations sought to help.Bob ScottWhat I came to realize is that how they functioned was a process of learning. It was not imposed on them entirely by the fact that they couldn't see.Alix SpiegelHey, Lulu?Lulu MillerYeah, Alix?Alix SpiegelSo is Bob saying that blindness is mostly in our head? That blind people can actually do everything that sighted people can do? Because my dad is blind, and he is very, very limited in what he can do. And I gotta say, I don't feel like the obstacles that he faces are obstacles that he wouldn't face if he just thought differently about his blindness.Lulu MillerWell, Bob is pretty hardcore about this. I think he would say that with enough time, your dad actually could do a lot more, because he thinks the only real absolute physical limitation of blindness is about an inability to perceive things in the distance.Bob ScottExactly, anything that I can't reach out and touch.Lulu MillerBut you can compensate for everything else. And Alix?Alix SpiegelUh-huh?Lulu MillerBob wasn't actually the first person to come up with this idea. Blind people were. A group called the National Federation of the Blind has for a long time advocated this kind of idea. This is a group formed by blind people for blind people, and they think that the physical condition of blindness--Bob ScottIt doesn't explain nearly as much as people believe it explains.Alix SpiegelSo if you buy this logic, people who are blind-- like, the only thing that's standing between them and walking around the world, like Daniel does, is our beliefs?Lulu MillerYeah. You know, that sounds totally crazy, and that is exactly what he's saying. Which brings us back to Daniel. Daniel reads this book, and he starts thinking about Adam.Adam ShaibleIf I got lost, I used to get terrified.Lulu MillerYou know, maybe it wasn't that Adam was this weirdo, tentative kid but that he was a very typical product of a system.Alix SpiegelYou mean, like, the system taught Adam that he would have trouble moving around.Lulu MillerYeah. I mean, he was led around school. People brought him his food--Adam ShaibleI don't know why people did things for me. They just did.Lulu MillerAnd when Daniel looked at the world around him, he thought, you know, a lot has changed. But a lot is frighteningly similar.Alix SpiegelFrom then till today, things are similar?Daniel KishYeah.Lulu MillerYeah.Daniel KishYeah.Lulu MillerI called around to over a dozen blindness organizations all over the country.Daniel NorrisMy name is Daniel Norris, supervisor of adult services for the Vermont Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired.Lulu MillerAnd supervisor after supervisor told me that what Bob Scott saw is still very much alive today.Alix SpiegelIn what way?Lulu MillerSo most children who are blind in America don't actually go to schools for the blind anymore.Daniel NorrisRight.Lulu MillerThanks to the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, most blind kids stay in their local public schools, which is great. But on those public school grounds, says Norris--Daniel NorrisThere is a lot of pressure to keep a child safe, especially in a litigious society.Lulu MillerSo many of the blind students are still placed with a paraeducator, which can be good. But sometimes--Daniel NorrisThose paraeducators can end up doing the work for the kids.Lulu MillerLike Adam.Daniel NorrisWhen you lighten someone's load, you don't allow them to expand.Lulu MillerI talked to mothers whose blind kids were pulled off of playground equipment. And perhaps the most chilling thing is the fact that most blind kids will intuitively start clicking--Daniel Kish[TONGUE CLICKING]Lulu Miller--or snapping or stamping to test out their environment with sound. But they are so often discouraged--Paulette KishIt's not socially acceptable, is what they would say.Lulu Miller--that they never get the chance to develop their skill to the level Daniel did.Daniel NorrisSo how are we doing as a nation? We have not taught independence.Lulu MillerHe points out that in America, a majority of blind people are unemployed. And while that could be for a lot of reasons, Norris thinks that's on us.Daniel KishWhat we are doing is we are creating slaves to others' thinking.Lulu MillerThat's Daniel Kish again.Daniel KishSlaves to others' perception, slaves to what others think they should be doing. And somehow we're comfortable with that.Lulu MillerAnd so, though he had never wanted to work in the profession of blindness-- in fact, he'd wanted to get as far away from it as he could-- Daniel Kish decided he sort of had no choice.Daniel KishIt sucked me in kind of kicking and screaming.Lulu MillerHe could see what was happening. And he held in his tongue, [TONGUE CLICKING], a way out. So he decided that he would dedicate his life to trying to liberate blind children.Alix SpiegelKind of like Batman?Lulu MillerExactamundo, fighting for good in the world in a kind of vigilante way, because actually, the way that you go about liberating a blind child from the constraining forces of culture, it can get kind of ugly.Ira GlassComing up, the Dark Knight rises. Lulu and Alix are back in a minute, from Chicago Public Radio, when our program continues.Act Two: The Dark Knight RisesIra GlassIt'sThisAmericanLife. I'm Ira Glass. Today on our program, we have a story from a brand new radio show and podcast calledInvisibilia. It's from NPR News. Science reporters Alix Spiegel and Lulu Miller are the hosts. And they're here today talking about how profoundly other people's expectations can affect us and about a blind man named Daniel Kish. Anyway, again, here's Alix.Alix SpiegelSo when last we met Daniel, he had decided that he was going to become a kind of real-life Batman who would save people who were blind from the low expectations of their culture. But before we keep going, I should probably point out that lots of blind people don't necessarily want him as their savior. A bunch of them told us, basically, clicks shmicks!Bob RingwaldBecause I get along just fine without doing that clicking noise, or whatever he calls it.Alix SpiegelThis is Bob Ringwald, a musician in California. He says he's got a cane. It works great. He does everything he wants.Bob RingwaldWhen I wanted to learn guitar, I did, and I've done a lot of climbing around on my roof and climbing up poles. And anything I wanted to do, I did.Alix SpiegelNow, Bob Ringwald-- in fact, all of the blind people that we spoke to for this story-- agreed with Daniel that low expectations hold blind people back. But that didn't necessarily mean that they wanted to echolocate. For example, when Bob Ringwald was seven, in school for the blind back in the '50s, he knew some kids who clicked and said they just seemed a little weird.Bob RingwaldI really didn't want to go through life clicking all the time. A lot of people think blind people are strange. So I didn't want to be any stranger than I already was.Eric WoodsA lot of instructors don't like people to do that, because it does look funny.Alix SpiegelEric Woods is also blind, and a retired mobility instructor in Colorado.Eric WoodsAnd it's socially unacceptable-- not unacceptable, but it's socially different. And so it has been discouraged. I've heard plenty of people discourage it.Alix SpiegelAnd Daniel knew this. He knew what he was up against. So Lulu, what did Daniel do?Lulu MillerWell, he starts up a nonprofit, as you do-- a nonprofit that will teach people how to echolocate.Voice On VideoGrace.Lulu MillerThis is one of his early instructional videos. It's now 2001, and since his aim is nothing short of liberation, he calls it World Access for the Blind.Voice On VideoWorld Access for the Blind.Lulu MillerNow, the only little problem that he runs into is that at that time, a blind person teaching another blind person how to get around is basically unheard of.Daniel KishThe blind cannot lead the blind is right out of the Bible. It's fundamental to our culture.Lulu MillerIn fact, until the mid '90s--Daniel KishThere was no certification for blind people to train other blind people.Alix SpiegelWow.Bob ScottBlind people can't do those things.Lulu MillerSo this is actually when the bike trick became big-- like, though he sort of hates "Look at the blind man ride a bike," he realized that could get him attention. So he starts going on all these TV shows with his trick.Daniel KishAnd my segment was between something about vampires and some other thing about faith healing or whatever.Lulu MillerAnd on these TV appearances, he'd try to send some sort of signal to blind kids who might be watching, who might be able to contact him.[APPLAUSE]Tv HostDan, can anyone learn this?Daniel KishEcholocation is a skill-- piano playing, for example. Some people may be more talented than others, but I think that anyone could learn it.Lulu MillerAnd it worked.Daniel KishYeah.Lulu MillerSlowly but surely, families started contacting him, which meant that Daniel was now faced with a question. Could he actually undo the damage of low expectations? And this is where things begin to get a little morally complicated.Daniel KishThe example I'm about to give is an example that took place about 10 years ago.Lulu MillerDaniel told me about going out to teach one of his first students ever, a little 10-year-old boy.Daniel KishHe lives on an apple orchard--Lulu MillerOut in Washington state.Daniel KishI come out. And basically, what I see is a boy who won't leave his house.Lulu MillerAnd so Daniel's idea was to get him to climb a tree.Daniel KishThey live on an orchard full of trees, for goodness' sakes.Lulu MillerBut the kid won't budge. So to get him out the door, Daniel takes away all his toys.Daniel KishOur purpose was to kind of simulate the world that he was choosing for himself. So this is what life will have in store for you-- basically nothing, OK? Nothing.Lulu MillerAnd after about a week, the kid finally agrees to go climb a frickin' tree. And he gets up onto the first branch and the second branch and then says, OK.Daniel KishI give up. I give up. Yeah, but you know what? Giving up isn't an option. You can decide never to climb a tree for the rest of your life, but we are going to climb this one. And I said, you can go up, you cannot go down. And he just had a fit-- literally screaming himself hoarse. I mean, he actually jumped at one point. Like, he actually leapt off the tree, he was in such a frenzy.Alix SpiegelOh my god, Lulu. And what does Daniel do?Lulu MillerWell, he catches him. He's right below him. And he just says, no.Daniel KishYou can go up. You cannot go down.Lulu MillerAnd they stay in this tree battling it out.Daniel KishInch by inch by-- it took three hours to get up a 60-foot tree.Lulu MillerBut by the end, the kid was doing it himself.Daniel Kish--doing it himself. He started finding his own footholds, finding his own handholds.Lulu MillerAnd Daniel thinks this training and how the parents then took it on too changed the boy's life.Daniel KishBy the age of 13, he was out of his shell. He had joined Boy Scouts. That is in no way where he was headed.Alix SpiegelHm. That is just crazy, though, that story, on some level. I don't know if that kind of bullying is even allowed in America anymore, you know?Lulu MillerYeah. And most schools for the blind have been reluctant to hire him because of liability issues. They're scared it'll be too dangerous for their students.Alix SpiegelI bet.Lulu MillerBut see, Daniel would say that attitude, Alix, is part of the problem. So what are a few tears, huh, a few scratches? He has this line he always says.Daniel KishRunning into a pole is a drag. But never being allowed to run into a pole is a disaster.Lulu MillerHe worries that when you prevent a kid from, say, running into a pole, what you end up preventing them from is the kind of experience that allow for-- and this gets me back to that crazy sounding claim he made at the beginning of the show-- actual sight.Daniel KishIf our culture recognized the capacity of blind people to see, then more blind people would learn to see. It's actually pretty simple and straightforward.Lulu MillerDaniel thinks this because, well, he says he sees.Daniel KishI definitely would say that I experience images, that I have images.Lulu MillerAnd he isn't talking metaphorically here.Daniel KishThey are images of spatial character and depth that have a lot of the same qualities that a person who sees would see.Lore ThalerHello?Lulu MillerHi.Lore ThalerHi.Lulu MillerThis is Lore Thaler, a German neuroscientist at Durham University in the UK. And Lore knows a lot about sight. She studies vision in the brain-- literally how the images we see are constructed.Lore ThalerIt sounds simple, but an image is actually a complex construct.Lulu MillerSeveral years ago, Lore happened across a video of Daniel.Daniel KishOK, so we had a little string of parked vehicles there--Lulu MillerAnd as she watched the way that he so easily moved through space, she found herself wondering, was there any way that Daniel's brain was indeed constructing images?Lore ThalerIt was so akin to vision, really.Lulu MillerOK, so you may know this already, but Lore reminded me that an image, even though it feels like it's out there in the world in front of your eyes actually exists behind the eyes.Lore ThalerThe image, it's something that your mind constructs.Lulu MillerIn a part of your brain called the visual cortex. So Lore brought Daniel and a few other people who can echolocate into her lab, and she took recordings of them while they clicked at different objects in space.Daniel Kish[TONGUE CLICKING]Lulu MillerA car, a lamppost-- these are her actual recordings-- a salad bowl, a salad bowl in motion.Alix SpiegelHow do you get a salad bowl in motion?Lulu MillerYou stand behind the person with a salad bowl on a fishing pole, and you slowly wave it.Alix SpiegelRight.Lulu MillerAnd the microphones were actually in their ears.Lore ThalerSo we recorded what they heard exactly.Alix SpiegelOh, that's neat.Lulu MillerAnd then she played the recordings back to them, one object at a time, while they were lying down in fMRI machines, so she could watch how their brains responded. [TONGUE CLICKING] Salad bowl. [TONGUE CLICKING] Salad bowl in motion.And then in a second study, she compared those readings to what happens in the brains of sighted people looking at the same kinds of things. Salad bowl. Salad bowl in motion.Alix SpiegelVery clever, very clever.Lulu MillerYep. And what she found is that even though for decades scientists assumed that the visual cortex goes dark when you are blind, Daniel's was lighting up like a disco ball.Lore ThalerYeah, so that was really very impressive.Lulu MillerAnd the way in which it was lighting up-- this is really cool. So it turns out that there are all these different parts of the brain involved in vision. So there's an area that's specifically dedicated to processing motion, and that's way over here behind the ears. And then there's a completely different area for texture--Lore ThalerLightness, so how bright is something.Lulu Miller--orientation, shape. And in Daniel's brain, many of these areas were lighting up. Color and brightness, no action there. But motion, when they did that salad bowl in motion test, the motion area behind the ears started pumping with blood flow.Lore ThalerVery vigorously.Lulu MillerAnd orientation-- turns out there's sort of a grid for orientation in the brain. And she could watch as the salad bowl moved across those quadrants.Lore ThalerIt was really robust, highly significant.Lulu MillerAll right, Miss Spiegel. So I know that sometimes neurology and neuroscience--Alix SpiegelGoes over my head?Lulu MillerOr just sounds like a foreign language that you're not particularly interested in speaking.Alix SpiegelUh-huh. Just land the plane for me. What does this mean?Lulu MillerWhat this work suggests is that you may not actually need eyes to see.Lulu MillerI kind of feel like we've got to shout it from the rooftops. Come on.Alix SpiegelOh my god.Lulu MillerOK. You might not need eyes to see!Now, Lore is by no means the only person seeing this result. The idea first started coming up in the mid '90s, when a lab at Harvard saw that visual areas of the brain can be activated by sound and touch.Alix SpiegelDo I have to do it?Lulu MillerUh-huh.Alix SpiegelYou might not need eyes to see!Lulu MillerAnd since then, dozens of labs have been looking into just how nuanced and rich that visual imagery may be. So there's a guy at Berkeley, Santani Teng, who's been trying to determine the acuity of these images. You know, like an eye test-- how close to 20/20 are they?Alix SpiegelUh-huh.Lulu MillerAnd what he's found is that their 75% localization thresholds indicated spatial acuity as fine as 1.5 degrees of the subtended angle.Alix SpiegelNo!Lulu MillerIt's true! I'll put it another way. He thinks their world looks a lot like your peripheral vision. So imagine that you're texting on your cellphone walking down the street. OK, you're looking at that screen. Now, what does the street look like to you?You know, you can see people coming at you. You can see cars. You can see trees. But you couldn't read a sign. That, he thinks, is Daniel's world.Daniel KishI can honestly, honestly say that I do not feel blind.Alix SpiegelSo what does Lore say about this? Does she think that the echolocators are actually seeing?Lulu MillerWell--Lore ThalerThat's almost philosophical, isn't it?Lulu MillerLore asks the only people on Earth who can know-- people who use to see. You know, is what they're experiencing comparable?Brian BushwayYeah, oh yeah.Lulu MillerThis is Brian Bushway, who you met briefly at the top of the show.Brian BushwaySo step right up!I became totally blind at the age of 14.Lulu MillerBut once he learned echolocation--Brian BushwayJust [SNAP] like that!Lulu Miller--the world around him, although blurrier and colorless, appeared again.Brian BushwayThings are real. I mean, it's as real as looking at it.Alix SpiegelWait, wait, wait. So Lulu, does every blind person have this?Lulu MillerNo. And that's the thing-- Lore has looked at the brains of people who do not echolocate, and though there's definitely some activity in the visual cortex, it's simply not as active. Which brings me back to Daniel's teaching methods. The thing about echolocation is, yes, you can learn it when you get older. But it gets so much harder with age, which is why Daniel doesn't give a damn about making a little kid cry, because he thinks at the other end of those tears is sight.Daniel KishOK, off we go.Lulu MillerSo I finally got to see one of these training sessions in action. We went to see a five-year-old boy named Nathan Nip.Daniel KishOK, so what we'll do then is we'll ask Nathan's mom about parks or some place that he doesn't know.Lulu MillerBrian's with us too, actually. He's now one of Daniel's deputy teachers.Daniel KishHe can click.Lulu MillerAnd part of the goal that day was to get Nathan out of his comfort zone. But the bigger part-- and really, what is often this other major part of what Daniel is trying to teach-- is to get the people around Nathan to back off.Daniel KishHello?GodmotherHi!Lulu MillerSo we go into the house.Nathan NipI am five and a half, and Ashton's two.Lulu MillerDaniel asks to hear Nathan's clicks.Nathan Nip[TONGUE CLICKING]Daniel KishYou have a nice smiley click.Lulu MillerAnd then we head out to a faraway park.Brian BushwayWhere are we? Where do you think we are?Nathan NipAt the field!Brian BushwayAt the field.Lulu MillerDing, ding, ding. It's a sports field flanked by a really busy road.Brian BushwayNathan? Nathan?Lulu MillerAnd the idea is to make Nathan find his way around this park by himself.Brian BushwaySo we want to use our, [TONGUE CLICKING], our clicks. And we're going to explore what's around here in this park. Let's see if we can find anything, OK?Nathan NipYeah.Brian BushwayOK.Lulu MillerSo he finds a soccer net.Brian BushwayYeah.Lulu MillerHe tries to find a fence at one side of the park--Brian BushwayWell, you're-- yeah, we're in the bushes.Lulu Miller--but gets a little turned around.Brian BushwayCome back toward me. Nathan, come back toward me.Lulu MillerAnd then it's time to find the edge of the road.Brian BushwayWhat noises do we hear right now?Nathan NipCars?Brian BushwayCars.Lulu MillerSo Brian tells Nathan to walk toward those cars.Brian BushwayAnd we'll all follow behind you.Lulu MillerAt this point, it's just me and the godmother and Brian.Nathan NipWhere's Ashton?Brian BushwayHe's over there.Lulu MillerEveryone else is on the other side of the park.Nathan NipCan we please go to him?Brian BushwayNo.Nathan NipWhy?Lulu MillerNathan is leading.Brian BushwayCan I hear you click?Nathan Nip[TONGUE CLICKING].Lulu MillerAnd picture this-- I mean, this is, like, a little five-year-old boy with a tiny white cane--Alix SpiegelKind of tapping his way towards oncoming traffic?Lulu MillerTapping his way toward oncoming traffic, which is a jarring sight. And the person closest to him is Brian, who is also blind.Brian BushwayListen out in front of you. Listen into the distance.Lulu MillerAnd he's getting closer and closer to the edge of the road. Four feet, three feet, and then--[CAR APPROACHING][SILENCE]--his godmother just shoots out and grabs him back. And Brian kind of noticeably flinched.Brian BushwayLet's try to stay, like, more  or less behind him.Lulu MillerBecause while he completely understands why the godmother would reach out for Nathan, he said it is precisely that kind of moment that does the damage.Brian BushwayOften sighted people will jump in a half a second too soon, and they rob the blind student from that learning moment. And that just keeps happening over and over again, and I think so many blind people's lives, they never get that moment of what it is to really have that self-confidence to trust your senses to know, oh, if I do use my cane properly and I am listening attentively to information around me, I'll be OK.Lulu MillerI think part of the problem is that when we have eyes, we can see things coming from further away. The whole point is, like, when it's your cane and you're clicking, you catch edges at what appears like the last moment.Brian BushwayWe don't need to go any farther. Why? Why don't we need to go any further?Nathan Nip'Cause there's cars.Brian BushwayYeah, so it means the street's here.Nathan Nip[TONGUE CLICKING].Alix SpiegelCan I ask  you a question?Lulu MillerMm-hmm.Alix SpiegelWhat if you're a half-second too late?Lulu MillerRight.Alix SpiegelBecause I think that probably a lot of parents-- I mean, the thing that keeps them reaching out well before the half-second before is kind of the specter of the half-second after.Lulu MillerSo I think you grabbed him there.GodmotherYeah, yeah, yeah.Lulu MillerAnd what was that moment like?Well, this is exactly what Nathan's godmother brought up.GodmotherIt is hard.Lulu MillerShe understands the dangers of a half-second too early.GodmotherHe has to learn how to make that judgment.Lulu MillerBut at the end of the day, she is far more concerned about the dangers of the half-second too late.GodmotherYou don't really want to risk that.Lulu MillerWhich brings me to possibly the biggest thing that Daniel is up against in his quest to change expectations-- love.Daniel NorrisYou can't blame mom and dad for struggling and wanting to keep their child safe.Lulu MillerThis is Dan Norris again from the blindness organization in Vermont. And when we asked him if a change like the one Daniel's hoping for, a massive change in expectations, could actually take place, one of the main obstacles he brought up was love.Daniel NorrisIt's very hard as a parent with a child who's visually impaired to let go.Lulu MillerEven when the expectations for that kid are high, he said love can get in the way.Daniel NorrisThose parents, they want to keep their child safe. They want their child to not suffer. And that's very noble but holds the kids back.Lulu MillerSo in 10 years in the field, how many kids on bikes have you seen, blind kids on bikes?Daniel KishBlind kids on bikes? I have seen about five.Lulu MillerThat's actually pretty good.Daniel KishYeah, I think that we are seeing society begin to change.Lulu MillerBut when he thinks about the sheer volume of love, brimming in every household on every schoolyard and every street corner--Daniel KishAre we going to get there any time soon as a nation? Um, no. I don't think so.Lulu MillerAnd this gets us finally to what may have been Daniel's one true superpower.Daniel KishWhat most people find to be the meaning of life absolutely creeps me out.Lulu MillerDaniel is 49 and has never been with a partner. And he finds the whole idea of physical intimacy--Daniel KishUnsettling.Lulu MillerWe had finally reached the end of our hike, the place Daniel wanted to take me.Daniel KishIs this, like, awesome?Lulu MillerYeah.It was a huge old oak tree, miles from civilization, that Daniel said was one of his favorite spots on Earth.Daniel KishOK.Lulu MillerAnd so we climbed up it together.Daniel KishLet's see where I would go.Lulu Miller20 feet, 30 feet, maybe 40 feet.Lulu MillerYou're very high!And it was there in the branches that he told me he's never really been one for love.Daniel KishI was never that interested in closeness as a kid. I wasn't really a lap-sitter. I didn't like holding hands. I didn't really like hugs.Lulu MillerHe even used to have nightmares about it.Daniel KishA child's mind will turn things into very ghoulish, ghastly, deeply unsettling, spooky things.Lulu MillerLike what? Like, what would be a nightmare about--Daniel KishThere were two.Lulu MillerIn one, a hand chased after him.Daniel KishAnd then the other thing were the plastic arms that want to sort engulf and unfold and just kind of take you in to themselves.Lulu MillerHe's not sure where this comes from. He wonders if it could have been the surgeries he had as a tiny boy or from the way his parents raised him. Or maybe he just always was that way.Daniel KishWho knows?Lulu MillerAnd while he's not suggesting that you need this quality to become independent, when he looks back, he wonders if this may have been one of the things that protected him from the debilitating effects of low expectations. Because unlike the rest of us, when those arms reached out for him, he never once had any desire to fall back into them.Paulette KishEverything that happens in your life has its effect.Lulu MillerThat's his mom again, Paulette.Paulette KishHas its effect.Lulu MillerAnd you don't think it's that Daniel became this way because he was in some way neglected or because it was too hard? Is there any part of you that thinks you went too far in terms of letting him be?Paulette KishNo. No. He's happy.Daniel KishTotally happy.Lulu MillerWe sat there for a while, watching the afternoon slip away.Daniel KishListen to how quiet it is.Lulu MillerAnd suddenly I got that pang you get when you realize it's getting dark, and you are far, far from civilization. And that was followed by another pang that it literally didn't matter, because he'd be the one leading us out.Daniel Kish[TONGUE CLICKING] That's amazing.Lulu MillerYeah.Daniel Kish[TONGUE CLICKING][MUSIC - "BATMAN THEME" BY NEIL HEFTI]Ira GlassLulu Miller and Alix Spiegel ofInvisibilia, the new public radio program and podcast.
