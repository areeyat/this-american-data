Right now, we're going to be a little bit quiet, because--[CHILD WHINING]--we're going to have a family talk. Are you ready for a family talk?ChildWait, wait, wait, wait, Dad.BryanWhat?Ira GlassBryan LeBaron is dad of a big family, seven kids in all. He mostly grew up in the United States, but his father and most of his family is Mexican. And he moved back there a few years ago.Back in November, he gathered everybody together for a family meeting outside on a patio. Most of the kids were in a long bench, holding pillows.BryanLexie thinks that this is an important moment in our family, and I agree with her.Ira GlassLexie is Lexie Harrison-Cripps, the journalist that recorded this meeting. Because she knew what some of the kids did not know-- that Bryan was planning to run for a seat in Mexico's House of Representatives.ChildWhat does that mean?BryanI want to work for the government. That's what that means. And since I'm going to be running, it's going to be a lot of work for me, and I'm going to be traveling a lot. I'm going to be away from home a lot.And when we go places, people are going to want pictures. So maybe you're walking with me, and somebody will take a picture of us. We don't know how--FernandoI'm gonna be famous![LAUGHTER]BryanWe don't know exactly what that's going to be like, right? But one of the things also is that because of certain things that happened in our family, now there's people in our town that may not want to vote for me. And it might even cause people to want to be mean to our family. OK? And so I wanted to have a talk-- Mom and I wanted to have a talk with you so that you can be ready.Ira GlassNot just ready for the campaign, which is months away, but he's called his family meeting right now, in November, because something's come up that's not only going to affect his candidacy but everyone in the family in the next few days. What's happened is that Macario, their 17-year-old, has just made a big, public declaration on Instagram, telling the world that he's gay, which in some places would be, like, whatever.But this family is Mormon, living in a tight-knit fundamentalist community in Mexico. Macario and the other kids go to a fundamentalist Mormon school that very much disapproves of homosexuality. Bryan figured kids at school might start saying cruel and hateful stuff to Macario and his brothers and sisters. Already, some classmates were posting pretty awful comments on Instagram. Bryan wanted all of his children to be prepared.BryanOK, guys, so guess what? You know how a lot of times we always went to church and we always hear about people that are going to date and get married?Ira GlassThree of the kids listening to this are young. There's nine-year-old Ahriella, seven-year-old Chanel, and four-year-old Franco. And what that means is that before Bryan can tell them "your brother is gay," he first has to explain "gay," the whole idea of gayness, to these little kids.BryanChanel, this is more for you and Ahriella, OK? Have you guys ever heard of the term "gay"?Child 1A what?BryanGay.Child 1Oh, yeah.BryanWhat does it mean?Child 2Gay means--BryanYeah.Child 2--like, people that, like, wear necklaces that are meant for girls.BryanSo boys that wear necklaces that are for girls?Ira GlassGood guess, he tells them--BryanThat's OK.Ira Glass--and then launches into his explanation. He keeps it simple.BryanBut when people say the word "gay," usually it means either two boys that like each other--Child 2I knew it.Bryan--and maybe even one day want to get married, or two girls that like each other and that maybe even want to get married. And somebody who feels that way, just like I look at Mom and I think she's beautiful, there can be boys that look at other boys and think they're beautiful. OK? Does that make sense?Ira GlassIt's yes all around.BryanOK.Ira GlassOn to the big reveal.BryanWell, guess what? Macario-- he thinks that boys are beautiful, and he thinks that he wants to fall in love with a boy. OK? And that's what people call "gay."Child 1Mm-hmm.BryanOK? Now, that doesn't mean that something's wrong with Macario. Macario is perfect just the way that he is, and we love him and we're always going to love him.Child 2But why do they call it "gay"?BryanThat's just the name they gave it. Why do they call boys "boys" and girls "girls"? There's just a name for everything.Ira GlassI should say that two years ago, this is not how Bryan would have talked about being gay. He was raised to believe that it was a choice and sinful. When Macario came out to him, Macario explained that he had already tried to pray and fast his way out of being gay, and it was impossible.And Bryan believed him. He changed how he saw all of it. And as he talks about Macario with the family, Macario is sitting exactly in between his two little sisters as they learn what "gay" means. He smiles, like a mystery contestant on an old-timey game show whose secret identity was just revealed.MacarioI didn't really know what was going on.Ira GlassAnd did your dad tell you, OK, here's what we're going to explain to the kids in this meeting?MacarioNope. It was just, I was going to say I was gay, and it literally-- it was not very planned out.Ira GlassThis, of course, is Macario. He says it felt good to hear his dad say all these things in front of everybody. Next, Bryan explained to the little ones in the family the kids in school might be pretty mean about Macario, and we'll need to be ready.BryanWhen people say, oh, your brother is gay, he's going to go to the devil, oh, ha, ha--Child 1I will say--BryanHa, ha, ha--Child 1I will say--BryanThat's what people will say--Child 1--that's not true.LindiHey, listen.BryanWell, that what's not true? That Macario is gay?Child 1No, that he's going to go to the devil.BryanSo I want you to be ready because little kids can be mean sometimes.Child 1Yeah, I know.Child 2No!Ira GlassMacario tells them about some of the mean things that kids have said at school. There was this one kid.MacarioTheir dad said they can't do anything to legally kick me out of the town, but they can do everything in their power to make it so that I want to leave on my own. And they just only did that and are doing that because I'm gay. That's the only reason. And I know that they're just doing that because they've been told their whole life that I'm a terrible-- that anyone is a terrible person if they're gay.So I mean, I get where they're coming from. But like, when they started just saying shit-- I mean, started saying stuff about our friends-- my friends and the people supporting me and then you guys-- like how that guy said that. He was like, no, we can't blame the devil for this. It's their parents' fault. They raised him wrong. They lived in California, Western culture or whatever.When they said that, it just made me so bothered because I'm like, I don't know. You can get mad at me and you can think that I'm this or that, but all these people who are supporting me--Ira GlassSo everybody's on the same page, all prepared. Macario is feeling great about it.Child 1I think it's time for bed.BryanYou got that right. OK. I want a hug.Ira GlassAnd when they go to school after this prep, none of the things that Bryan prepared them for happened. The school made a rule that nobody could talk about Macario. Overall, most of the Mormon community continued to treat Macario like they always had.All this was a little sad for nine-year-old Ahriella, who marched into school ready to tussle, to defend her beloved brother after the family meeting.BryanShe said, well, I walked into class and I just said, hi, everybody, how's it going? Anything new happen yesterday? And they're like, no. And so she said, well, how about the day before? No, nothing new. And she said, hmm, OK.(LAUGHING) So she just went about her day. So I don't know. It didn't seem to phase the younger kids at school. It was more Macario's classmates. I think the teenagers just maybe shocked by it and not understanding exactly what to think.Ira GlassIn fact, some teenagers set off a pretty frightening array of firecrackers at their house and threw rocks wrapped in pieces of paper with Macario's name written on them, which was scary. Kids and adults posted comments online, like "Macario should find a tall tree and a rope, should die." Bryan and his wife Lindi took all the kids out of the Mormon school.But the family had been prepped. They understood that people might get mad about Macario. And inside the family, the family meeting set the tone. It was a preemptive strike that made Macario's gayness a non-issue, a non-negotiable fact.BryanThey really have had little-- not many questions since then. It seemed to really not phase them at all. It was just, OK, you know, that's cool. What are we going to do tomorrow? [LAUGHS]Ira GlassCan we have a snack? Is there ice cream?BryanThat's it, exactly.Ira GlassWell, today on our program, the power of a family meeting to drop some news-- like your brother's gay-- or the classic one people remember, I guess-- we're getting a divorce. And then there are the administrative family meetings where parents announce some changes in how we do the dishes around here or take out the garbage or whatever, and everybody's going to be doing their fair share.What a family meeting can and cannot accomplish, especially in families where the kids do not want to go with the parents' plan, that's our show today. Stay with us.Act One: A Slow Decision Process That’s Mostly But Maybe Not Completely OverIra GlassAct 1-- A Slow Decision Process That's Mostly But Maybe Not Completely Over. Sometimes when there's a family decision, the family can keep talking about it for months, on and off-- in the car, at meals, whenever-- with everybody weighing in with different points of view. Over the last few months, I've been talking to the parents in one family like that. Back when I first chatted with them in December, I asked the dad in the family how often the topic comes up.LotanWe are talking about that almost in each minute of the day. Even right now, before you called, we were talking about what we're going to do.Ira GlassThis is Lotan Pinyan. What he's talking about with his wife Michal is, where are they going to live next? They're a youngish couple in Israel with three kids-- 9, 11, and 13 at the time of this conversation. Both educators, he's head of development, building a school and a campus for Bedouins, nomadic Arab tribes. And Michal--MichalI'm an educational counselor.LotanNo, she's a doctor of education. OK? She's a doctor of education.Ira GlassLotan, why do you feel like you have to jump in and say that?LotanBecause we can end the conversation without you to know that she's really a doctor.Ira GlassLotan is, perhaps you can tell, somebody who's always quick to speak his mind, sure of what he thinks. Michal's more deliberative. They used to live in a kibbutz in Israel, Kibbutz Be'eri on the border with Gaza. When Hamas crossed that border on October 7, like so many families, they hid in the safe room in their house.Dozens of their neighbors were killed, more at Be'eri than at any kibbutz that day-- 1 in 10 people, including Michal's parents. And when it was over, they and most everyone else from the kibbutz were relocated to a tourist hotel by the Dead Sea, an hour-and-a-half drive from their old home in the Gaza border.MichalThe whole kibbutz is here. The hotel is closed just for our kibbutz. There's no guests from outside.LotanWe are talking about something like 1,000 people inside this hotel. You have a lot of discussions just in the lobby.Ira GlassDiscussions about where they're all going to live next. In December when we first talked, it was just two months after the attack. And each family had to decide, would they stay with the community? Would they ever want to return to the kibbutz where they'd just gone through this traumatic assault?LotanIt's 1,000 people. You have a lot of ideas. You have those people who want to stay together wherever the kibbutz will go, and those who say no.Ira GlassLots of people, especially the older people, were sure they wanted to go back and rebuild. People with kids were all over the place. And leaving a kibbutz, quitting kibbutz life, is a big deal. A kibbutz is a special kind of tight-knit community.Kibbutzim were originally set up as collective farms on socialist principles, and Be'eri is still run on the old-school socialist ideals most kibbutzim in Israel have abandoned. For example, as a member of the kibbutz, you turn over every cent that you earn at your job, your entire paycheck, to the collective.MichalBut the kibbutz gives us everything we need.Ira GlassAnd that means everything. They give you a house to live in, cars to drive, full health care, a gym and a swimming pool, and a dining hall, if you don't want to cook, and spending money for necessities but also for fun stuff like family vacations, to cover your kids' school and college. Children spend all day every day with other kids their age. It's a great way to raise kids. They can roam around. Michal describes what's so nice about kibbutz life this way.MichalYou don't have any worries-- you know, mortgage or payments. And you have a very strong community that makes you feel you belong to something big.Ira GlassMichal grew up this way on this kibbutz and loved it. Lotan moved to Be'eri with her when they first got together. He chafed at some of the rules at first, but got used to life in this big extended family. Now, after October 7, here he was with all of them at this hotel, figuring out what to do next.LotanAnd you know, it's a hotel. It's a nice place for three days of vacation, but it's not a way of living. You know, to see the smallest one go to sleep at something like midnight and--MichalYou don't have a family environment.Ira GlassMichal and Lotan were in one hotel room. The three kids were cooped up in another, getting on each other's nerves and into each other's hair. It's hard to be a family in that scattered situation.It was hard to supervise the kids. They were gone all day at work. Michal now had a 90-minute commute each way to and from her job. There was school for the kids, but it was a makeshift thing the kibbutz organized, not real school.LotanIt's more like babysitting.MichalThe challenge-- the big challenge is for the older children. They don't want to go.Ira GlassAfter just a few weeks of this, Lotan started to think, this is not good for our children. Maybe we need to get out of here, leave the hotel, leave our friends and family behind.LotanI realized that we're going to be stuck here in the Dead Sea for something like six, seven months. It's not a home. Let's do something else. Let's heal our family.MichalLotan was pushing to look for another place.Ira GlassMichal was not into this idea at all, of moving away from the hotel, from the other kibbutz members.MichalI understood why he wants to leave, but it was hard for me to leave the people I grew up with. These are the people I know all my life. So it was hard for me to understand that I'm leaving them. For me, I need to get used to the idea. I need time.LotanThat's the process with our relationship.MichalHe's fast-forward. [LAUGHS] He's-- he adjusts very quickly.LotanIf I'm deciding something, after I do my own thinking--MichalHe's very quick.Lotan--I move forward.MichalAnd I'm a slower person. [LAUGHS] I need time to do things, you know?Ira GlassYeah.So they had to decide if they would move out of the hotel. But there was a bigger question they were going to have to face someday. Should they move back to their kibbutz near the Gaza border? Like, ever?At this point, it's unclear how long the war will drag on. Over 1,600 Israelis have died, according to the Israeli military, and over 29,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health. Other kibbutzniks-- kibbutz members-- told me that they would only move back if somehow there were peace at the border.Or, you know, some conceivable path to some peace plan that would seem fair for the Palestinians so the kibbutzniks wouldn't have to worry about future attacks coming across the border, which, in a practical way, probably means they won't be moving back any time soon. Michal and Lotan try to imagine what it would take for them to return.MichalYou know, Lotan was asking me a few days ago, do you want to go to our home? Can you go back to this house?LotanDo you want to go back to a graveyard that 92 of your kibbutz members, including your father and mother, murdered there? Do you want to go back? You're going to cross the places that you know what happened there. The stories will come out in front of your eyes. It's a question.Ira GlassOK, so feel free to say as much or as little about this as you want. I'd like to ask you just a little bit about what happened with your family on October 7, just so people understand what it is you'd be going back to.LotanAt 6:30 AM, we had unnormal, unusual, massive missiles attack. And when I say unusual, it's not normal to have even one missile. But that was really a massive attack, so we ran to the safe room, closed the door. And the first thought I had is, OK, it's 6:30 AM. We probably will not go back to sleep. Let's turn on the coffee machine.Ira GlassFor decades, safe rooms have been required in all new Israeli homes, reinforced to withstand rocket attacks. Soon, Michal and Lotan see on the kibbutz WhatsApp group that attackers have made it inside the kibbutz. But they assume it's small, maybe 5 or 10 fighters, and they assume the army will be there soon.LotanBut minutes after that, when everyone was saying they are here, they are there, they are shooting at my house, they are throwing grenades, and you know everyone was leaving, you understand that they are spread all over the kibbutz. And then, just close the door and try to find ropes and things like that in order to tight the handle of the door because people were trying to-- were starting to write that they are seeking to open the safe room and taking people outside and shoot them.Ira GlassWe should explain that the safe rooms are designed for missiles coming in, not for people coming in trying to break into the safe room, so they don't lock from the inside.MichalExactly.LotanExactly because that's one huge part of our family story. Because something like 9:15, Michal's mother was writing us on the WhatsApp, there are terrorists near our house, and then there are terrorists inside the house. They are throwing grenades. They are shooting through the safe room door. And--MichalWe didn't understand that my dad was shot while sitting in the safe room. The bullets penetrate the door, and he was wounded while sitting in the safe room.Ira GlassMichal's brother Yuval talked to their mom then.LotanHe was telling her, Mom, be strong. Keep the door tight. The army is on its way. He was lying. There is no army at the kibbutz. But she-- that she was a really strong, realistic woman. She was saying to him, no, Yuval, I think this is the last time we're going to talk. Please tell everybody that we love them.Ira GlassThe last messages on WhatsApp have Michal and her brothers saying, "Mom, keep writing all the time. What's happening with you? Mom, answer." Their mom says, "Dad was shot, and they're throwing grenades. They blew up the safe room."LotanAnd at 10:04, she was writing on the WhatsApp, "help, help," twice, and that's the last word we have. And now, imagine that we are sitting in our safe room, one-minute walk in from them, can do nothing, and realize that we don't have any more mom or dad for Michal, grandfather and grandmother for our children.Ira GlassDo you tell the children?MichalYes, they heard. They knew. They kept asking, what about Grandpa and Grandma? And the only answer I had was, I don't know. I didn't want to say something that is not true. So I just told them that I don't know. It's hard to hear that-- I don't know.Ira GlassLotan says at this point they realized they needed to do anything they could think of to keep their kids alive.LotanBut what I had only is a baseball bat, a dog that probably would got killed the first time they're going to go, and they were hanging under our house.Ira GlassThey-- Hamas fighters-- seemed like they were using the storage space downstairs as a small base, keeping weapons there. The family heard explosions and gunfire. The youngest, the boy again, is nine years old.LotanAnd my son, in a terrified way, told us, Dad, Dad, I don't want to die here. And we look at him and told everyone, no, no one is going to die here. We have the dog, the baseball bat, and we are in the second floor. That's our fortress. And you, all of you, are now going to write what you're going to take when we're going to be outside, when they're going to rescue us. And they made a list.Ira GlassAnd they waited, from the morning all through the afternoon and into the night, trying not to make any noise at all. They had no food, no water. If someone had to pee, they did it in a wastebasket while everybody looked away. They were there for 19 hours with their kids.Ira GlassWhat did they do all that time?MichalNothing.LotanThey didn't do nothing.MichalWe did nothing.LotanThey watched me and woke me up if I was falling asleep because I was handling the handle of the door with a baseball bat and what I ever did to tight the door with ropes and things like that. They heard the shooting or the explosion or anything like that, they just were silenced. They were amazing. They understand the situation.Ira GlassFinally, the army came at midnight and rescued them. When they got to the hotel the next day, of course the kids couldn't just shake this off. Their son, the nine-year-old, had had a full day of whispering in the safe room.LotanHe's the most, I think, the fragile one. And he kept whispering three days after that in the hotel. And we just brought him his drums and his LEGO, and he started to live again, so it's OK.Ira GlassSo could they ever go back and live at Be'eri? Two or three weeks after the attack, Michal went home again, the first time, to the kibbutz to see what it was like.MichalGoing back was very hard for me. When I was there, I just shut myself. So I just saw everything, but I was very-- how do you say this word? I don't know. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]LotanVery cool.MichalI was very cool, yes.Ira GlassLike your feelings were shut down.MichalExactly.Ira GlassYeah.MichalI was there for, like, 10 minutes. I took some stuff that my daughter asked. And just, I couldn't stand-- it's not my home. It was so messy and dirty. And I couldn't stay there, so--Ira GlassThat's interesting. It didn't even seem like your home. It just seemed like some other place?MichalNo. No. It's not mine.Ira GlassOther people I talked to who returned to their kibbutzim told me that walking into their homes was like everything was frozen from when they ran out, like it was still October 7. One woman said she felt like she was watching herself in a movie. She felt so distanced from it. One man told me he tries to go back once a week to try to absorb what's happened.MichalI couldn't even sit on my sofa. I was there just for 10 minutes. I couldn't stay in the house.Ira GlassSo when you think about going back there, what do you think? Going back there to try to live there, how would that work?MichalI don't know. I don't know. That's the big question. Some days, I'm telling to myself, yes, I want to go back. And some days, I'm telling, what are you thinking about? This is not a place to live. It's a graveyard. No. No, no. It's still not-- it's not a decision I can make now. I need more time.Ira GlassSo she went back to the hotel. Where they still had to decide, where would they live right now? Should they leave the hotel and set out on their own in the short run?By early November, Lotan definitely wanted to leave. Michal did not. And then she saw how badly their oldest daughter, Aya, was doing. Again, Aya's 13. And in the weeks after October 7, she was the person in the family struggling the most.She was skipping school every day and tried to hide it from them. She just stayed in her room all day, doing nothing. This was completely unlike her, Michal says.Before October 7, she loved going to school, went happily, never missed a day. She was an athlete, came home from volleyball at 7:00 three nights a week. At night, she would hang with her friends. She was busy.MichalTo see her going to sleep very late at night and wanting to sleep late in the morning-- everything she had is not-- it's not happening. No school, no learning, no volleyball. The only thing that's left is her friends, which are confused as she is.So they're going around with no purpose. And this is what bothers us the most, that there is no purpose for them here. They need something to wake up for in the morning. And over here, it's too much pain and too much dark.Ira GlassSeeing Aya like this, that's what convinced Michal that Lotan was right. They needed to get away from the hotel. Their kids needed that. But where to go?Now, as they were talking about this as a couple, members of the kibbutz were in a much bigger conversation about leaving the hotel as a group. There was so much damage to their kibbutz, so many homes and buildings set on fire, burned to the ground, bombed, hit with grenades and bullets. It would take two or three years to rebuild before they could move back.So they were looking at temporary places that the whole group could relocate to while that happened. Lotan was one of the kibbutz leaders figuring out where they should go. The choice came down to two locations, and Lotan had decided that wanted to go to a peaceful village called Kedma.The idea is, everybody could move there and heal, figure out in a few years whether they will move back to Be'eri or not. The vote was November 22. Lotan's side lost by 40 votes. And the place the kibbutz chose-- in Hatzerim, near a big airbase-- that was a place that he and Michal did not want to live.LotanI knew already. I knew for sure that she's thinking the same.MichalYeah. I remember he told me, I'm not moving to Hatzerim. And I said, OK.Ira GlassAnd that decided it. They were not going to stay with the kibbutz. They'd strike out on their own. So they talked to their kids about this plan.Aya hated it. She didn't want to speak with me for this story, but her parents say she was angry. One thing she still had from her old life was her friends, who had just gone through this trauma together-- were still going through it, in a way.LotanYou know, she had two friends that were kidnapped, and they returned from Gaza Strip. And she has also one friend that was severely wounded and lost her mother and a brother. So--MichalOne is dead.LotanAnd one is dead.Ira GlassAnd what did she say to you when she was angry about it? What was she saying?MichalShe was shouting why we have to take her apart of her friends and that we're not thinking about her. It was hard to hear. You know, when you live in the kibbutz, the friends are the most important thing.I don't know how to express this in words. But we have this connection that you cannot find anywhere else because we grew up together. We did everything together. We hang out in the morning, in the afternoon. We slept together. We ate together. We studied together. We did everything together.And this is what she has right now, and she's going to lose it. I understand why she's angry. I understand. But I don't want that death will be so present in every way.Ira GlassYeah.MichalI don't want it.Ira GlassTheir two other kids were good with the idea of them leaving the hotel. The littlest told them, we can live in a car as long as we're together. It's fine. But with Aya, she came back to it over and over.LotanIt happens all the time.MichalIt's every day. Are you sure you want to go? Are you sure you're not going to stay?Ira GlassMichal explained to Aya that since they really might never move back to Be'eri, it didn't make sense to move to the temporary location with her friends right now and then split with them in three years and start over again. Easier to leave now, at an age when she can make new friends. She told Aya that she would drive her back to see her old friends any time she wants. But there are certain things she didn't say to Aya.MichalI didn't tell her that I don't want to live in a place that mourning is going to be a big part of everything.Ira GlassYeah.MichalI cannot tell her this.Ira GlassWhy not?MichalI don't know. I don't know.Ira GlassDo you not want to say that to her because you're scared it'll affect how she sees her friends and their life back in the kibbutz?MichalYes. You know, just yesterday they told us that Yossi, her best friend's father, were murdered in captivity. So it's going to happen all the time.Ira GlassThat conversation was in January. They were still in the hotel. The plan was to move February 1 to a house near a city called Kiryat Gat, maybe a half-hour drive from the border. And it's at this point the family got a lucky break-- something they didn't expect.MichalAnd the school she's going to go to, there is friends that she knows from our area that moved to the same place.Ira GlassOh, wow. That's really, really fortunate.MichalYes. So it makes her heart more calm. And these are kids that she knows and she's friends of, not from Be'eri exactly, but just from our area.So she's not opposite anymore, as she used to. Today was the first day she went to school and studied and opened her notebook. Just today, after three months.Ira GlassMaybe, Michal said, she finally understands that things are going back to normal and she's going to have to go to school like normal with other kids who are moving on.As move-in day approached, feelings in the family were all over the place. Aya was up and down-- a lot of down.MichalI think Abel and Dedar, the little kids, they are excited to see the new life. Lotan is very excited about this. I'm not excited. I feel sad leaving the kibbutz. And even though I decided to do that, it's still sad for me.This is our decision of moving, but I didn't choose it. This is what makes me so sad. They chose it. They decided it for me.Ira Glass"They." You mean Hamas.MichalYes.Ira GlassYeah.MichalAnd it's hard for me not to have my parents around and not to ask them what they think.Ira GlassYeah.MichalAnd you know, my mom, she was-- if I would move, she would come and help me clean and help me decide what to do. And now, she's not here to do that. So every decision is-- she's so present with her not-presence. (CHUCKLING) I don't know how to say it.Ira GlassYeah.They moved February 1, and I called one last time a few weeks after that. The kids are in their new schools. The family's renting a house. Lotan and Michal are bracing for what it's going to be like to have their paychecks paid to them directly and living the way you and I do, where we have to worry about money and paying bills.But one thing that was different in this last call was that they both seemed way more certain that they're never going to move back to Be'eri. There's a possibility, sure, but they both said it's likely they'll never return. Aya, meanwhile, is mad all the time. It's very severe, Michal told me, worse than before.She asks all the time to be driven back to the hotel to see her friends. She's gone back once a week. Michal feels like this is one of these parenting choices where she and Lotan made the right call to get the family away from the hotel and start a new life. But that doesn't make it feel any better. She told me she hopes that someday Aya will understand and even forgive them for it.Coming up, if you want to inspire your family at a family meeting once a week every single week, after a while, how do you come up with anything original to say? That's in a minute from Chicago Public Radio when our program continues.One More Week with Coach McGuireIra GlassIt'sThis American Life.I'm Ira Glass. Today's show, "Family Meeting," the stories of people who care about each other, or are supposed to care about each other, coming together to figure stuff out. And of course, these sort of meetings happen in non-family settings also.I personally find it revolting when any boss refers to his employees as family, but I acknowledge there is an entire workplace version of this. And of course, there's a whole tradition of this in sports-- high school sports teams, where the coach sits everybody down for the big "come to Jesus" talk about how things have been going and what needs to happen next.One of our producers, Chris Benderev, was looking around at the stuff that high school coaches say to teams before their big games. He found a lot of "let's get out there and crush them." Also a lot of the underdog version of that-- "nobody believes in us, but I believe in us." And then he ran across this one speech where the coach tried a different approach. Kind of striking.McGuireTalking to most of you seniors. You know, when you go back to--Ira GlassThis is in a locker room in Southlake, Texas. The team is the Cedar High School High Longhorns. Their coach, Joey McGuire. They're in the playoffs. If they lose this game, season's over. The team is ready to go out onto the field.McGuireYou know, this is a lot different. You go week five, week six, there's always another week seven. This is different. If we don't take care of business, that's it. Ain't coming back in the locker room next week.(SHOUTING) If you care about each other enough like we talk about, if you care about and love each other like we talk about, you have a sense of urgency to get one more week with your family, to get one more week with your family! Go find that--Ira GlassSmart, right? Win, and we get one more week together. Our producer, Chris, wondered if this was a move that the coach uses a lot, so he called up Coach McGuire, who said, yes, he has said this before in other playoffs. But he says it's also a thing he feels.McGuireI talk all the time about being a family and being more than just a team. And that was such a huge game. I mean, there's probably 15,000 people. It's two of the best teams in the nation.Ira GlassThese are Texas high school teams working their way up to a state championship. Longhorns were playing the Carroll High School Dragons. Coach McGuire says that he knew that if they lost that game they were about to play, it really does feel like something. When you lose at the end of the season, that group of people, you're never going to play together again.McGuireIt's almost like there's a death. Most people don't talk about that today could be the last game. And so that was my point.This ain't a bunch of guys that play football! We just get to play football together because this is a brotherhood! This is a family! And man, whenever you have that, it's tough to destroy because you fight every single moment to keep it.That's what we got to do tonight. Because you win, we get another week together. And that's all I want. That's all I want. Is everybody with me?PlayersYes, sir!Ira GlassSo the team went out there in front of all those people. And how'd it go?McGuireWe end up getting beat 37-35 right at the end of the game on an absolutely horrible call. But we ended up getting beat 37-35.Ira GlassActually, it was a little worse than that-- 37-33. He says in the locker room afterward, it was really hard. But even if you win the state championship, which he has, that's hard, too.Because that's the end. No more weeks together. Even if they win, there's that loss. He says he always makes it a point to thank the seniors, because it's often hardest for the seniors, you know, leaving the family.Act Two: Sealed With A DissIra GlassAct Two, Sealed With a Diss. So sometimes the reason for a family meeting is a conflict that a kid is having at school. And then the parent has to decide, did my kid do something wrong or is the problem the other kid?In this next story, the parents have definitely come down on one side of that one. The story unfolds in a series of letters between two moms. It's an excerpt of a short story by Nafissa Thompson-Spires, read first by actors Eisa Davis and Erika Alexander.(SUBJECT) EISA DAVIS AS LUCINDA: Tuesday, October 1, 1991. Hello, Monica. I'm sure you remember me from the class field trip to the Getty in September. It has been brought to my attention that your daughter Fatima may have started a nasty rumor about my Christinia. I hope to clear this up, as we both know how ugly these things can get.It is true that Christinia's hamster died recently, but it is absolutely not true that it died at Chrissy's hand. At no time has Chrissy ever put Hambone or any of her previous hamsters in the microwave, dryer, or dishwasher. What kind of child would make up something like that?It sounds-- and I say this respectfully, so I hope you won't be offended-- like Fatima has had a very hard time getting acclimated here, and that's understandable. But I do hope you will deal with her before any such incidents become frequent. Children who start lying young often end up with long-time patterns of dishonesty.All best, Dr. Lucinda Johnston, PsyD Licensed Therapist. Welcome Wagon, Westwood Primary School, Events Coordinator, Jack and Jill, Claremont Branch.(SUBJECT) ERIKA ALEXANDER AS MONICA: Monday, October 7, 1991. Dear Lucinda, I apologize for my late reply, but I only found your letter at the bottom of Fatima's backpack when I did my weekly cleaning. Thank you for writing to me.Fatima says she only repeated what Christinia herself told her. Many of Fatima's stories about Christinia this year and last, which I won't recount here, have been disturbing, to say the least. But none as disturbing as Christinia's enjoyment of torturing rodents.Fatima has a strong imagination and writes beautiful lyric poetry, which she started reading at age four. But she does not have a history of lying or telling gruesome stories. And unlike Christinia, she has no history of running off with other girls' shoes while their feet dangle from the monkey bars.I appreciate your concerns about Fatima. And even though Christinia has made it much more difficult for her to find friends at Westwood, Fatima will acclimate soon. She's going to a sleepover at Emily's this weekend. Is Christinia going? If so, I hope you will encourage her to play nice.Best, Monica Willis, PhD. PS-- it is true that liars who start young often end up with psychological and social problems of the sort that Christinia has demonstrated over the past year. How lucky for you and Christinia that she has access to psychotherapy through your practice.(SUBJECT) EISA DAVIS AS LUCINDA: Dear Monica, I never expected so much defensiveness when I wrote my original letter. Perhaps you misread it. All I wanted to emphasize is that I understand why a girl in Fatima's position and one with her background would make up such stories.It's hard to get attention in a new place. There is probably some petty jealousy going on. But I think we can resolve this. I don't know how you did things at Fatima's old school-- in Fresno, was it? But here, we try to help the children work through their problems without getting too involved.I suppose you already know, and have known all along, that Christinia will not attend Emily's party, so there's no need for me to encourage her to "play nice." You've probably heard that history already, so I won't rehash it. But I will say that it wasn't Chrissy's fault that Emily broke her nose when she fell.Finally, and I say this respectfully, but maybe it would be wise to go through Fatima's backpack every night instead of once in a blue moon. I have heard from more than one parent that it smells like eggs. My best, Dr. Lucinda Johnston, Licensed Therapist, author ofTrainUpaChild.(SUBJECT) ERIKA ALEXANDER AS MONICA: Dear Lucinda-- or should I say Dr. Johnston-- I'd like to resolve this as much as you would, but that won't happen if all your letters begin and end with backbiting. I'm not of the mind that the only two Black children in the class should be enemies, nor do I like the attention it draws to them or their parents when they're already in a difficult position.I would think that a Black woman of your stature and success would understand how isolating work and school environments like Westwood can be for people like us. I hoped Christinia and Fatima could be friends and could support each other in this space. But it's been clear since second grade that you and Christinia are not willing to make that work.I'm sure Fatima would let Christinia into her growing inner circle, even her after-school reading club, if Christinia would only apologize and behave. Jealousy can become a lifelong problem. On that note, I hate to bring this up now, but we were surprised by how poorly Christinia behaved when Fatima's poem won over hers last year.I'd like to make sure that we don't end up with a repeat performance of that tantrum when the poetry competition rolls around this year. As for the hard-boiled egg, we resolved that last spring and bought Fatima a new backpack. And I believe you knew that already.Cheers. Dr. Monica Willis, PhD, author ofEveryVoiceCounts--HelpingChildrenofColorSucceedatPredominantlyWhiteSchools.(SUBJECT) EISA DAVIS AS LUCINDA: Monica, excuse the informal note. I think you're doing both yourself and Fatima a great injustice by continually emphasizing her brilliance over other children. Lots of people skip grades, and skipping kindergarten isn't something to brag about.I doubt that the standards at her old school were as rigorous as those at Westwood. What exactly was she advanced at? Nap time? If you'll recall, moreover, I was there at the recital where Fatima read her award-winning poem. And while my doctorates-- yes, plural-- may not be in literature, I'm pretty sure hardly anyone would call "Butterfly Pie" a work of poetic genius.You can't rhyme "pie" with "pie" multiple times and call that poetry. You just can't, even if you have the excuse of only being in fourth grade. Isn't your degree, by the way, an EdD? Lucinda.(SUBJECT) ERIKA ALEXANDER AS MONICA: Lucinda, I'm not surprised that Fatima's subtle wordplay was lost on you, since it's clear reading problems run in the family. Not everyone is suited for literary work. I'm sure you know that from your own writing struggles and the extra effort you had to put behind your research in order for anyone to take it seriously.Isn't there still some kind of issue with your last project and the IRB? Or is the issue with Dr. Patel's ex-wife? My very best, Monica.(SUBJECT) EISA DAVIS AS LUCINDA: Monica, I'm not going to dignify most of your comments with a response. This will be my last letter because I can see I'm not going to get anywhere with you. There's some kind of blockage there that I really think you should explore with a licensed professional, especially if you call yourself a professor.At one time, I wondered if we were too harsh in recommending that you and your family wait another year before joining our Jack and Jill chapter. But I can see now that we were right. I'm afraid I can never recommend you for our club. You display a volatile combination of residual ghetto and uppity negress. And that will be your undoing, if Fatima isn't.Sincerely, Dr. Lucinda M Johnston, Licensed Therapist, author ofTrainUpaChild,Welcome Wagon Westwood Primary School, Events Coordinator, Jack and Jill, Claremont Chapter.(SUBJECT) ERIKA ALEXANDER AS MONICA: Lucinda, I'm not even going to respond to that. But I will say that if someone here is uppity, it's the one of us with two little brats who have run off three au pairs. Who even uses that term if they're not French, and I'm pretty sure your cousin Shaquana isn't? They're nannies. Nannies!And if they're your own relative, then they're just babysitters, or bums who need a hookup. This bourginess and the way it keeps you from connecting with your kids is half of your problem. The other half you probably can't fix without medication. Good thing you can write prescriptions. Oh wait, you're not that kind of doctor.How can I be uppity when I've never had any help and started out as a single parent before marrying Jordan? If putting myself through school and becoming the highest-educated person in my family with no help but God's makes me uppity, then so be it. We are humble people, in spite of our education and finances, and we have more class in our excrement than you have in your whole hamster-murdering family.And yes, there is a bit of ghetto still left in me, enough to tell you who can finish the fight if it gets to that point. We're never too far from Oakland or the South Side. Let's keep it real. Monica.(SUBJECT) EISA DAVIS AS LUCINDA: Monica, I do believe that was a threat. The Claremont Police Department will not take this lightly. And tell Fatima to stop pinning notes to the inside of Chrissy's bookbag when she's not looking. Chrissy could injure herself on a dirty safety pin, knowing you people, and end up with Hepatitis A, B, or C, or worse.I've tried to resolve our differences by working directly and exclusively with you and their teacher, Mrs. Watson. But I will have no choice but to contact Principal Lee, in addition to the police, if this persists. Lucinda.(SUBJECT) ERIKA ALEXANDER AS MONICA: Lucinda, only you would suggest something so disgusting as intentionally injuring a child with a dirty safety pin. But then again, it was Christinia who put that tack on Renee Potts's chair last year and caused her to need a tetanus shot. Perverse minds think alike, apparently. Lose my number and address, and stop making your kid do your dirty work. M.(SUBJECT) EISA DAVIS AS LUCINDA: Monica, turn blue, turn blue, turn blue, blue, blue. Look, I've written a poem. Perhaps I should send it toLadybugmagazine. Love, Lucinda.(SUBJECT) ERIKA ALEXANDER AS MONICA: Lucinda, you need Jesus. Do not write me again or I will contact my lawyer. I've asked Mrs. Watson to check Fatima's backpack for correspondence from you, and I have made it clear that I do not want further contact from you or Christinia.You are not to speak to Fatima either. I'm requesting a meeting with the school and you and your husband so that we can nip this crazy mess in the bud once and for all. Monica. Jack and Jill, Claremont Chapter.(SUBJECT) ALVIN MELATHE AS PRINCIPAL LEE: October 21, 1991. Dear Mrs. Johnston and Mrs. Willis, it has come to my attention that your respective daughters, Christinia and Fatima, engaged in a brutal fistfight at school. As you know, this behavior violates not only the Westwood code of conduct, but also our core values as a school, and is punishable by expulsion. I am sending this letter as a followup to the discussion I had with each of you over the phone.I would like to meet with the two of you and Mrs. Watson, ASAP. My secretary will schedule. Sincerely, Principal Lee, Westwood Primary and Secondary School.October 25, 1991. Dear Drs. Willis, the school's board and I thank you for your generous donation and for agreeing to serve on the Westwood Welcome Wagon. Given the sharp improvement of your child's behavior, we can agree to rescind our threat of Fatima's expulsion from school. The reputation of our school depends on the efforts of involved parents like yourselves. Sincerely, Principal Lee.(SUBJECT) ERIKA ALEXANDER AS MONICA: November 3, 1991. Lucinda, thank you for inviting Fatima to Chrissy's party. She will be happy to attend. And thank you for the lovely fruit basket.(CHUCKLING) You're so bad. It's true, Mrs. Watson looks terrible in that color, and yet Principal Lee finds reasons to look. But I won't say anything more in writing. Jordan and I will discuss the Jack and Jill potluck with you when we see you.

So he actually adlibbed his way through a lot of the show, including Annie's biggest and most famous song, which he delivered as--BryanThat's cool. What are we going to do tomorrow?Ira GlassI'm Ira Glass. Back next week with more stories ofThisAmerican Life.,Prologue: PrologueIra GlassFrom WBEZ Chicago, it'sThisAmericanLife.I'm Ira Glass.BryanOK, so listen. Right now, we're going to be a little bit quiet, because--[CHILD WHINING]--we're going to have a family talk. Are you ready for a family talk?ChildWait, wait, wait, wait, Dad.BryanWhat?Ira GlassBryan LeBaron is dad of a big family, seven kids in all. He mostly grew up in the United States, but his father and most of his family is Mexican. And he moved back there a few years ago.Back in November, he gathered everybody together for a family meeting outside on a patio. Most of the kids were in a long bench, holding pillows.BryanLexie thinks that this is an important moment in our family, and I agree with her.Ira GlassLexie is Lexie Harrison-Cripps, the journalist that recorded this meeting. Because she knew what some of the kids did not know-- that Bryan was planning to run for a seat in Mexico's House of Representatives.ChildWhat does that mean?BryanI want to work for the government. That's what that means. And since I'm going to be running, it's going to be a lot of work for me, and I'm going to be traveling a lot. I'm going to be away from home a lot.And when we go places, people are going to want pictures. So maybe you're walking with me, and somebody will take a picture of us. We don't know how--FernandoI'm gonna be famous![LAUGHTER]BryanWe don't know exactly what that's going to be like, right? But one of the things also is that because of certain things that happened in our family, now there's people in our town that may not want to vote for me. And it might even cause people to want to be mean to our family. OK? And so I wanted to have a talk-- Mom and I wanted to have a talk with you so that you can be ready.Ira GlassNot just ready for the campaign, which is months away, but he's called his family meeting right now, in November, because something's come up that's not only going to affect his candidacy but everyone in the family in the next few days. What's happened is that Macario, their 17-year-old, has just made a big, public declaration on Instagram, telling the world that he's gay, which in some places would be, like, whatever.But this family is Mormon, living in a tight-knit fundamentalist community in Mexico. Macario and the other kids go to a fundamentalist Mormon school that very much disapproves of homosexuality. Bryan figured kids at school might start saying cruel and hateful stuff to Macario and his brothers and sisters. Already, some classmates were posting pretty awful comments on Instagram. Bryan wanted all of his children to be prepared.BryanOK, guys, so guess what? You know how a lot of times we always went to church and we always hear about people that are going to date and get married?Ira GlassThree of the kids listening to this are young. There's nine-year-old Ahriella, seven-year-old Chanel, and four-year-old Franco. And what that means is that before Bryan can tell them "your brother is gay," he first has to explain "gay," the whole idea of gayness, to these little kids.BryanChanel, this is more for you and Ahriella, OK? Have you guys ever heard of the term "gay"?Child 1A what?BryanGay.Child 1Oh, yeah.BryanWhat does it mean?Child 2Gay means--BryanYeah.Child 2--like, people that, like, wear necklaces that are meant for girls.BryanSo boys that wear necklaces that are for girls?Ira GlassGood guess, he tells them--BryanThat's OK.Ira Glass--and then launches into his explanation. He keeps it simple.BryanBut when people say the word "gay," usually it means either two boys that like each other--Child 2I knew it.Bryan--and maybe even one day want to get married, or two girls that like each other and that maybe even want to get married. And somebody who feels that way, just like I look at Mom and I think she's beautiful, there can be boys that look at other boys and think they're beautiful. OK? Does that make sense?Ira GlassIt's yes all around.BryanOK.Ira GlassOn to the big reveal.BryanWell, guess what? Macario-- he thinks that boys are beautiful, and he thinks that he wants to fall in love with a boy. OK? And that's what people call "gay."Child 1Mm-hmm.BryanOK? Now, that doesn't mean that something's wrong with Macario. Macario is perfect just the way that he is, and we love him and we're always going to love him.Child 2But why do they call it "gay"?BryanThat's just the name they gave it. Why do they call boys "boys" and girls "girls"? There's just a name for everything.Ira GlassI should say that two years ago, this is not how Bryan would have talked about being gay. He was raised to believe that it was a choice and sinful. When Macario came out to him, Macario explained that he had already tried to pray and fast his way out of being gay, and it was impossible.And Bryan believed him. He changed how he saw all of it. And as he talks about Macario with the family, Macario is sitting exactly in between his two little sisters as they learn what "gay" means. He smiles, like a mystery contestant on an old-timey game show whose secret identity was just revealed.MacarioI didn't really know what was going on.Ira GlassAnd did your dad tell you, OK, here's what we're going to explain to the kids in this meeting?MacarioNope. It was just, I was going to say I was gay, and it literally-- it was not very planned out.Ira GlassThis, of course, is Macario. He says it felt good to hear his dad say all these things in front of everybody. Next, Bryan explained to the little ones in the family the kids in school might be pretty mean about Macario, and we'll need to be ready.BryanWhen people say, oh, your brother is gay, he's going to go to the devil, oh, ha, ha--Child 1I will say--BryanHa, ha, ha--Child 1I will say--BryanThat's what people will say--Child 1--that's not true.LindiHey, listen.BryanWell, that what's not true? That Macario is gay?Child 1No, that he's going to go to the devil.BryanSo I want you to be ready because little kids can be mean sometimes.Child 1Yeah, I know.Child 2No!Ira GlassMacario tells them about some of the mean things that kids have said at school. There was this one kid.MacarioTheir dad said they can't do anything to legally kick me out of the town, but they can do everything in their power to make it so that I want to leave on my own. And they just only did that and are doing that because I'm gay. That's the only reason. And I know that they're just doing that because they've been told their whole life that I'm a terrible-- that anyone is a terrible person if they're gay.So I mean, I get where they're coming from. But like, when they started just saying shit-- I mean, started saying stuff about our friends-- my friends and the people supporting me and then you guys-- like how that guy said that. He was like, no, we can't blame the devil for this. It's their parents' fault. They raised him wrong. They lived in California, Western culture or whatever.When they said that, it just made me so bothered because I'm like, I don't know. You can get mad at me and you can think that I'm this or that, but all these people who are supporting me--Ira GlassSo everybody's on the same page, all prepared. Macario is feeling great about it.Child 1I think it's time for bed.BryanYou got that right. OK. I want a hug.Ira GlassAnd when they go to school after this prep, none of the things that Bryan prepared them for happened. The school made a rule that nobody could talk about Macario. Overall, most of the Mormon community continued to treat Macario like they always had.All this was a little sad for nine-year-old Ahriella, who marched into school ready to tussle, to defend her beloved brother after the family meeting.BryanShe said, well, I walked into class and I just said, hi, everybody, how's it going? Anything new happen yesterday? And they're like, no. And so she said, well, how about the day before? No, nothing new. And she said, hmm, OK.(LAUGHING) So she just went about her day. So I don't know. It didn't seem to phase the younger kids at school. It was more Macario's classmates. I think the teenagers just maybe shocked by it and not understanding exactly what to think.Ira GlassIn fact, some teenagers set off a pretty frightening array of firecrackers at their house and threw rocks wrapped in pieces of paper with Macario's name written on them, which was scary. Kids and adults posted comments online, like "Macario should find a tall tree and a rope, should die." Bryan and his wife Lindi took all the kids out of the Mormon school.But the family had been prepped. They understood that people might get mad about Macario. And inside the family, the family meeting set the tone. It was a preemptive strike that made Macario's gayness a non-issue, a non-negotiable fact.BryanThey really have had little-- not many questions since then. It seemed to really not phase them at all. It was just, OK, you know, that's cool. What are we going to do tomorrow? [LAUGHS]Ira GlassCan we have a snack? Is there ice cream?BryanThat's it, exactly.Ira GlassWell, today on our program, the power of a family meeting to drop some news-- like your brother's gay-- or the classic one people remember, I guess-- we're getting a divorce. And then there are the administrative family meetings where parents announce some changes in how we do the dishes around here or take out the garbage or whatever, and everybody's going to be doing their fair share.What a family meeting can and cannot accomplish, especially in families where the kids do not want to go with the parents' plan, that's our show today. Stay with us.Act One: A Slow Decision Process That’s Mostly But Maybe Not Completely OverIra GlassAct 1-- A Slow Decision Process That's Mostly But Maybe Not Completely Over. Sometimes when there's a family decision, the family can keep talking about it for months, on and off-- in the car, at meals, whenever-- with everybody weighing in with different points of view. Over the last few months, I've been talking to the parents in one family like that. Back when I first chatted with them in December, I asked the dad in the family how often the topic comes up.LotanWe are talking about that almost in each minute of the day. Even right now, before you called, we were talking about what we're going to do.Ira GlassThis is Lotan Pinyan. What he's talking about with his wife Michal is, where are they going to live next? They're a youngish couple in Israel with three kids-- 9, 11, and 13 at the time of this conversation. Both educators, he's head of development, building a school and a campus for Bedouins, nomadic Arab tribes. And Michal--MichalI'm an educational counselor.LotanNo, she's a doctor of education. OK? She's a doctor of education.Ira GlassLotan, why do you feel like you have to jump in and say that?LotanBecause we can end the conversation without you to know that she's really a doctor.Ira GlassLotan is, perhaps you can tell, somebody who's always quick to speak his mind, sure of what he thinks. Michal's more deliberative. They used to live in a kibbutz in Israel, Kibbutz Be'eri on the border with Gaza. When Hamas crossed that border on October 7, like so many families, they hid in the safe room in their house.Dozens of their neighbors were killed, more at Be'eri than at any kibbutz that day-- 1 in 10 people, including Michal's parents. And when it was over, they and most everyone else from the kibbutz were relocated to a tourist hotel by the Dead Sea, an hour-and-a-half drive from their old home in the Gaza border.MichalThe whole kibbutz is here. The hotel is closed just for our kibbutz. There's no guests from outside.LotanWe are talking about something like 1,000 people inside this hotel. You have a lot of discussions just in the lobby.Ira GlassDiscussions about where they're all going to live next. In December when we first talked, it was just two months after the attack. And each family had to decide, would they stay with the community? Would they ever want to return to the kibbutz where they'd just gone through this traumatic assault?LotanIt's 1,000 people. You have a lot of ideas. You have those people who want to stay together wherever the kibbutz will go, and those who say no.Ira GlassLots of people, especially the older people, were sure they wanted to go back and rebuild. People with kids were all over the place. And leaving a kibbutz, quitting kibbutz life, is a big deal. A kibbutz is a special kind of tight-knit community.Kibbutzim were originally set up as collective farms on socialist principles, and Be'eri is still run on the old-school socialist ideals most kibbutzim in Israel have abandoned. For example, as a member of the kibbutz, you turn over every cent that you earn at your job, your entire paycheck, to the collective.MichalBut the kibbutz gives us everything we need.Ira GlassAnd that means everything. They give you a house to live in, cars to drive, full health care, a gym and a swimming pool, and a dining hall, if you don't want to cook, and spending money for necessities but also for fun stuff like family vacations, to cover your kids' school and college. Children spend all day every day with other kids their age. It's a great way to raise kids. They can roam around. Michal describes what's so nice about kibbutz life this way.MichalYou don't have any worries-- you know, mortgage or payments. And you have a very strong community that makes you feel you belong to something big.Ira GlassMichal grew up this way on this kibbutz and loved it. Lotan moved to Be'eri with her when they first got together. He chafed at some of the rules at first, but got used to life in this big extended family. Now, after October 7, here he was with all of them at this hotel, figuring out what to do next.LotanAnd you know, it's a hotel. It's a nice place for three days of vacation, but it's not a way of living. You know, to see the smallest one go to sleep at something like midnight and--MichalYou don't have a family environment.Ira GlassMichal and Lotan were in one hotel room. The three kids were cooped up in another, getting on each other's nerves and into each other's hair. It's hard to be a family in that scattered situation.It was hard to supervise the kids. They were gone all day at work. Michal now had a 90-minute commute each way to and from her job. There was school for the kids, but it was a makeshift thing the kibbutz organized, not real school.LotanIt's more like babysitting.MichalThe challenge-- the big challenge is for the older children. They don't want to go.Ira GlassAfter just a few weeks of this, Lotan started to think, this is not good for our children. Maybe we need to get out of here, leave the hotel, leave our friends and family behind.LotanI realized that we're going to be stuck here in the Dead Sea for something like six, seven months. It's not a home. Let's do something else. Let's heal our family.MichalLotan was pushing to look for another place.Ira GlassMichal was not into this idea at all, of moving away from the hotel, from the other kibbutz members.MichalI understood why he wants to leave, but it was hard for me to leave the people I grew up with. These are the people I know all my life. So it was hard for me to understand that I'm leaving them. For me, I need to get used to the idea. I need time.LotanThat's the process with our relationship.MichalHe's fast-forward. [LAUGHS] He's-- he adjusts very quickly.LotanIf I'm deciding something, after I do my own thinking--MichalHe's very quick.Lotan--I move forward.MichalAnd I'm a slower person. [LAUGHS] I need time to do things, you know?Ira GlassYeah.So they had to decide if they would move out of the hotel. But there was a bigger question they were going to have to face someday. Should they move back to their kibbutz near the Gaza border? Like, ever?At this point, it's unclear how long the war will drag on. Over 1,600 Israelis have died, according to the Israeli military, and over 29,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health. Other kibbutzniks-- kibbutz members-- told me that they would only move back if somehow there were peace at the border.Or, you know, some conceivable path to some peace plan that would seem fair for the Palestinians so the kibbutzniks wouldn't have to worry about future attacks coming across the border, which, in a practical way, probably means they won't be moving back any time soon. Michal and Lotan try to imagine what it would take for them to return.MichalYou know, Lotan was asking me a few days ago, do you want to go to our home? Can you go back to this house?LotanDo you want to go back to a graveyard that 92 of your kibbutz members, including your father and mother, murdered there? Do you want to go back? You're going to cross the places that you know what happened there. The stories will come out in front of your eyes. It's a question.Ira GlassOK, so feel free to say as much or as little about this as you want. I'd like to ask you just a little bit about what happened with your family on October 7, just so people understand what it is you'd be going back to.LotanAt 6:30 AM, we had unnormal, unusual, massive missiles attack. And when I say unusual, it's not normal to have even one missile. But that was really a massive attack, so we ran to the safe room, closed the door. And the first thought I had is, OK, it's 6:30 AM. We probably will not go back to sleep. Let's turn on the coffee machine.Ira GlassFor decades, safe rooms have been required in all new Israeli homes, reinforced to withstand rocket attacks. Soon, Michal and Lotan see on the kibbutz WhatsApp group that attackers have made it inside the kibbutz. But they assume it's small, maybe 5 or 10 fighters, and they assume the army will be there soon.LotanBut minutes after that, when everyone was saying they are here, they are there, they are shooting at my house, they are throwing grenades, and you know everyone was leaving, you understand that they are spread all over the kibbutz. And then, just close the door and try to find ropes and things like that in order to tight the handle of the door because people were trying to-- were starting to write that they are seeking to open the safe room and taking people outside and shoot them.Ira GlassWe should explain that the safe rooms are designed for missiles coming in, not for people coming in trying to break into the safe room, so they don't lock from the inside.MichalExactly.LotanExactly because that's one huge part of our family story. Because something like 9:15, Michal's mother was writing us on the WhatsApp, there are terrorists near our house, and then there are terrorists inside the house. They are throwing grenades. They are shooting through the safe room door. And--MichalWe didn't understand that my dad was shot while sitting in the safe room. The bullets penetrate the door, and he was wounded while sitting in the safe room.Ira GlassMichal's brother Yuval talked to their mom then.LotanHe was telling her, Mom, be strong. Keep the door tight. The army is on its way. He was lying. There is no army at the kibbutz. But she-- that she was a really strong, realistic woman. She was saying to him, no, Yuval, I think this is the last time we're going to talk. Please tell everybody that we love them.Ira GlassThe last messages on WhatsApp have Michal and her brothers saying, "Mom, keep writing all the time. What's happening with you? Mom, answer." Their mom says, "Dad was shot, and they're throwing grenades. They blew up the safe room."LotanAnd at 10:04, she was writing on the WhatsApp, "help, help," twice, and that's the last word we have. And now, imagine that we are sitting in our safe room, one-minute walk in from them, can do nothing, and realize that we don't have any more mom or dad for Michal, grandfather and grandmother for our children.Ira GlassDo you tell the children?MichalYes, they heard. They knew. They kept asking, what about Grandpa and Grandma? And the only answer I had was, I don't know. I didn't want to say something that is not true. So I just told them that I don't know. It's hard to hear that-- I don't know.Ira GlassLotan says at this point they realized they needed to do anything they could think of to keep their kids alive.LotanBut what I had only is a baseball bat, a dog that probably would got killed the first time they're going to go, and they were hanging under our house.Ira GlassThey-- Hamas fighters-- seemed like they were using the storage space downstairs as a small base, keeping weapons there. The family heard explosions and gunfire. The youngest, the boy again, is nine years old.LotanAnd my son, in a terrified way, told us, Dad, Dad, I don't want to die here. And we look at him and told everyone, no, no one is going to die here. We have the dog, the baseball bat, and we are in the second floor. That's our fortress. And you, all of you, are now going to write what you're going to take when we're going to be outside, when they're going to rescue us. And they made a list.Ira GlassAnd they waited, from the morning all through the afternoon and into the night, trying not to make any noise at all. They had no food, no water. If someone had to pee, they did it in a wastebasket while everybody looked away. They were there for 19 hours with their kids.Ira GlassWhat did they do all that time?MichalNothing.LotanThey didn't do nothing.MichalWe did nothing.LotanThey watched me and woke me up if I was falling asleep because I was handling the handle of the door with a baseball bat and what I ever did to tight the door with ropes and things like that. They heard the shooting or the explosion or anything like that, they just were silenced. They were amazing. They understand the situation.Ira GlassFinally, the army came at midnight and rescued them. When they got to the hotel the next day, of course the kids couldn't just shake this off. Their son, the nine-year-old, had had a full day of whispering in the safe room.LotanHe's the most, I think, the fragile one. And he kept whispering three days after that in the hotel. And we just brought him his drums and his LEGO, and he started to live again, so it's OK.Ira GlassSo could they ever go back and live at Be'eri? Two or three weeks after the attack, Michal went home again, the first time, to the kibbutz to see what it was like.MichalGoing back was very hard for me. When I was there, I just shut myself. So I just saw everything, but I was very-- how do you say this word? I don't know. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]LotanVery cool.MichalI was very cool, yes.Ira GlassLike your feelings were shut down.MichalExactly.Ira GlassYeah.MichalI was there for, like, 10 minutes. I took some stuff that my daughter asked. And just, I couldn't stand-- it's not my home. It was so messy and dirty. And I couldn't stay there, so--Ira GlassThat's interesting. It didn't even seem like your home. It just seemed like some other place?MichalNo. No. It's not mine.Ira GlassOther people I talked to who returned to their kibbutzim told me that walking into their homes was like everything was frozen from when they ran out, like it was still October 7. One woman said she felt like she was watching herself in a movie. She felt so distanced from it. One man told me he tries to go back once a week to try to absorb what's happened.MichalI couldn't even sit on my sofa. I was there just for 10 minutes. I couldn't stay in the house.Ira GlassSo when you think about going back there, what do you think? Going back there to try to live there, how would that work?MichalI don't know. I don't know. That's the big question. Some days, I'm telling to myself, yes, I want to go back. And some days, I'm telling, what are you thinking about? This is not a place to live. It's a graveyard. No. No, no. It's still not-- it's not a decision I can make now. I need more time.Ira GlassSo she went back to the hotel. Where they still had to decide, where would they live right now? Should they leave the hotel and set out on their own in the short run?By early November, Lotan definitely wanted to leave. Michal did not. And then she saw how badly their oldest daughter, Aya, was doing. Again, Aya's 13. And in the weeks after October 7, she was the person in the family struggling the most.She was skipping school every day and tried to hide it from them. She just stayed in her room all day, doing nothing. This was completely unlike her, Michal says.Before October 7, she loved going to school, went happily, never missed a day. She was an athlete, came home from volleyball at 7:00 three nights a week. At night, she would hang with her friends. She was busy.MichalTo see her going to sleep very late at night and wanting to sleep late in the morning-- everything she had is not-- it's not happening. No school, no learning, no volleyball. The only thing that's left is her friends, which are confused as she is.So they're going around with no purpose. And this is what bothers us the most, that there is no purpose for them here. They need something to wake up for in the morning. And over here, it's too much pain and too much dark.Ira GlassSeeing Aya like this, that's what convinced Michal that Lotan was right. They needed to get away from the hotel. Their kids needed that. But where to go?Now, as they were talking about this as a couple, members of the kibbutz were in a much bigger conversation about leaving the hotel as a group. There was so much damage to their kibbutz, so many homes and buildings set on fire, burned to the ground, bombed, hit with grenades and bullets. It would take two or three years to rebuild before they could move back.So they were looking at temporary places that the whole group could relocate to while that happened. Lotan was one of the kibbutz leaders figuring out where they should go. The choice came down to two locations, and Lotan had decided that wanted to go to a peaceful village called Kedma.The idea is, everybody could move there and heal, figure out in a few years whether they will move back to Be'eri or not. The vote was November 22. Lotan's side lost by 40 votes. And the place the kibbutz chose-- in Hatzerim, near a big airbase-- that was a place that he and Michal did not want to live.LotanI knew already. I knew for sure that she's thinking the same.MichalYeah. I remember he told me, I'm not moving to Hatzerim. And I said, OK.Ira GlassAnd that decided it. They were not going to stay with the kibbutz. They'd strike out on their own. So they talked to their kids about this plan.Aya hated it. She didn't want to speak with me for this story, but her parents say she was angry. One thing she still had from her old life was her friends, who had just gone through this trauma together-- were still going through it, in a way.LotanYou know, she had two friends that were kidnapped, and they returned from Gaza Strip. And she has also one friend that was severely wounded and lost her mother and a brother. So--MichalOne is dead.LotanAnd one is dead.Ira GlassAnd what did she say to you when she was angry about it? What was she saying?MichalShe was shouting why we have to take her apart of her friends and that we're not thinking about her. It was hard to hear. You know, when you live in the kibbutz, the friends are the most important thing.I don't know how to express this in words. But we have this connection that you cannot find anywhere else because we grew up together. We did everything together. We hang out in the morning, in the afternoon. We slept together. We ate together. We studied together. We did everything together.And this is what she has right now, and she's going to lose it. I understand why she's angry. I understand. But I don't want that death will be so present in every way.Ira GlassYeah.MichalI don't want it.Ira GlassTheir two other kids were good with the idea of them leaving the hotel. The littlest told them, we can live in a car as long as we're together. It's fine. But with Aya, she came back to it over and over.LotanIt happens all the time.MichalIt's every day. Are you sure you want to go? Are you sure you're not going to stay?Ira GlassMichal explained to Aya that since they really might never move back to Be'eri, it didn't make sense to move to the temporary location with her friends right now and then split with them in three years and start over again. Easier to leave now, at an age when she can make new friends. She told Aya that she would drive her back to see her old friends any time she wants. But there are certain things she didn't say to Aya.MichalI didn't tell her that I don't want to live in a place that mourning is going to be a big part of everything.Ira GlassYeah.MichalI cannot tell her this.Ira GlassWhy not?MichalI don't know. I don't know.Ira GlassDo you not want to say that to her because you're scared it'll affect how she sees her friends and their life back in the kibbutz?MichalYes. You know, just yesterday they told us that Yossi, her best friend's father, were murdered in captivity. So it's going to happen all the time.Ira GlassThat conversation was in January. They were still in the hotel. The plan was to move February 1 to a house near a city called Kiryat Gat, maybe a half-hour drive from the border. And it's at this point the family got a lucky break-- something they didn't expect.MichalAnd the school she's going to go to, there is friends that she knows from our area that moved to the same place.Ira GlassOh, wow. That's really, really fortunate.MichalYes. So it makes her heart more calm. And these are kids that she knows and she's friends of, not from Be'eri exactly, but just from our area.So she's not opposite anymore, as she used to. Today was the first day she went to school and studied and opened her notebook. Just today, after three months.Ira GlassMaybe, Michal said, she finally understands that things are going back to normal and she's going to have to go to school like normal with other kids who are moving on.As move-in day approached, feelings in the family were all over the place. Aya was up and down-- a lot of down.MichalI think Abel and Dedar, the little kids, they are excited to see the new life. Lotan is very excited about this. I'm not excited. I feel sad leaving the kibbutz. And even though I decided to do that, it's still sad for me.This is our decision of moving, but I didn't choose it. This is what makes me so sad. They chose it. They decided it for me.Ira Glass"They." You mean Hamas.MichalYes.Ira GlassYeah.MichalAnd it's hard for me not to have my parents around and not to ask them what they think.Ira GlassYeah.MichalAnd you know, my mom, she was-- if I would move, she would come and help me clean and help me decide what to do. And now, she's not here to do that. So every decision is-- she's so present with her not-presence. (CHUCKLING) I don't know how to say it.Ira GlassYeah.They moved February 1, and I called one last time a few weeks after that. The kids are in their new schools. The family's renting a house. Lotan and Michal are bracing for what it's going to be like to have their paychecks paid to them directly and living the way you and I do, where we have to worry about money and paying bills.But one thing that was different in this last call was that they both seemed way more certain that they're never going to move back to Be'eri. There's a possibility, sure, but they both said it's likely they'll never return. Aya, meanwhile, is mad all the time. It's very severe, Michal told me, worse than before.She asks all the time to be driven back to the hotel to see her friends. She's gone back once a week. Michal feels like this is one of these parenting choices where she and Lotan made the right call to get the family away from the hotel and start a new life. But that doesn't make it feel any better. She told me she hopes that someday Aya will understand and even forgive them for it.Coming up, if you want to inspire your family at a family meeting once a week every single week, after a while, how do you come up with anything original to say? That's in a minute from Chicago Public Radio when our program continues.One More Week with Coach McGuireIra GlassIt'sThis American Life.I'm Ira Glass. Today's show, "Family Meeting," the stories of people who care about each other, or are supposed to care about each other, coming together to figure stuff out. And of course, these sort of meetings happen in non-family settings also.I personally find it revolting when any boss refers to his employees as family, but I acknowledge there is an entire workplace version of this. And of course, there's a whole tradition of this in sports-- high school sports teams, where the coach sits everybody down for the big "come to Jesus" talk about how things have been going and what needs to happen next.One of our producers, Chris Benderev, was looking around at the stuff that high school coaches say to teams before their big games. He found a lot of "let's get out there and crush them." Also a lot of the underdog version of that-- "nobody believes in us, but I believe in us." And then he ran across this one speech where the coach tried a different approach. Kind of striking.McGuireTalking to most of you seniors. You know, when you go back to--Ira GlassThis is in a locker room in Southlake, Texas. The team is the Cedar High School High Longhorns. Their coach, Joey McGuire. They're in the playoffs. If they lose this game, season's over. The team is ready to go out onto the field.McGuireYou know, this is a lot different. You go week five, week six, there's always another week seven. This is different. If we don't take care of business, that's it. Ain't coming back in the locker room next week.(SHOUTING) If you care about each other enough like we talk about, if you care about and love each other like we talk about, you have a sense of urgency to get one more week with your family, to get one more week with your family! Go find that--Ira GlassSmart, right? Win, and we get one more week together. Our producer, Chris, wondered if this was a move that the coach uses a lot, so he called up Coach McGuire, who said, yes, he has said this before in other playoffs. But he says it's also a thing he feels.McGuireI talk all the time about being a family and being more than just a team. And that was such a huge game. I mean, there's probably 15,000 people. It's two of the best teams in the nation.Ira GlassThese are Texas high school teams working their way up to a state championship. Longhorns were playing the Carroll High School Dragons. Coach McGuire says that he knew that if they lost that game they were about to play, it really does feel like something. When you lose at the end of the season, that group of people, you're never going to play together again.McGuireIt's almost like there's a death. Most people don't talk about that today could be the last game. And so that was my point.This ain't a bunch of guys that play football! We just get to play football together because this is a brotherhood! This is a family! And man, whenever you have that, it's tough to destroy because you fight every single moment to keep it.That's what we got to do tonight. Because you win, we get another week together. And that's all I want. That's all I want. Is everybody with me?PlayersYes, sir!Ira GlassSo the team went out there in front of all those people. And how'd it go?McGuireWe end up getting beat 37-35 right at the end of the game on an absolutely horrible call. But we ended up getting beat 37-35.Ira GlassActually, it was a little worse than that-- 37-33. He says in the locker room afterward, it was really hard. But even if you win the state championship, which he has, that's hard, too.Because that's the end. No more weeks together. Even if they win, there's that loss. He says he always makes it a point to thank the seniors, because it's often hardest for the seniors, you know, leaving the family.Act Two: Sealed With A DissIra GlassAct Two, Sealed With a Diss. So sometimes the reason for a family meeting is a conflict that a kid is having at school. And then the parent has to decide, did my kid do something wrong or is the problem the other kid?In this next story, the parents have definitely come down on one side of that one. The story unfolds in a series of letters between two moms. It's an excerpt of a short story by Nafissa Thompson-Spires, read first by actors Eisa Davis and Erika Alexander.(SUBJECT) EISA DAVIS AS LUCINDA: Tuesday, October 1, 1991. Hello, Monica. I'm sure you remember me from the class field trip to the Getty in September. It has been brought to my attention that your daughter Fatima may have started a nasty rumor about my Christinia. I hope to clear this up, as we both know how ugly these things can get.It is true that Christinia's hamster died recently, but it is absolutely not true that it died at Chrissy's hand. At no time has Chrissy ever put Hambone or any of her previous hamsters in the microwave, dryer, or dishwasher. What kind of child would make up something like that?It sounds-- and I say this respectfully, so I hope you won't be offended-- like Fatima has had a very hard time getting acclimated here, and that's understandable. But I do hope you will deal with her before any such incidents become frequent. Children who start lying young often end up with long-time patterns of dishonesty.All best, Dr. Lucinda Johnston, PsyD Licensed Therapist. Welcome Wagon, Westwood Primary School, Events Coordinator, Jack and Jill, Claremont Branch.(SUBJECT) ERIKA ALEXANDER AS MONICA: Monday, October 7, 1991. Dear Lucinda, I apologize for my late reply, but I only found your letter at the bottom of Fatima's backpack when I did my weekly cleaning. Thank you for writing to me.Fatima says she only repeated what Christinia herself told her. Many of Fatima's stories about Christinia this year and last, which I won't recount here, have been disturbing, to say the least. But none as disturbing as Christinia's enjoyment of torturing rodents.Fatima has a strong imagination and writes beautiful lyric poetry, which she started reading at age four. But she does not have a history of lying or telling gruesome stories. And unlike Christinia, she has no history of running off with other girls' shoes while their feet dangle from the monkey bars.I appreciate your concerns about Fatima. And even though Christinia has made it much more difficult for her to find friends at Westwood, Fatima will acclimate soon. She's going to a sleepover at Emily's this weekend. Is Christinia going? If so, I hope you will encourage her to play nice.Best, Monica Willis, PhD. PS-- it is true that liars who start young often end up with psychological and social problems of the sort that Christinia has demonstrated over the past year. How lucky for you and Christinia that she has access to psychotherapy through your practice.(SUBJECT) EISA DAVIS AS LUCINDA: Dear Monica, I never expected so much defensiveness when I wrote my original letter. Perhaps you misread it. All I wanted to emphasize is that I understand why a girl in Fatima's position and one with her background would make up such stories.It's hard to get attention in a new place. There is probably some petty jealousy going on. But I think we can resolve this. I don't know how you did things at Fatima's old school-- in Fresno, was it? But here, we try to help the children work through their problems without getting too involved.I suppose you already know, and have known all along, that Christinia will not attend Emily's party, so there's no need for me to encourage her to "play nice." You've probably heard that history already, so I won't rehash it. But I will say that it wasn't Chrissy's fault that Emily broke her nose when she fell.Finally, and I say this respectfully, but maybe it would be wise to go through Fatima's backpack every night instead of once in a blue moon. I have heard from more than one parent that it smells like eggs. My best, Dr. Lucinda Johnston, Licensed Therapist, author ofTrainUpaChild.(SUBJECT) ERIKA ALEXANDER AS MONICA: Dear Lucinda-- or should I say Dr. Johnston-- I'd like to resolve this as much as you would, but that won't happen if all your letters begin and end with backbiting. I'm not of the mind that the only two Black children in the class should be enemies, nor do I like the attention it draws to them or their parents when they're already in a difficult position.I would think that a Black woman of your stature and success would understand how isolating work and school environments like Westwood can be for people like us. I hoped Christinia and Fatima could be friends and could support each other in this space. But it's been clear since second grade that you and Christinia are not willing to make that work.I'm sure Fatima would let Christinia into her growing inner circle, even her after-school reading club, if Christinia would only apologize and behave. Jealousy can become a lifelong problem. On that note, I hate to bring this up now, but we were surprised by how poorly Christinia behaved when Fatima's poem won over hers last year.I'd like to make sure that we don't end up with a repeat performance of that tantrum when the poetry competition rolls around this year. As for the hard-boiled egg, we resolved that last spring and bought Fatima a new backpack. And I believe you knew that already.Cheers. Dr. Monica Willis, PhD, author ofEveryVoiceCounts--HelpingChildrenofColorSucceedatPredominantlyWhiteSchools.(SUBJECT) EISA DAVIS AS LUCINDA: Monica, excuse the informal note. I think you're doing both yourself and Fatima a great injustice by continually emphasizing her brilliance over other children. Lots of people skip grades, and skipping kindergarten isn't something to brag about.I doubt that the standards at her old school were as rigorous as those at Westwood. What exactly was she advanced at? Nap time? If you'll recall, moreover, I was there at the recital where Fatima read her award-winning poem. And while my doctorates-- yes, plural-- may not be in literature, I'm pretty sure hardly anyone would call "Butterfly Pie" a work of poetic genius.You can't rhyme "pie" with "pie" multiple times and call that poetry. You just can't, even if you have the excuse of only being in fourth grade. Isn't your degree, by the way, an EdD? Lucinda.(SUBJECT) ERIKA ALEXANDER AS MONICA: Lucinda, I'm not surprised that Fatima's subtle wordplay was lost on you, since it's clear reading problems run in the family. Not everyone is suited for literary work. I'm sure you know that from your own writing struggles and the extra effort you had to put behind your research in order for anyone to take it seriously.Isn't there still some kind of issue with your last project and the IRB? Or is the issue with Dr. Patel's ex-wife? My very best, Monica.(SUBJECT) EISA DAVIS AS LUCINDA: Monica, I'm not going to dignify most of your comments with a response. This will be my last letter because I can see I'm not going to get anywhere with you. There's some kind of blockage there that I really think you should explore with a licensed professional, especially if you call yourself a professor.At one time, I wondered if we were too harsh in recommending that you and your family wait another year before joining our Jack and Jill chapter. But I can see now that we were right. I'm afraid I can never recommend you for our club. You display a volatile combination of residual ghetto and uppity negress. And that will be your undoing, if Fatima isn't.Sincerely, Dr. Lucinda M Johnston, Licensed Therapist, author ofTrainUpaChild,Welcome Wagon Westwood Primary School, Events Coordinator, Jack and Jill, Claremont Chapter.(SUBJECT) ERIKA ALEXANDER AS MONICA: Lucinda, I'm not even going to respond to that. But I will say that if someone here is uppity, it's the one of us with two little brats who have run off three au pairs. Who even uses that term if they're not French, and I'm pretty sure your cousin Shaquana isn't? They're nannies. Nannies!And if they're your own relative, then they're just babysitters, or bums who need a hookup. This bourginess and the way it keeps you from connecting with your kids is half of your problem. The other half you probably can't fix without medication. Good thing you can write prescriptions. Oh wait, you're not that kind of doctor.How can I be uppity when I've never had any help and started out as a single parent before marrying Jordan? If putting myself through school and becoming the highest-educated person in my family with no help but God's makes me uppity, then so be it. We are humble people, in spite of our education and finances, and we have more class in our excrement than you have in your whole hamster-murdering family.And yes, there is a bit of ghetto still left in me, enough to tell you who can finish the fight if it gets to that point. We're never too far from Oakland or the South Side. Let's keep it real. Monica.(SUBJECT) EISA DAVIS AS LUCINDA: Monica, I do believe that was a threat. The Claremont Police Department will not take this lightly. And tell Fatima to stop pinning notes to the inside of Chrissy's bookbag when she's not looking. Chrissy could injure herself on a dirty safety pin, knowing you people, and end up with Hepatitis A, B, or C, or worse.I've tried to resolve our differences by working directly and exclusively with you and their teacher, Mrs. Watson. But I will have no choice but to contact Principal Lee, in addition to the police, if this persists. Lucinda.(SUBJECT) ERIKA ALEXANDER AS MONICA: Lucinda, only you would suggest something so disgusting as intentionally injuring a child with a dirty safety pin. But then again, it was Christinia who put that tack on Renee Potts's chair last year and caused her to need a tetanus shot. Perverse minds think alike, apparently. Lose my number and address, and stop making your kid do your dirty work. M.(SUBJECT) EISA DAVIS AS LUCINDA: Monica, turn blue, turn blue, turn blue, blue, blue. Look, I've written a poem. Perhaps I should send it toLadybugmagazine. Love, Lucinda.(SUBJECT) ERIKA ALEXANDER AS MONICA: Lucinda, you need Jesus. Do not write me again or I will contact my lawyer. I've asked Mrs. Watson to check Fatima's backpack for correspondence from you, and I have made it clear that I do not want further contact from you or Christinia.You are not to speak to Fatima either. I'm requesting a meeting with the school and you and your husband so that we can nip this crazy mess in the bud once and for all. Monica. Jack and Jill, Claremont Chapter.(SUBJECT) ALVIN MELATHE AS PRINCIPAL LEE: October 21, 1991. Dear Mrs. Johnston and Mrs. Willis, it has come to my attention that your respective daughters, Christinia and Fatima, engaged in a brutal fistfight at school. As you know, this behavior violates not only the Westwood code of conduct, but also our core values as a school, and is punishable by expulsion. I am sending this letter as a followup to the discussion I had with each of you over the phone.I would like to meet with the two of you and Mrs. Watson, ASAP. My secretary will schedule. Sincerely, Principal Lee, Westwood Primary and Secondary School.October 25, 1991. Dear Drs. Willis, the school's board and I thank you for your generous donation and for agreeing to serve on the Westwood Welcome Wagon. Given the sharp improvement of your child's behavior, we can agree to rescind our threat of Fatima's expulsion from school. The reputation of our school depends on the efforts of involved parents like yourselves. Sincerely, Principal Lee.(SUBJECT) ERIKA ALEXANDER AS MONICA: November 3, 1991. Lucinda, thank you for inviting Fatima to Chrissy's party. She will be happy to attend. And thank you for the lovely fruit basket.(CHUCKLING) You're so bad. It's true, Mrs. Watson looks terrible in that color, and yet Principal Lee finds reasons to look. But I won't say anything more in writing. Jordan and I will discuss the Jack and Jill potluck with you when we see you.
