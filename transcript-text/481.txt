She's learning English. And once a week, one of her teachers from the City High School in Tuscon, Sarah Bromer, takes her to Ike's coffee shop to practice a simple English conversation.It goes like this-- Rediet orders tea. That's it, actually. That's the whole thing. Usually, they walk past the door four or five times before she even gets the courage to go inside to do this. And they rehearse beforehand.Sarah BromerSo she's going to go-- she calls everybody hon. Do you know what that means? Like honey?Rediet SeifuYeah.Ira GlassToday, for the very first time, Ms. Bromer is making Rediet order without her help.Sarah BromerShe might say, hey, hon, what do you want? Or I bet she'll say, hey, hon, what can I get for you? You'll say--Rediet SeifuI would like a tea, please.Sarah BromerAnd then what if she says, what? What? Pardon me?Rediet SeifuA tea. You confused me.Ira GlassMs. Bromer's actually teasing Rediet by saying, "What?" She knows that this is Rediet's biggest fear, that people will not understand her, that they're going to say, what? What? What was that?Sarah BromerWell, that's what you're afraid of, right?Rediet SeifuYou confused me.Sarah BromerYou're afraid, right, you're going to say, can I have a tea? And then she's going to go, what? What?Rediet SeifuTea.Sarah BromerNo, you're saying it just fine. She's going to know what you want. I'm just kidding. You'll say, I want a tea.Rediet SeifuOK. I want a tea.Sarah BromerGood. She'll say, what kind do you want?Rediet SeifuHoneybush tea.Sarah BromerHuh?[GIGGLING]Ira GlassOK, they practice a few more times. And then, finally, Rediet approaches the counter.Rediet SeifuHello.BaristaHi.Man 1Have a good one.BaristaBye, guys.Rediet SeifuI would like a tea, please.BaristaI'm sorry?Ira GlassOK, I just have to stop the tape right there. Did you hear? It happened. Exactly what she feared. The lady didn't understand her.And listen how she handles this. She's so good. Let's take that from the top again.Rediet SeifuI would like a tea, please.BaristaI'm sorry?Rediet SeifuI would like a tea, please.BaristaSure.Sarah BromerHot tea.BaristaHot tea?Rediet SeifuYeah.BaristaDo you know which kind you'd like, sweetheart?Rediet SeifuYeah, honeybush tea.BaristaHoneybush?Rediet SeifuYeah.BaristaAnything else?Sarah BromerNo.BaristaOK.Ira GlassShe doesn't giggle. She doesn't panic. She's perfect.Barista$1.69.Ira GlassIt's her first time buying something by herself in the US.BaristaAnd $0.06 is your change, honey.Ira GlassWelcome to America, Rediet. You bought something. You're engaging in commerce. You're talking to the lady at the counter.We are so glad to have you here. Have some tea. You'll be paying for it yourself.Rediet SeifuI'm not scared.Sarah BromerYou're not?Rediet SeifuYeah.Sarah BromerReally? You felt brave?Rediet SeifuYeah.Sarah BromerWell, I think you did a really good job.Rediet SeifuYeah, I think. Yeah.Ira GlassI'm Ira Glass. This week on our radio program, we're trying something unusual for us. This is the second time we've done this. Instead of our usual picking a theme and finding stories on the theme, the theme this week will simply be the week, the week that we all just lived through, these past seven days. Everything on the show has just happened, including stories that are so small and personal-- like, you know, Rediet ordering her first tea-- that they would never belong on a regular news show.And we have stories that are bigger, too, like this next woman, whose husband is Syrian. They lived there again in Syria till January, when it got too unstable. And she came to America, where she grew up. And then something bad happened.WomanI don't know. Really, I don't believe this could be happening. It seems like something that would happen in movies or in a book. We're just normal people.Ira GlassHer husband's still in Syria. He owns some businesses there. And two of their employees were taken hostage by the rebel forces who are fighting President Bashar al-Assad. President Obama has called for him to step down, of course, on Thursday. The Pentagon warned him not to use chemical weapons.Ira GlassDid you talk to your husband today?WomanYeah, I did.Ira GlassWhat's the very latest?WomanHe told me this morning they said that they would accept $80,000, and my husband said OK.Ira GlassAnd you and I are talking on Wednesday.WomanYes. Yeah, I mean, I think their objective is to get the money and hopefully not to kill somebody in between.Ira GlassAnd it must make you feel so strange to feel like, oh, and these people who you guys are negotiating with, those are the US allies in the war.WomanYeah. They're trying to clean up their act and get rid of this type of stuff, or appear like that. And I don't know--Ira GlassSo have you spent most of this week just, like, on pins and needles just to hear what the next thing is with these employees?WomanYeah. I haven't slept because of this. So hopefully-- I don't know if you are familiar with how things work in the Middle East, but everything always takes forever.Naderev SanoWe don't really have 25 days. We have a few precious hours left. We are at a critical juncture.Ira GlassIn Doha, Qatar, this week, at the latest United Nations Climate Change Conference, the main goal that they were trying to achieve seemed incredibly modest. The things that the world originally negotiated in 1997 in Kyoto about climate change are about to expire. If all goes as planned, the delegates here hope to recommit to them.But their bigger mission-- for instance, limiting the increase in world temperature to 2 degrees Celsius, which the world's governments committed to in 2009 in Copenhagen-- is starting to seem impossible, meaning more hurricane Sandys, more drought, more floods more frequently. A typhoon called Bopha hit the Philippines on Tuesday with a death toll that'll probably be twice that of Hurricane Sandy. This man speaking is the lead negotiator from the Philippines, Naderev Sano, giving a speech that becomes, as you'll hear, very unusual for this deeply bureaucratic, diplomatic setting.Naderev SanoAn important backdrop for my delegation is the profound impacts of climate change that we are already confronting. And as we see here, every single hour, even as we vacillate and procrastinate here, we are suffering. Madam Chair, we have never had a typhoon like Bopha, which has wreaked havoc in a part of the country that has never seen a storm like this in half a century.Finally, Madam Chair, I'm making an urgent appeal, not as a negotiator, not as a leader of my delegation, but as a Filipino. I appeal to the whole world. I appeal to the leaders from all over the world to open our eyes to the stark reality that we face. I appeal to ministers.The outcome of our work is not about what our political masters want. It is about what is demanded of us by 7 billion people. I appeal to all-- please, no more delays. No more excuses. Please, let Doha be remembered as the place where we found the political will to turn things around.Michael McgillNo choo-choo out of the train. No train whistle in the train. No doorbells.Ira GlassAs we poured gases into the atmosphere that are slowly heating the planet, threatening our very existence, we also put on plays for children and the disabled this week. In Montana, the Missoula Community Theatre prepared a special performance of the musicalMiracleon34thStreetfor people on the autism spectrum. This meant no sudden loud noises, lower lights, volunteers with glow sticks signaling when to applaud, and lower sound levels in general. Director Michael McGill discussed the changes with the cast before the show.Michael McgillYoung people, when you come out for Donald Duck, you come out quickly, but you don't scream.WomanJust know that Mrs. Sawyer's going to be very quiet in the trial scene.[GROANING]EmceeOK, here we go. Our first group coming up. We've got Hype-- Hyphen. Y'all give it up for Hyphen. They're doing some step for us today. Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up.Ira GlassAt the Best of Both Worlds Dance and Step Competition in Charlottesville, Virginia, Akayla Brown, Aquasia Baker, and Destiny Grady, ages 10, 10, and 11, told reporter Eric Mennel that they were confident of winning, even though they were competing against college kids.Akayla BrownAnd I think they'd be like, oh, we can just beat the little kids and this and that. They just think that they can just get in our Kool-Aid when they don't even know the flavor.Aquasia BakerOoh! That's a good one, [INAUDIBLE]Ira GlassThat same day, in Newark, New Jersey, a stranger on the train that carries you between terminals at Newark Airport got into the Kool-Aid of a man named James Braly, asking where he was headed.James BralyI am on my way to meet my brother-- or my half-brother, depending on how you look at it. The internet is a very, very strange thing.ManOh, really?James BralyYes.ManFirst day?James BralyFor the first time.ManSeriously?James BralyI'm absolutely serious.Ira GlassThe half-brother, Jan, who is from Norway, recently learned the name of his father for the very first time, did an internet search, discovered James' family in the United States, and was coming to meet them. The guy on the train asked James, what proof do you have? You going to get a DNA test or something?James BralyUh, not unless he asks me for a lot of money.Ira GlassWhen James gets to terminal A, he scans the crowd and spots him.James BralyI think that's him.Ira GlassHis half-brother's a 52-year-old man with a waxed handlebar mustache, hair thinned from chemo, and his dad's eyes. He is instantly recognizable, James says, as family.James BralyCan I get you a drink?Ira GlassWelcome to WBEZ Chicago. It'sThisAmericanLife,distributed by Public Radio International. Coming up all this hour, stories of all kinds, from all over, all from the past seven days. Stay with us.Act One: Kabul, AfghanistanIra GlassThis past Saturday, the first of the seven days that we're covering in today's show, I Skyped with Hyder Akbar-- he's in Kabul, Afghanistan-- to find out if anything was happening there that might be interesting for the radio. Hyder's been on our show a few times. He grew up in California, but his family is from Afghanistan. After college, Hyder moved there.He said that one of the guys that he's close to, Josef, was thinking about traveling to Kunar Province. That's where he's from. This is an area that's been a Taliban stronghold in the past. It's on the border with Pakistan.If the Afghan government were to lose control of the country to the Taliban, it would probably start in Kunar. And that's a real possibility-- civil war, the government falling. So what's happening in Kunar right now tells us whether that is in the cards in the future.Hyder AkbarLet me grab Josef, who's here, who actually was trying to get my dad to let him go back home tomorrow. I can bring him in here and talk to him about what's going on.Ira GlassThat seems great. Yeah, bring him in.Hyder AkbarWhat are you doing when you [INAUDIBLE]? OK, just a second. Let me--Ira GlassSo Josef shows up.Hyder Akbar[SPEAKING ARABIC].Ira GlassAnd Hyder asks him what's happening in Kunar right now.Josef[SPEAKING ARABIC].Hyder AkbarOh. Oh. He says the most interesting thing is that the Americans have just pulled out of an area called Pashangar, in his area, where there was almost like a local militia with them and then the Americans controlling them. And they pulled out of that base. And now the problems have started.And they're warning everybody, they're telling everybody, look, the Americans are leaving. The Americans are out. We're coming for you guys. We're going to go after whoever cooperated with the Afghan government, with the Americans. You guys better be careful. And they've started attacking the Afghan National Army. That, he says, is the main thing going on right now.Ira GlassWow.Hyder AkbarThere might be a chance to get interesting audio there, too, that this might be of interest. So let's see. Let's see.Ira GlassSo they went to see, in an ancient Toyota Corolla. They drove up there. They'd have to be careful, stay under the radar. A few days before, Hyder said, a few guys with the Afghan National Army were stopped on the road coming from Kunar and killed.They left on Tuesday. They were going to be back Tuesday night or Wednesday morning. Our plan was to talk again 6 o'clock Wednesday night, Kabul time.Then, Wednesday, Hyder wasn't answering any emails or any phone calls. 6 o'clock came and went. I started to get worried. And then, after an hour or so, I saw that he was online, on Skype. So I tried him.[RING][SKYPE CALL STARTING]Hyder AkbarHello?Ira GlassHyder?Hyder AkbarHey, Ira.Ira GlassSo it's Wednesday, and you just got back from Kunar Province.Hyder AkbarYes, I did. I just got back from Kunar. This was probably the most intense experience of my life a few hours ago. So that's kind of at the forefront of my mind.Ira GlassWhat happened?Hyder AkbarI was coming back with a story. And I was very excited, driving down, taking in the view of Kunar, which is actually very scenic. So I had my headphones on. And I'm driving down.And I have Josef, who lives with me now and works with me. And Sartor, who you've been introduced to through the previous documentaries, was sitting in the back. And I wanted to drive myself.And we were coming by this bend in the road where it slows down a little bit. And we were passing by that bend when, all of a sudden, somebody jumped up behind this wall. He jumped up behind the wall, and he tried stopped the car. He put his hand on the car twice, like-- [BANGING] --and yelled, stop.And I had my headphones on, so I just looked through the corner of my eye. And I see confusion. And I see Josef next to me, yelling, go go, go! And I looked at him, and he had his AK-47 pointed straight at us.When he had his AK-47 pointed straight at us and I saw that, I just floored the accelerator. I floored the accelerator, and I was like, oh, not time to stop. And my music was still going on in my ears.And then, all of a sudden, I just see firing. And they had a few men on that side of the road firing at our car, and then a few men on the other side of the road, as well, too, firing at our car. They're just emptying into our car.Josef is ducked down. Sartor is ducked down in the back. I had my head up, because I have to look at the road. Here, the tires go flat. They hit both tires. And as they hit both tires, I'm kind of looking up and trying to still make it. We're probably going a few hundred meters past them now.And then, all of a sudden, I see another person jump out. And he had an RPG in his hand. And he's looking right at me, and I'm looking right at him. And he shot the RPG right at me. He shot the RPG at me.And I'm seeing this rocket come towards me, and I'm like, OK, it's fine. I've done enough here. I had a pretty fun life. Obviously, all of that went through my mind. I was like, OK, it's done. It's done. I'm done.And the RPG-- this is why everybody was so shocked. So at that second, we hit like a little bump on the road. And the RPG goes straight through the engine of my car, instead of coming directly at me. So it hits the engine right in front of me.Ira GlassAnd is the car on fire? Are you in danger of the car blowing up?Hyder Akbar[INAUDIBLE] the engine on fire at this point. [INAUDIBLE] being able to take a picture later on. I could probably email this to you later on. But I'm going to show you on webcam real quick. You might be able to get a sense of how damaged it was and--Ira GlassOK. All right, you're holding this up to the webcam. We're talking over Skype.Hyder AkbarYeah. Can you see the car?Ira GlassOh my god. So the whole front is dented in. And then is the windshield busted in? It's hard to see.Hyder AkbarEverything's busted in. The whole car went on fire. Do you see that hole right there?Ira GlassYeah. So there's a huge hole in the driver's side in the front, on the hood.Hyder Akbar[INAUDIBLE] right now. Yeah, that's where the RPG went through. And you're looking at it in reverse right now, I think, because of the cam. But that's basically where I was sitting, right above it.And that's where the RPG came through. And that's where I missed the bump of the RPG. I mean, he was aiming straight at me. Like I said, when I saw that RPG come at me, I thought it was done. So--Ira GlassSo the car is on fire. You guys are in the car. These guys are shooting just a couple of hundred meters behind you. And maybe have they stopped at that point?Hyder AkbarSo at this point, it's quiet for a second. We're all kind of looking around. Right then, these two pickup trucks of ANA soldiers are driving by on the opposite side, going in their direction.Ira GlassThis is the Afghan army. This is friendly to you--Hyder AkbarThe Afghan National Army, yeah. So we see the Afghan National Army, two pickup trucks, plenty of guys in there. So we're like, OK-- phew-- coast clear. The ANA's going to be able to take care of this. And we get kind of relieved for a second.We get out of the car, we just see the ANA drive off. They saw it. They saw our car on fire. They definitely heard the RPG his us, because that doesn't make low noise.They heard the gunfire. And they just drive off. They just drive off, and I'm like, OK. All right.Ira GlassThey drive off in the direction of the guys who are shooting at you, or just in some other direction?Hyder AkbarNo, past them. Past them. Past them. They were driving in that direction, and they kept driving. So at this point, Josef just runs off. Josef has run off. He's a good hundred meters away from us at this point.And me and Sartor are kind of just looking at the car on fire, and we're like, what the hell? And we're looking at it, and Josef's screaming, get the hell out of here! Get the hell out of here!And I just looked at Sartor, and I was like, dude, my laptop bag's in there. Everything's in there. So we both run in. We open the door to go inside to grab the laptop bag out of it, with my laptop and other stuff in there.And so as we do that, they start firing again. Luckily, the car covered us. And the bullets just hit the back of the car as we were on the side of the car trying to get the laptop bag out. We managed to get the laptop bag out. And then I'm kind of hiding behind the car.I take out my iPhone, because I'm like, OK, I've got to record this a little bit, at least, for you guys. I was like, I want to record this thing. This is an interesting thing. I look at my iPhone. It has, like, 1% battery, 2%. I'm like, [BLEEP].So I have this on record, and I see Josef just come running back down. And it was kind of funny. He's like, what are you doing? I'm like, I need to record the car, I need to record the car for the thing. Remember, we came here to do the radio thing.And he cursed you guys out and punched the hood. And basically, he said, FThisAmericanLife.What the hell are you going to do withThisAmericanLifewhen you're dead? And he started dragging me away.And right then, the phone turned off too. The phone turned off too, so it didn't save the recording, either. And he's dragging me away. As he's dragging me away--Ira GlassOK, soon after this in the conversation, I let Hyder know that if he is ever again in any situation where he might get killed, it is OK if he runs away and stops recording for the radio show. So he explained that they went around the bend. They saw two civilian cars stopped there. They were still being shot at. So they got into those cars. They got away.This was the first time, Hyder said, that somebody specifically tried to kill him. And he thinks that they wanted him because they were letting other cars pass by on the road, and they specifically tried to stop his car. But who was it who was targeting him? And why were they targeting him? That wasn't clear to him at all.Hyder AkbarThat's something I'm going to have to think about and figure out tonight, in the next couple of days.Ira GlassWell, what are the possibilities? List through right now, tick off a couple of possibilities, just so I understand. What could it be?Hyder AkbarIt could have been the Taliban. It could have been the Taliban, who might have been following me a lot more closely than I realized, following my locations, where I'm spending the night, where I'm living. They definitely knew exactly where I was. I can't think of anything personal, in terms of any personal feuds, et cetera. So it'd be most likely the Taliban or people in Kunal that are with the insurgency that don't see me, I guess, as a threat.Ira GlassAnd Hyder, is it as simple as you and your dad aren't necessarily so crazy about the current government in Afghanistan, but they know you definitely do not like the Taliban? And is it as simple as that?Hyder AkbarAlmost as simple as that. The one thing I would add onto that is they could see us as being even more of a threat because we're not that close to this government anymore, because we don't approve of many things that are going on in the government. They can sideline a lot of other people very easily by saying, oh, these guys are corrupted individuals, involved with the government, fattening their pockets. But when they see me driving around in a [BLEEP] Corolla and just talking to people, engaging them, and being pretty sincere in my efforts, that's seen as much more of a threat, because they could delegitimize the Afghan government and the officials involved with them much easier.Ira GlassAnd it's not crazy to think that Hyder is now at a point where he would be worth killing. His family's from Kunar. His father and uncle were in the insurgency in Kunar that drove out the Soviets in the 1980s. When the current Afghan government came to power after September 11, Hyder's dad was appointed governor of Kunar. They have friends there. They have a base of support.And as the Americans pull out in the next two years, there's going to be a power vacuum in the country. And people are getting in position for that, including Hyder. He is setting himself up to do politics. The way that he explains it, he says he wants to be the Afghan equivalent of a congressman, though with a militia. You need a militia, because it's Afghanistan.We talked for a while. Hyder insisted that he is planning on going back to Kunar soon. And he's going to do it just like he did this time, in another beat-up old car, to prove that they didn't scare him, to prove that he wasn't going to stay away, which I really hope that his mom and his dad and his uncle talk him out of. And then we finally got to the reason for his trip in the first place, the story that he was so excited to bring back, that he ended up risking his life for, of what was happening in the province.Ira GlassSo just review the highlights for me. So let's talk about what you saw when you were there. What's interesting?Hyder AkbarOK, so we drove up there. We drove up there yesterday. And we went into the Pesh Valley.It's actually kind of funny. So the Pesh Valley's sort of like the valley of death. It was the place that was considered very dangerous. And some interesting new dynamics have emerged there with the ANA, the Afghan National Army.Ira GlassAgain, this is the government's army. This for the government of Afghanistan.Hyder AkbarThe ANA, the Afghan National Army, is in control there now. The Americans have pulled out. What's going on because of that is that a lot of people, especially the civilian population, is siding with the ANA now. The ANA is just culturally much more aware. They've been able to make inroads amongst the population.They've been able to push the Taliban out, especially from the main roads. I was driving by areas where people used to get stopped and beheaded, government officials or those considered working with the Americans, driving past all of these potholes in the road where they had laid down IEDs. And that was fine. It was fine. And we're all taking in the scenery.And it was a very heartwarming story, actually. I was actually very excited to come back. I was kind of aware, I was like, OK, maybe good news is not always that fun to report about. I was like, but it'll be exciting to finally come back. And I was very hopeful and feeling pretty jolly.Ira GlassBecause it was so hopeful that the Afghan National Army was doing a decent job?Hyder AkbarExactly. Exactly, that there's hope for this country, there's hope for security in this country, there's hope for stability in this country. And as somebody who has spent the last 10 years involved in this place, that was incredible news for me.Ira GlassHyder Akbar. He's the author of  the bookComeBacktoAfghanistan.This song that's playing right now is one that he swears was playing on his iPod when he was ambushed. And it's such a weird choice that it's hard to believe that he'd make that up. It's the Geto Boys' 1991 hit, "Mind Playing Tricks On Me."[MUSIC - "MIND PLAYING TRICKS ON ME" BY GETO BOYS]Act Two: Tucson, ArizonaIra GlassWell, if you live in a part of the country that has already had snow this year, you may find it hard to relate to the thrill experienced by some people in Arizona this past week. Lisa Pollak explains.Lisa PollakWhen I heard that an outdoor mall in Tuscon was promising snow on Saturday, a day when the high temperature hit 77 degrees, I figured there were only two possible explanations-- a pre-Christmas meteorological miracle or a ski resort style snow machine. But there was, in fact, a third option. I heard about it from Melanie Sutton, the senior marketing manager at La Encantada mall, the mall that sponsors the annual event known as the Enchanted Snowfall. She said that what we were about to see falling from sky that night was a desert style snow.Melanie SuttonAs our tagline, we say, "98% magic, 2% soap."Lisa PollakOh, wow. So it literally is, like, that's the ingredient, is soap? I mean, besides the magic.Melanie SuttonCorrect. The ingredient is soap. But they're shaped as snowflakes.Lisa PollakGot that? Me, neither. But minutes later, along with hundreds of parents and kids in the mall's open-air courtyard, I had a chance to see it for myself.Dad 1Oh, oh, here we go.Lisa Pollak"Oh, oh, here we go," I heard one of the dads say. Then there was a whooshing sound, followed by white stuff falling from the sky.Child 1It's snowing!Lisa PollakFrom a distance, I can report that it did indeed resemble snow-- heavy, white flakes lit up by spotlights in the darkness. Up close, though, it was hard to be fooled. Imagine little clumps of bath suds or globs of latte foam, with a faintly fresh smell.Dad 2There it is, look!Lisa PollakThis man is talking to his three-year-old son, Cameron, who at first seemed to be saying how much he liked the snow--CameronI don't like snow.Dad 2You like snow.Lisa Pollak--but on closer examination, was actually saying how much he didn't like the snow.CameronDon't like snow.Dad 2It's OK.CameronI don't like snow.Dad 2It's OK.Lisa PollakCameron was the exception. All around me, kids seemed to be going insane with joy. Over by the Apple store, a group of them had planted themselves under one of the faux snow machines and seemed to be trying to get as much white foam on their hair and clothes as possible. Others ran around with outstretched hands, trying to catch enough to make mushy snowballs and smash it on each other's heads.[CHILD LAUGHING]Child 2My hair!Lisa PollakOne boy walked up to me with a mass of suds in each hand and a look on his face like he couldn't believe his good fortune.Boy 1Look at how much snow I have.Lisa PollakSuddenly I felt a sense of duty. Shouldn't these kids know the truth? I would break it to them gently.Lisa PollakIt looks kind of like soap.Boy 1That's because it is soap. It's kind of like regular snow. But if it gets in your eyes, your eyes just terribly burn. It's just bubbles, but I can't believe it! I've never seen this happen before!Child 3So fun! And it's soap!Boy 2I tasted it. It tastes like soap.Lisa PollakAbout halfway through the show, I noticed I was starting to cough. And I wasn't the only one. I overheard this lady talking to her husband. Everyone's coughing, she said.Man 4We're all going to get cancer.Lisa PollakWhat did you say?Man 4We're all going to get cancer.Lisa PollakWhy did you say-- [COUGHS]Man 4Just listen. Everybody's standing here coughing, right? So it can't be good for you.Lisa Pollak[COUGHS]Man 4Yeah. Right? There you go. There you go. Get you some.Lisa PollakI checked with Melanie, the mall's marketing manager. She assured me that whatever was in the bubbles had been tested and was nontoxic. Though I believed her, I was a little relieved when the Enchanted Snowfall powered down after 15 minutes. Like a lot of things about the holidays, it was at its best from a distance, and a little went a long way.Ira GlassLisa Pollak. Coming up, a guy walks into a bar-- usually not a life-or-death situation. That's in a minute from Chicago Public Radio and Public Radio International when our program continues.Act Three: Washington, D.C.Ira GlassIt'sThisAmericanLife.I'm Ira Glass. This week, instead of the usual sort of theme we do on our show, our theme is just the seven days that have just passed. We have stories, small and personal, and big and national, and international.Monday, you probably heard, House Speaker John Boehner issued his counterproposal to avoid the fiscal cliff. It was promptly rejected by the White House. By Wednesday, there were front-page stories that Republican leaders are considering a fallback plan to extend tax cuts to the middle class now, fight about the rest of it in January or February.Also this week, Boehner cracked the whip in his own party. Republicans who didn't vote his way lost committee assignments. He warned to other House members that he would be watching. To put all of this in perspective, I called veteran Congress-watcher Norman Ornstein, who happened to be in Prague when I phoned him. His official title is Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.Norman OrnsteinBut all I care about is that you mention the book--Ira GlassAnd the title of the book is?Norman Ornstein--which is,It'sEvenWorseThanItLooks--HowtheAmericanConstitutionalSystemCollidedwiththeNewPoliticsofExtremism.Ira GlassConsider it mentioned.Norman OrnsteinOK.Ira GlassSo you're in Prague this week. Isn't this kind of a big week not to be near Capitol Hill for somebody like you?Norman OrnsteinIt's a good week to be away from Capitol Hill in a lot of ways.Ira GlassHow so?Norman OrnsteinWell, it seems like a big week. But the fact is we're in the middle of an end game. And I've been kind of bemused by all of the focus on the every-minute maneuvering of Speaker John Boehner and President Obama, including a heavy focus on the fact that Boehner didn't pose for a picture with the President at the White House Christmas party.And there's one important principle to keep in mind. When does an end game end? At the end. And the end is not this week.Ira GlassAre you basically saying that this is a week we might as well ignore the news from Capitol Hill?Norman OrnsteinYes. I'm saying that there are naturally going to be people who follow every little twist and turn. But it doesn't really matter.Ira GlassSo this is the thing that I was wondering, is, when you look at this maneuvering, can you tell how it's going to play out?Norman OrnsteinThe answer is two-fold. The first part is, no, you can't tell how it's going to play out. But all of these ploys and, in some ways, histrionics are par for the course. So taking the temperature on any one of them doesn't really tell us that much.Now, what I would have to say, though, is the second point. And it's frankly a giant caveat here. We are going through the most dysfunctional politics I've seen in 43 years. So I think there's a pretty good chance we'll get a patchwork deal to get us past this dilemma before the end of the year.But I also think that there's a substantial chance, much higher than it would have been if we were looking at the process 20 years ago or 10 years ago, even 5 years ago, that we'll slip over into January. And it might take a jolt, a serious jolt, from the markets to bring us to some kind of conclusion here.Ira GlassNorman Ornstein. I asked him, why do they even bother going through the theater this week? Why not just skip to the part where they actually hammer out the deal? His answer, I thought, was interesting.He said that the Republicans need to demonstrate to Grover Norquist and Rush Limbaugh and all their own constituents that they tried everything, their back is against the wall, there was no other choice before they can raise taxes. The Democrats have their own version of it. They have to demonstrate to their base they had no choice but to cut entitlements before any deal. Both sides need to say no, he says, for a while.Act Four: New Orleans, LAIra GlassWednesday night, New Orleans, French Quarter. A 25-year-old blonde girl named Joni Cooper is going up to everybody in this bar, asking a question that you probably wouldn't expect to hear on a night out drinking.Joni CooperHey, guys.Bar Patron 1How are you?Joni CooperCan I come chat with you?Bar Patron 1Sure.Joni CooperWell, my name's Joni. And I'm here with NO/AIDS. We're doing free HIV testing today. Would y'all maybe be interested in getting tested tonight?Ira GlassNO/AIDS is an organization in Louisiana that works to prevent and reduce the spread of HIV and help treat people who are infected. Louisiana has the fourth highest estimated AIDS rate in the country. In 2011, nearly 60% of new HIV diagnoses in Louisiana were gay man. 74% were African Americans. So NO/AIDS tries to make finding at your HIV status as convenient as they possibly can, which means, for them, going into bars, asking people to put down their drink for 15 minutes, and come get tested. They get the results on the spot.Bar Patron 2It's my birthday, so--Joni Cooper[SCREAMS]. Happy birthday!Ira GlassJoni is pitching a group of guys who are out for their friend's 30th birthday. You might think this would not be a receptive crowd, but listen to what happens.Bar Patron 2You're doing it right now? Like, what time?Joni CooperWe're doing it right now.Bar Patron 2Let's do it.Joni CooperYou want to go?Bar Patron 2Let's go.Joni CooperAll right!Bar Patron 2Let's go. I'm going to get tested. You coming?Bar Patron 3Where?Bar Patron 2Right here, right now.Robin PearceYou catch someone by surprise. You kind of catch someone off guard, and they're like, oh, well, I guess it's here. I've never done it.Ira GlassRobin Pearce runs the testing program, which has testing sites all over New Orleans, not just in bars.Robin PearceThe statistic is that 1.2 million people in the United States are living with HIV, and one in five of them don't know they have it. So finding the people who don't know that they have HIV is the point of what we're doing.Ira GlassThe week that we're covering here today happened to begin with World AIDS Day. And thinking about that, we sent out a writer, Nathaniel Rich, to watch the HIV testing at one of the highest risk venues NO/AIDS tests at-- Club New Orleans, a five-story sex club for men in the center of the French Quarter, which means that this story might not be appropriate for all children or maybe any of them. It acknowledges the existence of sex. Here's Nathaniel. We changed the name of the guy he's writing about in this story.Nathaniel RichRoom 300 was the largest bedroom in the club, just large enough to fit a chair and a queen size bed covered with red satin sheets. Sitting cross-legged on the bed was Alex Lee, a 25-year-old counselor for NO/AIDS, who's also a student at the University of New Orleans. He's majoring in anthropology. In fact, he had a final exam the next morning.When Mark entered the room, Alex was reading an essay about Occam's razor. Alex asked Mark to sit in the chair. He explained that the HIV test would only detect an infection that occurred more than three months ago. He showed Mark how to use an applicator to swab this mouth-- first his upper gums, then his lower gums. When Mark was finished, he dipped the end of the applicator into a small vial.Alex set a timer to 20 minutes, the time it takes for a test result to appear, and placed it on the bedside table between them. He asked Mark a series of questions. "When was your last test?" "About a year ago," said Mark, "at a bar, in fact.""In the past 12 months," asked Alex, "have you had anal sex with a man?" "Yes," said Mark. "Have you had sex without using a condom?" "As a giver," said Mark. "How about sex with an anonymous, casual, or internet partner, someone you didn't know too well?" "I'm sure I have," said Mark.He seemed to become increasingly anxious. He crossed his arms, holding his elbows, hugging his chest. "Have you knowingly had sex with someone who's living with HIV?" "No." "Have you injected any drugs?" "No.""Have you had sex with someone who injects drugs?" Mark paused for two seconds. "No," he said. Alex started the next question, but Mark interrupted him. "Yes," he said, "yes, I have." "Sex with someone who injects drugs?" "Yeah. I just didn't know it until after."The timer beeped. "Does that mean it's ready?" asked Mark. "No," said Alex. "It just beeps sometimes.""It's so funny," said Mark, "and this is so crude, but I did have intercourse last night, not wearing a condom. It's just weird. The guy told me he was negative, but for some reason, after all was said and done, I thought he was really positive. And then I was thinking on the walk home how stupid that was."Mark had been busy all day at work, so it had been easy to avoid thinking about it. But that evening, he went for a walk and soon found himself standing in front of the club. It was odd, Mark said, because he hadn't visited the club for a year. As soon as he stepped inside, a voice came on the loudspeaker announcing that there would be free HIV testing that evening. Suddenly, Mark understood why he had come to the club, and he felt scared.There were five minutes left on the timer. "I'm really anxious," said Mark. He looked it. He was jittery. He rose from his chair. He said he was going to walk around and come back when his result was ready.But five minutes later, when the timer went off, Mark was gone. Alex waited another 10 minutes, then another 10. A different man was tested, waited for his result, then left. Still no sign of Mark.Alex was mystified. In his two years testing men at bars, nobody had ever fled before finding out his results. It was now almost 11:30. His shift had official ended half an hour ago, and his anthropology final was at 10:00 AM.As Alex gathered his testing materials, his colleague, Brandon, decided to make one final effort to find Mark. Brandon started in the gym. Mark wasn't there. Nor was Mark in the sauna or the whirlpool.He was not in the room called the Bookstore, which doesn't have any books, nor was he in the Barracks. He was not in the so-called Porno Room, in which every surface is made of black rubber. And he was not in the Dungeon.Brandon paced through the narrow hallways, which are lined with more than 50 tiny bedrooms. Some of the doors were ajar. He saw harnesses and swings. He saw men watching videos.And then, in another bedroom, Brandon saw Mark. He was sitting on a bed, talking with a naked man. "Oh," said Mark, "are you looking for me?"Five minutes later, Mark returned to room 300. His fingers were trembling. He was too nervous to sit. Alex told him that his test had come back negative."Yay!" Mark shouted. He was ecstatic. He asked Alex to show him the result on the test form. "God, I'm so happy. Thank you. Oh my god."He thanked Alex a few more times and said he was grateful for the work that NO/AIIDS was doing. Mark even said he wanted to volunteer for the organization, that he felt, as a member of the New Orleans gay community, it was the right thing to do. Then, negative test results in hand, he disappeared into the club.Ira GlassNathaniel Rich.

Except for the Geto Boys, all the songs between stories today was a release or on albums that were released in the last seven days.Act Five: Cairo, EgyptIra GlassA week can be a long time, when every day seems to shift the direction of your entire country. Egypt has had a week of demonstrations, counter demonstrations, and violence. The demonstrations are for and against the country's president, Mohammed Morsi.And OK, quick review-- Morsi was democratically elected a couple months ago. But at the end of November, he shocked many Egyptians by issuing a decree giving himself enormous powers, basically putting all his decisions, past and present, above the law. He said he had to do this because judges appointed by Egypt's ousted dictator, Hosni Mubarak, were undermining him. Some of those judges had dissolved Egypt's newly elected parliament right before Morsi took office.So now, if you follow the news at all, you've seen this-- both sides are dug in, each convinced that they represent true democracy in Egypt. There are a lot of ways for things to get worse, very few for them to get better. Nancy Updike reports on what has happened and how some of the anger is being spread around.Nancy UpdikeUp until this past Wednesday, opponents and supporters of President Morsi had held their rallies in different places-- on purpose, to avoid confrontations. But late in the day on Wednesday, supporters of President Morsi, members of the Muslim Brotherhood, marched to the presidential palace, where some anti-Morsi protesters were camped out. And after that, all night long, people fought or ran or hid.By Thursday morning, seven people were dead, and hundreds were injured. And four of Morsi's advisers had resigned in protest. As of right now, Friday evening, around 6:00 PM Egypt time, the leaders of both sides aren't talking to each other, and protesters are still in the streets, separate and peaceful for the moment.When I was in Cairo after Mubarak was ousted last year, I saw a scene that now seems impossible-- writers and editors, secular Egyptians, who were talking over croissants with members of a formerly violent Islamist group named Gamaa Islamiya, an ally of the Muslim Brotherhood. The secular men and the devout men weren't becoming friends. But they weren't beating each other up in the streets, either.[PHONE RINGING]Yusuf Al-qaidHello?Interpreter[SPEAKING ARABIC].Nancy UpdikeOn Thursday night, I made a phone call through an interpreter. She was shouting a bit to make herself heard. And we called one of the people from that meeting, an Egyptian novelist in his 70s named Yusuf al-Qaid to find out his take on the week's events. He remembered me, but he wanted to make absolutely sure I knew where he stands in this fight.Yusuf Al-qaid[SPEAKING ARABIC].TranslatorI would like our American journalist here to understand that I am not in any neutral position here. I am with a civilian modern state. I am against a religious state. I am against any rule based on religion.Nancy UpdikeSo against Morsi. And since he brought up the fact that I'm American, I told al-Qaid that I'd seen pictures of anti-Morsi protesters, people like him, carrying signs talking about the US and President Obama. I didn't mention this specific one to him, but I saw a sign that said, "Obama, your bitch is our dictator." The vehemence of al-Qaid's response caught me by surprise.TranslatorIn my view, the biggest betrayal that has taken place against the Egyptian people is the absolute support that the American administration has given to the Muslim Brotherhood. America is ignoring the violence that is conducted against the Egyptian people. America is completely silent and has voiced that its relationship with Egypt is strategic. And therefore, passing events do not affect this strategic relationship.Nancy UpdikeBy strategic relationship, he means that the United States is more concerned about Egypt's dealings with Israel than about Egypt's dealings with its own citizens. This week, more than ever, I realized that no matter how angry and caught up in their own national issues a person is, depending on what country they're in, they probably still have plenty of anger left over for the United States.After I hung up with al-Qaid, I called another person I met in Cairo last year-- completely different guy, a religious man, young, 28 years old, named Mohammed Agiba. Mohammed spent years in the Muslim Brotherhood. But now he's marching against Morsi too. He knew Morsi's power grab would divide the country. And he thinks the proposed constitution is a disaster that has to be stopped.And talking about the constitution is when we ended up at the same place I ended up with al-Qaid, the secular guy. Mohammed talked about how the constitution calls for a joint civilian military council, weighted toward the military, that has to be consulted before the president can declare a war. The council also has a role in deciding on the military's budget. Mohammed sees the council as one thing only.Mohammed Agiba[SPEAKING ARABIC].TranslatorThis is what the US wants; this is what Israel wants-- a regime which appears to be democratic to the people, but actually it is this defense national council which will be doing all the work. This council, the National Defense Council, will be the one ruling the country.Nancy UpdikeSo are you saying you think President Morsi or part of his government or all of his government are puppets of the United States?Mohammed Agiba[SPEAKING ARABIC].TranslatorFor sure President Morsi wants the interests of Egypt. However, he sees the implementation of this interest, or finding the interest, from a very narrow perspective that the United States has set for him. We do not want him to see that perspective through the United States' perspective.We want him to see it through the Egyptian people's vision and through the Egyptian people's perspective. And we say, please, the Egyptian people should be your priority and not the American administration.Nancy UpdikeI asked Mohammed one more question, not about America, but about Egypt and the choices people have faced there since the revolution. I asked him if he'd voted for Morsi. He did, like a lot of people who are now protesting against Morsi.He said he doesn't regret it. The alternative was worse. He says he just hopes Morsi can pull out of this and pull Egypt out too.Ira GlassNancy Updike.

Back next week with more stories ofThisAmericanLife.AnnouncerPRI, Public Radio International.,PrologueIra GlassTuesday, Tucson, Arizona.Sarah BromerHow are you feeling?Rediet SeifuI'm scared.Ira GlassRediet Seifu moved to the United States from Ethiopia four months ago. She's learning English. And once a week, one of her teachers from the City High School in Tuscon, Sarah Bromer, takes her to Ike's coffee shop to practice a simple English conversation.It goes like this-- Rediet orders tea. That's it, actually. That's the whole thing. Usually, they walk past the door four or five times before she even gets the courage to go inside to do this. And they rehearse beforehand.Sarah BromerSo she's going to go-- she calls everybody hon. Do you know what that means? Like honey?Rediet SeifuYeah.Ira GlassToday, for the very first time, Ms. Bromer is making Rediet order without her help.Sarah BromerShe might say, hey, hon, what do you want? Or I bet she'll say, hey, hon, what can I get for you? You'll say--Rediet SeifuI would like a tea, please.Sarah BromerAnd then what if she says, what? What? Pardon me?Rediet SeifuA tea. You confused me.Ira GlassMs. Bromer's actually teasing Rediet by saying, "What?" She knows that this is Rediet's biggest fear, that people will not understand her, that they're going to say, what? What? What was that?Sarah BromerWell, that's what you're afraid of, right?Rediet SeifuYou confused me.Sarah BromerYou're afraid, right, you're going to say, can I have a tea? And then she's going to go, what? What?Rediet SeifuTea.Sarah BromerNo, you're saying it just fine. She's going to know what you want. I'm just kidding. You'll say, I want a tea.Rediet SeifuOK. I want a tea.Sarah BromerGood. She'll say, what kind do you want?Rediet SeifuHoneybush tea.Sarah BromerHuh?[GIGGLING]Ira GlassOK, they practice a few more times. And then, finally, Rediet approaches the counter.Rediet SeifuHello.BaristaHi.Man 1Have a good one.BaristaBye, guys.Rediet SeifuI would like a tea, please.BaristaI'm sorry?Ira GlassOK, I just have to stop the tape right there. Did you hear? It happened. Exactly what she feared. The lady didn't understand her.And listen how she handles this. She's so good. Let's take that from the top again.Rediet SeifuI would like a tea, please.BaristaI'm sorry?Rediet SeifuI would like a tea, please.BaristaSure.Sarah BromerHot tea.BaristaHot tea?Rediet SeifuYeah.BaristaDo you know which kind you'd like, sweetheart?Rediet SeifuYeah, honeybush tea.BaristaHoneybush?Rediet SeifuYeah.BaristaAnything else?Sarah BromerNo.BaristaOK.Ira GlassShe doesn't giggle.

You bought something. You're engaging in commerce. You're talking to the lady at the counter.We are so glad to have you here. Have some tea. You'll be paying for it yourself.Rediet SeifuI'm not scared.Sarah BromerYou're not?Rediet SeifuYeah.Sarah BromerReally? You felt brave?Rediet SeifuYeah.Sarah BromerWell, I think you did a really good job.Rediet SeifuYeah, I think. Yeah.Ira GlassI'm Ira Glass. This week on our radio program, we're trying something unusual for us. This is the second time we've done this. Instead of our usual picking a theme and finding stories on the theme, the theme this week will simply be the week, the week that we all just lived through, these past seven days. Everything on the show has just happened, including stories that are so small and personal-- like, you know, Rediet ordering her first tea-- that they would never belong on a regular news show.And we have stories that are bigger, too, like this next woman, whose husband is Syrian. They lived there again in Syria till January, when it got too unstable. And she came to America, where she grew up. And then something bad happened.WomanI don't know. Really, I don't believe this could be happening. It seems like something that would happen in movies or in a book. We're just normal people.Ira GlassHer husband's still in Syria. He owns some businesses there. And two of their employees were taken hostage by the rebel forces who are fighting President Bashar al-Assad. President Obama has called for him to step down, of course, on Thursday. The Pentagon warned him not to use chemical weapons.Ira GlassDid you talk to your husband today?WomanYeah, I did.Ira GlassWhat's the very latest?WomanHe told me this morning they said that they would accept $80,000, and my husband said OK.Ira GlassAnd you and I are talking on Wednesday.WomanYes. Yeah, I mean, I think their objective is to get the money and hopefully not to kill somebody in between.Ira GlassAnd it must make you feel so strange to feel like, oh, and these people who you guys are negotiating with, those are the US allies in the war.WomanYeah. They're trying to clean up their act and get rid of this type of stuff, or appear like that. And I don't know--Ira GlassSo have you spent most of this week just, like, on pins and needles just to hear what the next thing is with these employees?WomanYeah. I haven't slept because of this. So hopefully-- I don't know if you are familiar with how things work in the Middle East, but everything always takes forever.Naderev SanoWe don't really have 25 days. We have a few precious hours left. We are at a critical juncture.Ira GlassIn Doha, Qatar, this week, at the latest United Nations Climate Change Conference, the main goal that they were trying to achieve seemed incredibly modest. The things that the world originally negotiated in 1997 in Kyoto about climate change are about to expire. If all goes as planned, the delegates here hope to recommit to them.But their bigger mission-- for instance, limiting the increase in world temperature to 2 degrees Celsius, which the world's governments committed to in 2009 in Copenhagen-- is starting to seem impossible, meaning more hurricane Sandys, more drought, more floods more frequently. A typhoon called Bopha hit the Philippines on Tuesday with a death toll that'll probably be twice that of Hurricane Sandy. This man speaking is the lead negotiator from the Philippines, Naderev Sano, giving a speech that becomes, as you'll hear, very unusual for this deeply bureaucratic, diplomatic setting.Naderev SanoAn important backdrop for my delegation is the profound impacts of climate change that we are already confronting. And as we see here, every single hour, even as we vacillate and procrastinate here, we are suffering. Madam Chair, we have never had a typhoon like Bopha, which has wreaked havoc in a part of the country that has never seen a storm like this in half a century.Finally, Madam Chair, I'm making an urgent appeal, not as a negotiator, not as a leader of my delegation, but as a Filipino. I appeal to the whole world. I appeal to the leaders from all over the world to open our eyes to the stark reality that we face. I appeal to ministers.The outcome of our work is not about what our political masters want. It is about what is demanded of us by 7 billion people. I appeal to all-- please, no more delays. No more excuses. Please, let Doha be remembered as the place where we found the political will to turn things around.Michael McgillNo choo-choo out of the train. No train whistle in the train. No doorbells.Ira GlassAs we poured gases into the atmosphere that are slowly heating the planet, threatening our very existence, we also put on plays for children and the disabled this week. In Montana, the Missoula Community Theatre prepared a special performance of the musicalMiracleon34thStreetfor people on the autism spectrum. This meant no sudden loud noises, lower lights, volunteers with glow sticks signaling when to applaud, and lower sound levels in general. Director Michael McGill discussed the changes with the cast before the show.Michael McgillYoung people, when you come out for Donald Duck, you come out quickly, but you don't scream.WomanJust know that Mrs. Sawyer's going to be very quiet in the trial scene.[GROANING]EmceeOK, here we go.

Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up.Ira GlassAt the Best of Both Worlds Dance and Step Competition in Charlottesville, Virginia, Akayla Brown, Aquasia Baker, and Destiny Grady, ages 10, 10, and 11, told reporter Eric Mennel that they were confident of winning, even though they were competing against college kids.Akayla BrownAnd I think they'd be like, oh, we can just beat the little kids and this and that. They just think that they can just get in our Kool-Aid when they don't even know the flavor.Aquasia BakerOoh! That's a good one, [INAUDIBLE]Ira GlassThat same day, in Newark, New Jersey, a stranger on the train that carries you between terminals at Newark Airport got into the Kool-Aid of a man named James Braly, asking where he was headed.James BralyI am on my way to meet my brother-- or my half-brother, depending on how you look at it. The internet is a very, very strange thing.ManOh, really?James BralyYes.ManFirst day?James BralyFor the first time.ManSeriously?James BralyI'm absolutely serious.Ira GlassThe half-brother, Jan, who is from Norway, recently learned the name of his father for the very first time, did an internet search, discovered James' family in the United States, and was coming to meet them. The guy on the train asked James, what proof do you have? You going to get a DNA test or something?James BralyUh, not unless he asks me for a lot of money.Ira GlassWhen James gets to terminal A, he scans the crowd and spots him.James BralyI think that's him.Ira GlassHis half-brother's a 52-year-old man with a waxed handlebar mustache, hair thinned from chemo, and his dad's eyes. He is instantly recognizable, James says, as family.James BralyCan I get you a drink?Ira GlassWelcome to WBEZ Chicago. It'sThisAmericanLife,distributed by Public Radio International. Coming up all this hour, stories of all kinds, from all over, all from the past seven days. Stay with us.Act One: Kabul, AfghanistanIra GlassThis past Saturday, the first of the seven days that we're covering in today's show, I Skyped with Hyder Akbar-- he's in Kabul, Afghanistan-- to find out if anything was happening there that might be interesting for the radio. Hyder's been on our show a few times. He grew up in California, but his family is from Afghanistan. After college, Hyder moved there.He said that one of the guys that he's close to, Josef, was thinking about traveling to Kunar Province. That's where he's from. This is an area that's been a Taliban stronghold in the past. It's on the border with Pakistan.If the Afghan government were to lose control of the country to the Taliban, it would probably start in Kunar. And that's a real possibility-- civil war, the government falling. So what's happening in Kunar right now tells us whether that is in the cards in the future.Hyder AkbarLet me grab Josef, who's here, who actually was trying to get my dad to let him go back home tomorrow. I can bring him in here and talk to him about what's going on.Ira GlassThat seems great. Yeah, bring him in.Hyder AkbarWhat are you doing when you [INAUDIBLE]? OK, just a second. Let me--Ira GlassSo Josef shows up.Hyder Akbar[SPEAKING ARABIC].Ira GlassAnd Hyder asks him what's happening in Kunar right now.Josef[SPEAKING ARABIC].Hyder AkbarOh. Oh. He says the most interesting thing is that the Americans have just pulled out of an area called Pashangar, in his area, where there was almost like a local militia with them and then the Americans controlling them. And they pulled out of that base. And now the problems have started.And they're warning everybody, they're telling everybody, look, the Americans are leaving. The Americans are out. We're coming for you guys. We're going to go after whoever cooperated with the Afghan government, with the Americans. You guys better be careful. And they've started attacking the Afghan National Army. That, he says, is the main thing going on right now.Ira GlassWow.Hyder AkbarThere might be a chance to get interesting audio there, too, that this might be of interest. So let's see. Let's see.Ira GlassSo they went to see, in an ancient Toyota Corolla. They drove up there. They'd have to be careful, stay under the radar. A few days before, Hyder said, a few guys with the Afghan National Army were stopped on the road coming from Kunar and killed.They left on Tuesday. They were going to be back Tuesday night or Wednesday morning. Our plan was to talk again 6 o'clock Wednesday night, Kabul time.Then, Wednesday, Hyder wasn't answering any emails or any phone calls. 6 o'clock came and went. I started to get worried. And then, after an hour or so, I saw that he was online, on Skype. So I tried him.[RING][SKYPE CALL STARTING]Hyder AkbarHello?Ira GlassHyder?Hyder AkbarHey, Ira.Ira GlassSo it's Wednesday, and you just got back from Kunar Province.Hyder AkbarYes, I did. I just got back from Kunar. This was probably the most intense experience of my life a few hours ago. So that's kind of at the forefront of my mind.Ira GlassWhat happened?Hyder AkbarI was coming back with a story. And I was very excited, driving down, taking in the view of Kunar, which is actually very scenic. So I had my headphones on. And I'm driving down.And I have Josef, who lives with me now and works with me. And Sartor, who you've been introduced to through the previous documentaries, was sitting in the back. And I wanted to drive myself.And we were coming by this bend in the road where it slows down a little bit. And we were passing by that bend when, all of a sudden, somebody jumped up behind this wall. He jumped up behind the wall, and he tried stopped the car. He put his hand on the car twice, like-- [BANGING] --and yelled, stop.And I had my headphones on, so I just looked through the corner of my eye. And I see confusion. And I see Josef next to me, yelling, go go, go! And I looked at him, and he had his AK-47 pointed straight at us.When he had his AK-47 pointed straight at us and I saw that, I just floored the accelerator. I floored the accelerator, and I was like, oh, not time to stop. And my music was still going on in my ears.And then, all of a sudden, I just see firing. And they had a few men on that side of the road firing at our car, and then a few men on the other side of the road, as well, too, firing at our car. They're just emptying into our car.Josef is ducked down. Sartor is ducked down in the back. I had my head up, because I have to look at the road. Here, the tires go flat. They hit both tires. And as they hit both tires, I'm kind of looking up and trying to still make it. We're probably going a few hundred meters past them now.And then, all of a sudden, I see another person jump out. And he had an RPG in his hand. And he's looking right at me, and I'm looking right at him. And he shot the RPG right at me. He shot the RPG at me.And I'm seeing this rocket come towards me, and I'm like, OK, it's fine. I've done enough here. I had a pretty fun life. Obviously, all of that went through my mind. I was like, OK, it's done. It's done. I'm done.And the RPG-- this is why everybody was so shocked. So at that second, we hit like a little bump on the road. And the RPG goes straight through the engine of my car, instead of coming directly at me. So it hits the engine right in front of me.Ira GlassAnd is the car on fire? Are you in danger of the car blowing up?Hyder Akbar[INAUDIBLE] the engine on fire at this point. [INAUDIBLE] being able to take a picture later on. I could probably email this to you later on. But I'm going to show you on webcam real quick. You might be able to get a sense of how damaged it was and--Ira GlassOK. All right, you're holding this up to the webcam. We're talking over Skype.Hyder AkbarYeah. Can you see the car?Ira GlassOh my god. So the whole front is dented in. And then is the windshield busted in? It's hard to see.Hyder AkbarEverything's busted in. The whole car went on fire. Do you see that hole right there?Ira GlassYeah. So there's a huge hole in the driver's side in the front, on the hood.Hyder Akbar[INAUDIBLE] right now. Yeah, that's where the RPG went through. And you're looking at it in reverse right now, I think, because of the cam. But that's basically where I was sitting, right above it.And that's where the RPG came through. And that's where I missed the bump of the RPG. I mean, he was aiming straight at me. Like I said, when I saw that RPG come at me, I thought it was done. So--Ira GlassSo the car is on fire. You guys are in the car. These guys are shooting just a couple of hundred meters behind you. And maybe have they stopped at that point?Hyder AkbarSo at this point, it's quiet for a second. We're all kind of looking around. Right then, these two pickup trucks of ANA soldiers are driving by on the opposite side, going in their direction.Ira GlassThis is the Afghan army. This is friendly to you--Hyder AkbarThe Afghan National Army, yeah. So we see the Afghan National Army, two pickup trucks, plenty of guys in there. So we're like, OK-- phew-- coast clear. The ANA's going to be able to take care of this. And we get kind of relieved for a second.We get out of the car, we just see the ANA drive off. They saw it. They saw our car on fire. They definitely heard the RPG his us, because that doesn't make low noise.They heard the gunfire. And they just drive off. They just drive off, and I'm like, OK. All right.Ira GlassThey drive off in the direction of the guys who are shooting at you, or just in some other direction?Hyder AkbarNo, past them. Past them. Past them. They were driving in that direction, and they kept driving. So at this point, Josef just runs off. Josef has run off. He's a good hundred meters away from us at this point.And me and Sartor are kind of just looking at the car on fire, and we're like, what the hell? And we're looking at it, and Josef's screaming, get the hell out of here! Get the hell out of here!And I just looked at Sartor, and I was like, dude, my laptop bag's in there. Everything's in there. So we both run in. We open the door to go inside to grab the laptop bag out of it, with my laptop and other stuff in there.And so as we do that, they start firing again. Luckily, the car covered us. And the bullets just hit the back of the car as we were on the side of the car trying to get the laptop bag out. We managed to get the laptop bag out. And then I'm kind of hiding behind the car.I take out my iPhone, because I'm like, OK, I've got to record this a little bit, at least, for you guys. I was like, I want to record this thing. This is an interesting thing. I look at my iPhone. It has, like, 1% battery, 2%. I'm like, [BLEEP].So I have this on record, and I see Josef just come running back down. And it was kind of funny. He's like, what are you doing? I'm like, I need to record the car, I need to record the car for the thing. Remember, we came here to do the radio thing.And he cursed you guys out and punched the hood. And basically, he said, FThisAmericanLife.What the hell are you going to do withThisAmericanLifewhen you're dead? And he started dragging me away.And right then, the phone turned off too. The phone turned off too, so it didn't save the recording, either. And he's dragging me away. As he's dragging me away--Ira GlassOK, soon after this in the conversation, I let Hyder know that if he is ever again in any situation where he might get killed, it is OK if he runs away and stops recording for the radio show. So he explained that they went around the bend. They saw two civilian cars stopped there. They were still being shot at. So they got into those cars. They got away.This was the first time, Hyder said, that somebody specifically tried to kill him. And he thinks that they wanted him because they were letting other cars pass by on the road, and they specifically tried to stop his car. But who was it who was targeting him? And why were they targeting him? That wasn't clear to him at all.Hyder AkbarThat's something I'm going to have to think about and figure out tonight, in the next couple of days.Ira GlassWell, what are the possibilities? List through right now, tick off a couple of possibilities, just so I understand. What could it be?Hyder AkbarIt could have been the Taliban. It could have been the Taliban, who might have been following me a lot more closely than I realized, following my locations, where I'm spending the night, where I'm living. They definitely knew exactly where I was. I can't think of anything personal, in terms of any personal feuds, et cetera. So it'd be most likely the Taliban or people in Kunal that are with the insurgency that don't see me, I guess, as a threat.Ira GlassAnd Hyder, is it as simple as you and your dad aren't necessarily so crazy about the current government in Afghanistan, but they know you definitely do not like the Taliban? And is it as simple as that?Hyder AkbarAlmost as simple as that. The one thing I would add onto that is they could see us as being even more of a threat because we're not that close to this government anymore, because we don't approve of many things that are going on in the government. They can sideline a lot of other people very easily by saying, oh, these guys are corrupted individuals, involved with the government, fattening their pockets. But when they see me driving around in a [BLEEP] Corolla and just talking to people, engaging them, and being pretty sincere in my efforts, that's seen as much more of a threat, because they could delegitimize the Afghan government and the officials involved with them much easier.Ira GlassAnd it's not crazy to think that Hyder is now at a point where he would be worth killing. His family's from Kunar. His father and uncle were in the insurgency in Kunar that drove out the Soviets in the 1980s. When the current Afghan government came to power after September 11, Hyder's dad was appointed governor of Kunar. They have friends there. They have a base of support.And as the Americans pull out in the next two years, there's going to be a power vacuum in the country. And people are getting in position for that, including Hyder. He is setting himself up to do politics. The way that he explains it, he says he wants to be the Afghan equivalent of a congressman, though with a militia. You need a militia, because it's Afghanistan.We talked for a while. Hyder insisted that he is planning on going back to Kunar soon. And he's going to do it just like he did this time, in another beat-up old car, to prove that they didn't scare him, to prove that he wasn't going to stay away, which I really hope that his mom and his dad and his uncle talk him out of. And then we finally got to the reason for his trip in the first place, the story that he was so excited to bring back, that he ended up risking his life for, of what was happening in the province.Ira GlassSo just review the highlights for me. So let's talk about what you saw when you were there. What's interesting?Hyder AkbarOK, so we drove up there. We drove up there yesterday. And we went into the Pesh Valley.It's actually kind of funny. So the Pesh Valley's sort of like the valley of death. It was the place that was considered very dangerous. And some interesting new dynamics have emerged there with the ANA, the Afghan National Army.Ira GlassAgain, this is the government's army. This for the government of Afghanistan.Hyder AkbarThe ANA, the Afghan National Army, is in control there now. The Americans have pulled out. What's going on because of that is that a lot of people, especially the civilian population, is siding with the ANA now. The ANA is just culturally much more aware. They've been able to make inroads amongst the population.They've been able to push the Taliban out, especially from the main roads. I was driving by areas where people used to get stopped and beheaded, government officials or those considered working with the Americans, driving past all of these potholes in the road where they had laid down IEDs. And that was fine. It was fine. And we're all taking in the scenery.And it was a very heartwarming story, actually. I was actually very excited to come back. I was kind of aware, I was like, OK, maybe good news is not always that fun to report about. I was like, but it'll be exciting to finally come back. And I was very hopeful and feeling pretty jolly.Ira GlassBecause it was so hopeful that the Afghan National Army was doing a decent job?Hyder AkbarExactly. Exactly, that there's hope for this country, there's hope for security in this country, there's hope for stability in this country. And as somebody who has spent the last 10 years involved in this place, that was incredible news for me.Ira GlassHyder Akbar. He's the author of  the bookComeBacktoAfghanistan.This song that's playing right now is one that he swears was playing on his iPod when he was ambushed. And it's such a weird choice that it's hard to believe that he'd make that up. It's the Geto Boys' 1991 hit, "Mind Playing Tricks On Me."[MUSIC - "MIND PLAYING TRICKS ON ME" BY GETO BOYS]Act Two: Tucson, ArizonaIra GlassWell, if you live in a part of the country that has already had snow this year, you may find it hard to relate to the thrill experienced by some people in Arizona this past week. Lisa Pollak explains.Lisa PollakWhen I heard that an outdoor mall in Tuscon was promising snow on Saturday, a day when the high temperature hit 77 degrees, I figured there were only two possible explanations-- a pre-Christmas meteorological miracle or a ski resort style snow machine. But there was, in fact, a third option. I heard about it from Melanie Sutton, the senior marketing manager at La Encantada mall, the mall that sponsors the annual event known as the Enchanted Snowfall. She said that what we were about to see falling from sky that night was a desert style snow.Melanie SuttonAs our tagline, we say, "98% magic, 2% soap."Lisa PollakOh, wow. So it literally is, like, that's the ingredient, is soap? I mean, besides the magic.Melanie SuttonCorrect. The ingredient is soap. But they're shaped as snowflakes.Lisa PollakGot that? Me, neither. But minutes later, along with hundreds of parents and kids in the mall's open-air courtyard, I had a chance to see it for myself.Dad 1Oh, oh, here we go.Lisa Pollak"Oh, oh, here we go," I heard one of the dads say. Then there was a whooshing sound, followed by white stuff falling from the sky.Child 1It's snowing!Lisa PollakFrom a distance, I can report that it did indeed resemble snow-- heavy, white flakes lit up by spotlights in the darkness. Up close, though, it was hard to be fooled. Imagine little clumps of bath suds or globs of latte foam, with a faintly fresh smell.Dad 2There it is, look!Lisa PollakThis man is talking to his three-year-old son, Cameron, who at first seemed to be saying how much he liked the snow--CameronI don't like snow.Dad 2You like snow.Lisa Pollak--but on closer examination, was actually saying how much he didn't like the snow.CameronDon't like snow.Dad 2It's OK.CameronI don't like snow.Dad 2It's OK.Lisa PollakCameron was the exception. All around me, kids seemed to be going insane with joy. Over by the Apple store, a group of them had planted themselves under one of the faux snow machines and seemed to be trying to get as much white foam on their hair and clothes as possible. Others ran around with outstretched hands, trying to catch enough to make mushy snowballs and smash it on each other's heads.[CHILD LAUGHING]Child 2My hair!Lisa PollakOne boy walked up to me with a mass of suds in each hand and a look on his face like he couldn't believe his good fortune.Boy 1Look at how much snow I have.Lisa PollakSuddenly I felt a sense of duty. Shouldn't these kids know the truth? I would break it to them gently.Lisa PollakIt looks kind of like soap.Boy 1That's because it is soap. It's kind of like regular snow. But if it gets in your eyes, your eyes just terribly burn. It's just bubbles, but I can't believe it! I've never seen this happen before!Child 3So fun! And it's soap!Boy 2I tasted it. It tastes like soap.Lisa PollakAbout halfway through the show, I noticed I was starting to cough. And I wasn't the only one. I overheard this lady talking to her husband. Everyone's coughing, she said.Man 4We're all going to get cancer.Lisa PollakWhat did you say?Man 4We're all going to get cancer.Lisa PollakWhy did you say-- [COUGHS]Man 4Just listen. Everybody's standing here coughing, right? So it can't be good for you.Lisa Pollak[COUGHS]Man 4Yeah. Right? There you go. There you go. Get you some.Lisa PollakI checked with Melanie, the mall's marketing manager. She assured me that whatever was in the bubbles had been tested and was nontoxic. Though I believed her, I was a little relieved when the Enchanted Snowfall powered down after 15 minutes. Like a lot of things about the holidays, it was at its best from a distance, and a little went a long way.Ira GlassLisa Pollak. Coming up, a guy walks into a bar-- usually not a life-or-death situation. That's in a minute from Chicago Public Radio and Public Radio International when our program continues.Act Three: Washington, D.C.Ira GlassIt'sThisAmericanLife.I'm Ira Glass. This week, instead of the usual sort of theme we do on our show, our theme is just the seven days that have just passed. We have stories, small and personal, and big and national, and international.Monday, you probably heard, House Speaker John Boehner issued his counterproposal to avoid the fiscal cliff. It was promptly rejected by the White House. By Wednesday, there were front-page stories that Republican leaders are considering a fallback plan to extend tax cuts to the middle class now, fight about the rest of it in January or February.Also this week, Boehner cracked the whip in his own party. Republicans who didn't vote his way lost committee assignments. He warned to other House members that he would be watching. To put all of this in perspective, I called veteran Congress-watcher Norman Ornstein, who happened to be in Prague when I phoned him. His official title is Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.Norman OrnsteinBut all I care about is that you mention the book--Ira GlassAnd the title of the book is?Norman Ornstein--which is,It'sEvenWorseThanItLooks--HowtheAmericanConstitutionalSystemCollidedwiththeNewPoliticsofExtremism.Ira GlassConsider it mentioned.Norman OrnsteinOK.Ira GlassSo you're in Prague this week. Isn't this kind of a big week not to be near Capitol Hill for somebody like you?Norman OrnsteinIt's a good week to be away from Capitol Hill in a lot of ways.Ira GlassHow so?Norman OrnsteinWell, it seems like a big week. But the fact is we're in the middle of an end game. And I've been kind of bemused by all of the focus on the every-minute maneuvering of Speaker John Boehner and President Obama, including a heavy focus on the fact that Boehner didn't pose for a picture with the President at the White House Christmas party.And there's one important principle to keep in mind. When does an end game end? At the end. And the end is not this week.Ira GlassAre you basically saying that this is a week we might as well ignore the news from Capitol Hill?Norman OrnsteinYes. I'm saying that there are naturally going to be people who follow every little twist and turn. But it doesn't really matter.Ira GlassSo this is the thing that I was wondering, is, when you look at this maneuvering, can you tell how it's going to play out?Norman OrnsteinThe answer is two-fold. The first part is, no, you can't tell how it's going to play out. But all of these ploys and, in some ways, histrionics are par for the course. So taking the temperature on any one of them doesn't really tell us that much.Now, what I would have to say, though, is the second point. And it's frankly a giant caveat here. We are going through the most dysfunctional politics I've seen in 43 years. So I think there's a pretty good chance we'll get a patchwork deal to get us past this dilemma before the end of the year.But I also think that there's a substantial chance, much higher than it would have been if we were looking at the process 20 years ago or 10 years ago, even 5 years ago, that we'll slip over into January. And it might take a jolt, a serious jolt, from the markets to bring us to some kind of conclusion here.Ira GlassNorman Ornstein. I asked him, why do they even bother going through the theater this week? Why not just skip to the part where they actually hammer out the deal? His answer, I thought, was interesting.He said that the Republicans need to demonstrate to Grover Norquist and Rush Limbaugh and all their own constituents that they tried everything, their back is against the wall, there was no other choice before they can raise taxes. The Democrats have their own version of it. They have to demonstrate to their base they had no choice but to cut entitlements before any deal. Both sides need to say no, he says, for a while.Act Four: New Orleans, LAIra GlassWednesday night, New Orleans, French Quarter. A 25-year-old blonde girl named Joni Cooper is going up to everybody in this bar, asking a question that you probably wouldn't expect to hear on a night out drinking.Joni CooperHey, guys.Bar Patron 1How are you?Joni CooperCan I come chat with you?Bar Patron 1Sure.Joni CooperWell, my name's Joni. And I'm here with NO/AIDS. We're doing free HIV testing today. Would y'all maybe be interested in getting tested tonight?Ira GlassNO/AIDS is an organization in Louisiana that works to prevent and reduce the spread of HIV and help treat people who are infected. Louisiana has the fourth highest estimated AIDS rate in the country. In 2011, nearly 60% of new HIV diagnoses in Louisiana were gay man. 74% were African Americans. So NO/AIDS tries to make finding at your HIV status as convenient as they possibly can, which means, for them, going into bars, asking people to put down their drink for 15 minutes, and come get tested. They get the results on the spot.Bar Patron 2It's my birthday, so--Joni Cooper[SCREAMS]. Happy birthday!Ira GlassJoni is pitching a group of guys who are out for their friend's 30th birthday. You might think this would not be a receptive crowd, but listen to what happens.Bar Patron 2You're doing it right now? Like, what time?Joni CooperWe're doing it right now.Bar Patron 2Let's do it.Joni CooperYou want to go?Bar Patron 2Let's go.Joni CooperAll right!Bar Patron 2Let's go. I'm going to get tested. You coming?Bar Patron 3Where?Bar Patron 2Right here, right now.Robin PearceYou catch someone by surprise. You kind of catch someone off guard, and they're like, oh, well, I guess it's here. I've never done it.Ira GlassRobin Pearce runs the testing program, which has testing sites all over New Orleans, not just in bars.Robin PearceThe statistic is that 1.2 million people in the United States are living with HIV, and one in five of them don't know they have it. So finding the people who don't know that they have HIV is the point of what we're doing.Ira GlassThe week that we're covering here today happened to begin with World AIDS Day. And thinking about that, we sent out a writer, Nathaniel Rich, to watch the HIV testing at one of the highest risk venues NO/AIDS tests at-- Club New Orleans, a five-story sex club for men in the center of the French Quarter, which means that this story might not be appropriate for all children or maybe any of them. It acknowledges the existence of sex. Here's Nathaniel. We changed the name of the guy he's writing about in this story.Nathaniel RichRoom 300 was the largest bedroom in the club, just large enough to fit a chair and a queen size bed covered with red satin sheets. Sitting cross-legged on the bed was Alex Lee, a 25-year-old counselor for NO/AIDS, who's also a student at the University of New Orleans. He's majoring in anthropology. In fact, he had a final exam the next morning.When Mark entered the room, Alex was reading an essay about Occam's razor. Alex asked Mark to sit in the chair. He explained that the HIV test would only detect an infection that occurred more than three months ago. He showed Mark how to use an applicator to swab this mouth-- first his upper gums, then his lower gums. When Mark was finished, he dipped the end of the applicator into a small vial.Alex set a timer to 20 minutes, the time it takes for a test result to appear, and placed it on the bedside table between them. He asked Mark a series of questions. "When was your last test?" "About a year ago," said Mark, "at a bar, in fact.""In the past 12 months," asked Alex, "have you had anal sex with a man?" "Yes," said Mark. "Have you had sex without using a condom?" "As a giver," said Mark. "How about sex with an anonymous, casual, or internet partner, someone you didn't know too well?" "I'm sure I have," said Mark.He seemed to become increasingly anxious. He crossed his arms, holding his elbows, hugging his chest. "Have you knowingly had sex with someone who's living with HIV?" "No." "Have you injected any drugs?" "No.""Have you had sex with someone who injects drugs?" Mark paused for two seconds. "No," he said. Alex started the next question, but Mark interrupted him. "Yes," he said, "yes, I have." "Sex with someone who injects drugs?" "Yeah. I just didn't know it until after."The timer beeped. "Does that mean it's ready?" asked Mark. "No," said Alex. "It just beeps sometimes.""It's so funny," said Mark, "and this is so crude, but I did have intercourse last night, not wearing a condom. It's just weird. The guy told me he was negative, but for some reason, after all was said and done, I thought he was really positive. And then I was thinking on the walk home how stupid that was."Mark had been busy all day at work, so it had been easy to avoid thinking about it. But that evening, he went for a walk and soon found himself standing in front of the club. It was odd, Mark said, because he hadn't visited the club for a year. As soon as he stepped inside, a voice came on the loudspeaker announcing that there would be free HIV testing that evening. Suddenly, Mark understood why he had come to the club, and he felt scared.There were five minutes left on the timer. "I'm really anxious," said Mark. He looked it. He was jittery. He rose from his chair. He said he was going to walk around and come back when his result was ready.But five minutes later, when the timer went off, Mark was gone. Alex waited another 10 minutes, then another 10. A different man was tested, waited for his result, then left. Still no sign of Mark.Alex was mystified. In his two years testing men at bars, nobody had ever fled before finding out his results. It was now almost 11:30. His shift had official ended half an hour ago, and his anthropology final was at 10:00 AM.As Alex gathered his testing materials, his colleague, Brandon, decided to make one final effort to find Mark. Brandon started in the gym. Mark wasn't there. Nor was Mark in the sauna or the whirlpool.He was not in the room called the Bookstore, which doesn't have any books, nor was he in the Barracks. He was not in the so-called Porno Room, in which every surface is made of black rubber. And he was not in the Dungeon.Brandon paced through the narrow hallways, which are lined with more than 50 tiny bedrooms. Some of the doors were ajar. He saw harnesses and swings. He saw men watching videos.And then, in another bedroom, Brandon saw Mark. He was sitting on a bed, talking with a naked man. "Oh," said Mark, "are you looking for me?"Five minutes later, Mark returned to room 300. His fingers were trembling. He was too nervous to sit. Alex told him that his test had come back negative."Yay!" Mark shouted. He was ecstatic. He asked Alex to show him the result on the test form. "God, I'm so happy. Thank you. Oh my god."He thanked Alex a few more times and said he was grateful for the work that NO/AIIDS was doing. Mark even said he wanted to volunteer for the organization, that he felt, as a member of the New Orleans gay community, it was the right thing to do.

Except for the Geto Boys, all the songs between stories today was a release or on albums that were released in the last seven days.Act Five: Cairo, EgyptIra GlassA week can be a long time, when every day seems to shift the direction of your entire country. Egypt has had a week of demonstrations, counter demonstrations, and violence. The demonstrations are for and against the country's president, Mohammed Morsi.And OK, quick review-- Morsi was democratically elected a couple months ago. But at the end of November, he shocked many Egyptians by issuing a decree giving himself enormous powers, basically putting all his decisions, past and present, above the law. He said he had to do this because judges appointed by Egypt's ousted dictator, Hosni Mubarak, were undermining him. Some of those judges had dissolved Egypt's newly elected parliament right before Morsi took office.So now, if you follow the news at all, you've seen this-- both sides are dug in, each convinced that they represent true democracy in Egypt. There are a lot of ways for things to get worse, very few for them to get better. Nancy Updike reports on what has happened and how some of the anger is being spread around.Nancy UpdikeUp until this past Wednesday, opponents and supporters of President Morsi had held their rallies in different places-- on purpose, to avoid confrontations. But late in the day on Wednesday, supporters of President Morsi, members of the Muslim Brotherhood, marched to the presidential palace, where some anti-Morsi protesters were camped out. And after that, all night long, people fought or ran or hid.By Thursday morning, seven people were dead, and hundreds were injured. And four of Morsi's advisers had resigned in protest. As of right now, Friday evening, around 6:00 PM Egypt time, the leaders of both sides aren't talking to each other, and protesters are still in the streets, separate and peaceful for the moment.When I was in Cairo after Mubarak was ousted last year, I saw a scene that now seems impossible-- writers and editors, secular Egyptians, who were talking over croissants with members of a formerly violent Islamist group named Gamaa Islamiya, an ally of the Muslim Brotherhood. The secular men and the devout men weren't becoming friends. But they weren't beating each other up in the streets, either.[PHONE RINGING]Yusuf Al-qaidHello?Interpreter[SPEAKING ARABIC].Nancy UpdikeOn Thursday night, I made a phone call through an interpreter. She was shouting a bit to make herself heard. And we called one of the people from that meeting, an Egyptian novelist in his 70s named Yusuf al-Qaid to find out his take on the week's events. He remembered me, but he wanted to make absolutely sure I knew where he stands in this fight.Yusuf Al-qaid[SPEAKING ARABIC].TranslatorI would like our American journalist here to understand that I am not in any neutral position here. I am with a civilian modern state. I am against a religious state. I am against any rule based on religion.Nancy UpdikeSo against Morsi. And since he brought up the fact that I'm American, I told al-Qaid that I'd seen pictures of anti-Morsi protesters, people like him, carrying signs talking about the US and President Obama. I didn't mention this specific one to him, but I saw a sign that said, "Obama, your bitch is our dictator." The vehemence of al-Qaid's response caught me by surprise.TranslatorIn my view, the biggest betrayal that has taken place against the Egyptian people is the absolute support that the American administration has given to the Muslim Brotherhood. America is ignoring the violence that is conducted against the Egyptian people. America is completely silent and has voiced that its relationship with Egypt is strategic. And therefore, passing events do not affect this strategic relationship.Nancy UpdikeBy strategic relationship, he means that the United States is more concerned about Egypt's dealings with Israel than about Egypt's dealings with its own citizens. This week, more than ever, I realized that no matter how angry and caught up in their own national issues a person is, depending on what country they're in, they probably still have plenty of anger left over for the United States.After I hung up with al-Qaid, I called another person I met in Cairo last year-- completely different guy, a religious man, young, 28 years old, named Mohammed Agiba. Mohammed spent years in the Muslim Brotherhood. But now he's marching against Morsi too. He knew Morsi's power grab would divide the country. And he thinks the proposed constitution is a disaster that has to be stopped.And talking about the constitution is when we ended up at the same place I ended up with al-Qaid, the secular guy. Mohammed talked about how the constitution calls for a joint civilian military council, weighted toward the military, that has to be consulted before the president can declare a war. The council also has a role in deciding on the military's budget. Mohammed sees the council as one thing only.Mohammed Agiba[SPEAKING ARABIC].TranslatorThis is what the US wants; this is what Israel wants-- a regime which appears to be democratic to the people, but actually it is this defense national council which will be doing all the work. This council, the National Defense Council, will be the one ruling the country.Nancy UpdikeSo are you saying you think President Morsi or part of his government or all of his government are puppets of the United States?Mohammed Agiba[SPEAKING ARABIC].TranslatorFor sure President Morsi wants the interests of Egypt. However, he sees the implementation of this interest, or finding the interest, from a very narrow perspective that the United States has set for him. We do not want him to see that perspective through the United States' perspective.We want him to see it through the Egyptian people's vision and through the Egyptian people's perspective. And we say, please, the Egyptian people should be your priority and not the American administration.Nancy UpdikeI asked Mohammed one more question, not about America, but about Egypt and the choices people have faced there since the revolution. I asked him if he'd voted for Morsi. He did, like a lot of people who are now protesting against Morsi.He said he doesn't regret it. The alternative was worse. He says he just hopes Morsi can pull out of this and pull Egypt out too.Ira GlassNancy Updike.
