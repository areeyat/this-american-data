I'm strolling past the swine barn, and the kids' talent show stage, and the lemonade shake up stands, and the many, many corn dog stands, and the Central Iowa Railroad Club Exhibit building, and the chainsaw art, and the live snakes, and the vast, slowly moving rivers of people.Every one of those million is here on their own personal quest for what they want out of the fair. Stuff they want to do, stuff they want to see, everybody has their own mission. Declan and Killian, for instance, seven and nine years old, brothers from a suburb of Des Moines. They want to see the giant bull. Killian, the big brother, talked to my co-worker, Diane Wu.Diane WuWhy are you so excited to see the bull?KillianIt's one of my favorite animals.Diane WuHow come?KillianThey can see red, and red is my favorite color.DeclanWhat? You said it was black every day.Ira GlassHis little brother Declan with a fact check about Killian's favorite color being black. Another fact check-- bulls can't actually see red. The boys wander around the outside of the cattle barn, looking for the right entrance.KillianSuper sized bull.Diane WuOh, I wonder if--KillianThat way.Diane WuYep.Ira GlassThe bull's name is Teddy Bear, and it weighs 3,060 pounds. Signs duct taped onto the pen say, do not touch the bull, which is, like, yeah.Diane WuWhat do you think?KillianThat's cool. And big. I thought it would be smaller.Diane WuYou thought it would be smaller.KillianA little bit.Ira GlassWhen you see a giant animal, if you're a kid or an adult, what is there to say other than, yeah, OK. That's about right. Elsewhere--[GUNSHOTS]Adam RossCowboy-mounted shooting is one of the fastest growing equestrian sports in the country. It's a timed event where we use two 45 single-action long Colt pistols.Ira GlassIn the cowboy-mounted shooting competition, each competitor is on horseback. And they ride a course, shooting burning embers from their guns. They try to pop five balloons with one pistol. Then they change guns, shoot five more balloons with the other pistol, then gallop to the finish line, all without stopping.Adam RossSome of these runs we're going to be doing today are going to be nine seconds, because that's less than a second per shot with a gun change. It's a lot happening all at once.Ira GlassAdam Ross is actually ranked sixth in the world at this sport, but somehow, he has never won first place here in his home state of Iowa. That's his mission for this year's fair, he told my co-worker, Ike Sriskandarajah.Adam RossI'm naturally competitive. When everybody else puts their horses away in the winter, me and my wife take our horses to the barn and we ride all winter long. We try to outwork every one of our competitors.Ike SriskandarajahAnd when you survey this room of competitive riders in your level, who's the one you're most keeping an eye on?Adam RossI look right in the mirror at myself. I know that I'm the fastest one here. I have the horse that's the most proven here this year. So as long as I don't beat myself when I go out there and run my match, I know that there's nobody that will compete with me.[CHATTER][CHOIR MUSIC]Group(SINGING) God will be with you until we meet againHe blows better floating o'er youIra GlassA slightly slower pace over at the replica of Iowa's first church. The original was built in 1834. It's a cozy log cabin, where the goal is to reflect on God's goodness right in the middle of a gigantic, noisy carnival. They hold services twice a day during the fair, where Iowans are not officially permitted to pray, but they are, the guy leading the service says, allowed have to sing prayers.Group[VOCALIZING]ManThank you.[APPLAUSE]Ira GlassHigh above nearly everything at this fair, looking down on everyone, stands Byaunda, age 11, on the giant slide for her very first time. It is a massive metal slide that you fly down on a felt mat. And she has a simple goal of her own.ByaundaSo we're going to go on the slide. And I'm very terrified right now because one wrong move, and I'm done.Ira GlassAnd then she and her sister, Asele, grab their mats and push off.[SCREAMING]ByaundaOh my god.[LAUGHTER]Ira GlassThe Varied Industries building is an enjoyable mishmash of t-shirts and household stuff for sale, but also expensive devices to help your blood circulation or your horse's blood circulation, plus, a guy in one of the more surprising missions at the fair, I thought.Marty GoldenNow, this is--Ira GlassMarty Golden, in a neatly pressed blue uniform and Navy hat, was standing in front of a booth promoting theUSSIowabattleship, a World War II-era ship that's now a floating museum, its restoration paid for in part by grants from the state of Iowa.Marty GoldenWe want to make the citizens of Iowa more aware of the battleshipIowaand let them know that anybody that's a resident of the state of Iowa gets on board theIowabattleship for free. And if they let us know they're from Iowa, we'll take them behind the scenes to places that are not opened up to the general public.Ira GlassBut there's a catch. Iowa happens to be landlocked. The ship is docked in Los Angeles, hence Marty's mission to get Iowans out there. Marty did two years in the Navy, 30 years in the Reserves. He served on a ship right off the coast of Havana during the Cuban Missile Crisis. He's also a marine biologist who studied ocean life, retired now. But he loved the Navy enough that now, he's a tour guide on theIowa,which, again, is in the Port of Los Angeles. Marty is not an Iowan. He lives out there.Marty GoldenI miss the Navy so much that I volunteer now about once a week down on the battleshipIowa.Ira GlassAnd they flew you out here?[CHATTER]Marty GoldenMore or less.Ira GlassOh, you flew yourself out here.Marty GoldenI contributed a substantial amount of the effort to get out here.Ira GlassSo basically, you said, let me go and do this. It'll be fun. And they're like, great.Marty GoldenYeah, they probably would have covered all of my expenses, but I believe in the ship. And the ship is always struggling to bring money in to keep operating.Ira GlassSo you didn't want to take any money away that could have gone to the battleship?Marty GoldenCorrect.Ira GlassThe Iowa State Fair began in 1854, just eight years after Iowa became a state. They hadn't even picked a location to build their State Capitol building yet, but they wanted to come together for a fair, for reasons that aren't that different from why we do it today. And what are they?I think at a state fair, so much of what's on exhibit is us. We come, with the animals we raised, and our pies and sewing projects, our spelling bee skills, and our expertise at shooting balloons from horseback, and our love for a Navy museum battleship that we think others would love also if we could just tell them about it in person.We take in the exhibits and we are the exhibits at a state fair. That's what's so different about a state fair from everything else. Today, we hang out with some of the one million people at the fair and see if they get what they wanted and dreamed of from the fair this year. From WBEZ Chicago,ThisAmericanLife.I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.Act One: Carny ConfidentialIra GlassThis AmericanLife,Act One, Carney Confidential. So Bailey Leavitt has a different relationship to state fairs and carnivals from most of us.Bailey LeavittIt always feels good to be back on a midway. When I come out here, I smell it. It just feels like home to me.Ira GlassBailey grew up in carnivals, comes from a family of carnies.Ira GlassWait, I'm smelling. What is the smell you're talking about?[CHATTER]Bailey LeavittSo I smell turkey legs, for sure. I could smell the cotton candy, that burnt sugar smell. And there's always an underlying kind of grease smell, the diesel smell from the rides and from the generator, which is giving power to all the rides. It's so comforting to me.Ira GlassBailey read on Instagram that we were going to be doing this show about state fairs and she wrote in, talking about her family's life on the road as carnies, mostly out west. I thought it would be fun to walk through the midway with her and see it through her eyes, because she notices all kinds of stuff, big and little, that you and I don't know enough to notice. She grew up with a different vocabulary for everything around us here. She calls all the games joints.Bailey LeavittWell, it's a four-sided joint, but then three sides--Ira GlassCotton candy stands are poppers. Food stands are grabs. Prizes are flash. Carnivals themselves are shows, as in--Bailey LeavittHe's actually still on that show. And I think he's managing rides now.Ira Glass--a bunch of different shows. 13 independent companies provide the games and rides for the Iowa State Fair. We walk up to a balloon game that must be, I don't know, 20, 25 feet tall, a structure made from aluminum scaffolding with flags and prizes hanging everywhere, and two giant banners saying, bust one wins. Bailey gives it a once over. She's impressed.Bailey LeavittYou can tell that they take good care of the joint because you see how clean all this stuff is, where all those connection points are?Ira GlassYou're pointing to the frame of the stand itself.Bailey LeavittYeah, the joints where different pieces link up for this game. All that stuff is really well maintained.Ira GlassBailey tries to spot who's green help and who's a 40 miler-- that means just there for a bit-- and who's a genuine carny. Before I met Bailey, I honestly wasn't so sure if people still use the word carny or if it has some sort of derogatory, old-timey feeling to it. She told me some carnies hate the word, but she and her family embrace it with pride. These days, Bailey works for a little software company that her mom started.Two of Bailey's brothers and her sister are still on the show, and her dad and stepmother were in a show in Alaska that her dad tries to pull her back into now and then. Bailey has happy memories growing up, running around carnivals and state fairs. She could ride any ride or play any game for free, surrounded by adults, her parents' employees, who kept their eyes on her. There were incredibly special days, like stock day, when the stuffed animals for the fair, the stock, would arrive on a giant semi-trailer truck.Bailey LeavittAnd it was a giant pile of toys that I could literally jump in and swim in like a ball pit, but with stuffed animals. That was my favorite.Ira GlassBailey started to work in the fair for real when she was 10, working a goldfish game.Bailey LeavittA four-sided center joint.Ira GlassBailey's mom, Tyna, joined us for a while in the midway. She was watching Bailey's baby while Bailey and I walked around. Tyna co-managed the family carnival for years and jokes that her kids learned to count by counting money. Says Bailey was great at drawing a crowd, loved the attention, loved performing. When she was little, her flaw as an employee? She did not care about convincing people to spend more money on the game.TynaShe would sit there and talk to people. And sometimes, she would get in trouble because, if she's talking to people, she's not actually making money. She's just talking to people. But then as she got older, she focused a little bit better, but--Bailey LeavittWeird that your child labor didn't pay off like you thought it would.TynaChild labor laws do not apply to family, and they learn that very young.Bailey LeavittYes. [LAUGHS]Ira GlassIs that true?TynaIt is true. At least, that's what I told them. And they believed me.Ira GlassMom was actually right about that one. Something you don't think about too deeply as a civilian fairgoer, looking for fun, is that for the people working the fair, it really is all about money, how much you can make and how quickly and efficiently you can bring it in. Among other things, a state fair is a collection of small businesses attracted by the massive crowds. And among the people like Bailey, who work games and rides, the workers who make the most money are called agents.The word "agent" means different things in different regions of the country among carnies. But where Bailey was a carny, agents were just the best there was, so good at getting families and guys trying to impress their girlfriends to throw money at games that carnival owners would pay them more than anybody else, and they would jump from show to show. They're agents, as in free agents. As we walk through the fairgrounds, the thing that Bailey wanted to show me more than anything was an agent.Bailey LeavittYeah, so an agent is someone who can do what we call putting a mark to sleep, where they're going to be able to kind of put you in this state where alls you want to do is continue playing their game. You want to work towards whatever prize they have you working towards, whether it's popping balloons, or knocking over milk bottles, or whatever. You're going to spend way more money than you planned on at that game. And whenever you get somebody in that state, if you're able to do it really well, it's called putting a mark to sleep.Ira GlassBailey and her stepdad once watched an agent who put a mark to sleep so well that he spent all of his money, left the game, and then came back with more money.Bailey LeavittI'm getting chills as I talk about it. I've never seen anybody do that. Once a mark leaves your game, usually, they're awake and it's done.Ira GlassI wanted to see this. I wanted to see an operator who put somebody to sleep. So we headed out in search of an agent.Bailey LeavittThere's going to be a lot of agents here.Barker 1Come on up and come on in, guys. Who else wants to have some water gun fun today?Ira GlassWe head over to a game where there's a row of 14 chairs in front of 14 targets. The way this game works is you sit and fire a water pistol at the target. When you hit the bullseye, the water goes into a tube, filling it up. First player to fill their tube wins a stuffed doll.Barker 1All right.[CHATTER]We got number one.Ira GlassThese long pauses you're hearing, Bailey disapproves.Barker 1All right.Ira GlassThis guy's trying to get people to sit and play the game. Three players sit, then a fourth. 10 seats are empty.Barker 1Last call for this race. At the sound of the bell, the water will start. Everybody ready in 3, 2, 1. Here we go. Go, go, go. All the way to the top. Keep your eye on this dot. Don't look up. It's water racing and water chasing today. Number eight, winner, winner, winner!Ira GlassSo what do you think of him?Bailey LeavittHe's OK. He's not the best I've seen, but he's not the worst.Bailey LeavittHe's doing good at trying to engage people and make them play, but he's had a lot of pauses where he's not talking at all.Ira GlassBailey knows this particular game well, the water race. She's been the one on the mic running the water race for her dad's carnival in Alaska.Barker 11 and 2.Ira GlassShe was taught to do lots of rhyming when you're on the mic, lots of alliteration, like watch them race them, watch them chase them. That's one she did. This guy does not do much of that. Also--Bailey LeavittHe's only getting three to four players each time.Ira GlassDo you think he can be pulling in more people?Bailey LeavittAbsolutely, yeah. It's a nice game. It has great stock. The joint looks really nice, really clean. But they could be making a lot more money, in my opinion.Ira GlassDo you think this guy is an agent?Bailey LeavittNo, definitely not.Ira GlassWe cross the fairgrounds, find another water race game, and this one's huge and beautiful, 26 seats instead of 14 like the first one. It's what Bailey calls a double-sided joint. There are two rows of chairs facing each other, and the guy on the mic stands in the middle on a platform between the two rows. Huge, fluffy prizes hanging everywhere. And the guy on the mic--Jeremy BuvierGet ready, get set, go, go, go, go. All right, don't waste the drippity drop trying to get to the tippity top. Stop, watch, and see. Who's it going to be? And the winner is--Bailey LeavittRight there, all that rhyming, the alliteration.Ira GlassAlliteration.Bailey LeavittYeah.Jeremy BuvierNumber 18, winner, winner, winner.Bailey LeavittHe's constantly talking. He's using a lot of alliteration, and rhyming, and catchy things to draw people in.Ira GlassEven I can tell, this guy's got charisma. He's a stocky, bald guy with a five o'clock shadow. When he's on the mic, you cannot look away.Jeremy BuvierYou guys ready?Ira GlassAnd that great, gruff, rock and roll voice.Jeremy BuvierGet ready, get set, go, go, go. Who's it going to be? Stop, watch, and see. Oh, man. It's close. It's neck to neck. It's toe to toe. Don't waste the drippity drop. Winner, winner, winner, winner, winner, winner, winner, winner, winner, winner, winner, chicken dinner.Bailey LeavittYeah, this setup is great. They've got really hyped up music, flashing lights. They also got their mic turned up, so his voice is a lot more clear than that other guy.Jeremy BuvierDidn't want to do that quick, huh? All right, let's see.Bailey LeavittAnd he's playing off his customers. He's joking around with them.Jeremy BuvierDo it again. All right.Bailey LeavittYeah, he's good at what he does.Jeremy BuvierLook it, brother.Ira GlassBailey's mom, former carnival manager, she's watching him, too.TynaHe's not a 40-miler. He's a carny.Jeremy BuvierCome on.Ira GlassI do get the guy to talk to me in little snatches of conversation while winners are picking their prizes. His name is Jeremy Buvier.Ira GlassHow long have you been doing this?Jeremy Buvier24 years.Ira GlassHow many months of the year do you work?Jeremy BuvierAll year.Barker 3Winner, winner, winner.Ira GlassYou work all year. Do you have a house or apartment somewhere that's yours?Jeremy BuvierI had an apartment up until January. I got tired of paying for it because I'm always gone. I'm buying a motor home in November.Ira GlassSo if you have a motor home, then you just take the motor home with you as you travel?Jeremy BuvierYep.Ira GlassWhat city was the apartment in?Jeremy BuvierLewiston, Maine. That's where I'm from.Ira GlassAnd who do you travel with?Jeremy BuvierI go-- I bounce around.Ira GlassBounce around. So this isn't-- you don't just travel with this ride?Jeremy BuvierNo.Ira GlassAnd you're staying in bunks here?Jeremy BuvierNo, I stay at hotels.Ira GlassSo you're doing good?Jeremy BuvierYes.Ira GlassWhat percentage are they paying you of the gross here?Jeremy BuvierI can't tell you that. It's good money, though.Ira GlassSo are you an agent?Jeremy BuvierPretty much. All right, I got to get back to work, though.Bailey LeavittHe's with it. He's an agent. You heard him talking about how he floats around and he just goes to different shows, he doesn't travel with any particular show-- that's all agent stuff. Staying in hotels-- agent. Agent all the way. Not talking about money-- agent. That's all agent moves.Ira GlassSo we saw an agent. But the truth is, we never got to see him really do his thing full force, because it was after 8:00 PM. This section of the fair, kiddieland, was dying down. So he never filled more than half the seats in his game. We didn't see him put anybody to sleep and keep them playing and spending money.But there was one more person Bailey and I watched. He was not, strictly speaking, a fellow carny. He was a salesman, a traveling salesman. But Bailey and I both watched him, mesmerized. And he was in one of the prime spots that anybody could possibly get at this state fair for selling anything.This was outside the Varied Industries building, next to the door, and also the corner of the building. So you saw him approaching from two different directions. The Iowa State Fair charges a bunch of extra money for that spot, of course. This guy was calmly making bank-- Kenny Burnell. He sells nozzles for garden hoses.Kenny BurnellWell, I have them in any color you want as long as it's green.Ira GlassSome agents, Bailey says, are high-energy, but some are the opposite. They win through calm. That's Kenny. And OK, just to describe his setup, he's standing next to a clear glass box that's maybe two feet by two feet by two feet, spraying water into it with a garden hose, whose nozzle Kenny twists clockwise or counterclockwise to make the spray bigger or smaller.Kenny BurnellGoing from left to right, you're going to have a little soft soak for potted plants. You've got a heavy rinse. You can get the house, the car, the windows. You got a wide fan. As you turn it, we'll go down to a pinpoint jet spray that'll clean the windows, the siding, and the gutters. And last but not least, you get a fine mist for delicate plants. That way--Bailey LeavittThis guy, he puts people to sleep. He's putting marks to sleep. That's what he's doing.[CHATTER]And he's good at it. Even his voice is kind of hypnotic, kind of getting them in the zone.Ira GlassWe stare at him as he puts people to sleep.Kenny BurnellAnd if you guys need a second one for the backyard, we do two for 75. You guys like to feel it as well.Customer 1We bought one, then we bought another. Now we're going to buy another.Kenny BurnellThank you. I appreciate that.Bailey LeavittHe's got a great visual presentation, but he's just really-- he has a really calm energy. And so you feel like this is a comforting guy, safe. So yeah, of course he's going to make the sale.Ira GlassWith every new group of customers, Kenny hits the product against the ground to show how durable it is. He makes the same jokes.Kenny BurnellAnd I have them in any color you want as long as it's green.Customer 2No purple?Kenny BurnellNo purple yet.Ira GlassWhen he gets a minute between customers to talk, Kenny Burnell tells me that his grandfather sold at state fairs, and his father. His own first memory of selling is doing a salsa maker demo at the Colorado State Fair one time with his dad when he was five and a half. He enjoyed it. When he was 10, he toured with his parents to state fairs and had his own booth, selling radio-controlled cars. As he got older, he learned to demo kitchen products.Kenny Burnell--and was pretty decent at it. But in my early teens, I was like, my heart's really not into kitchen gadgets, just not something I felt. And then I took a liking to this product. And I was like, I want to sell that.Ira GlassHe wanted to sell that because it has a great visual pitch. It's a quick pitch. Also, the water is loud. It's attention-getting. There's a wow moment when you hit the jet spray. And there's another wow moment when you go to the mist. And another advantage of these things? They're tiny.Kenny BurnellYou can fit a whole fair's worth of inventory on one pallet.Ira GlassA quick trade show-- he can check all the nozzles he needs into a carry on bag. Way better, he says, than when he sold pillows. It was 24 years ago when he started selling these. Some of his moves today, of course, he doesn't stop talking. Of course, he puts the product in the customer's hand. That's something he saw his dad do.He's learned that to talk for 12 hours straight for a week and a half for a state fair, to preserve his voice, he'll consciously pitch it a little higher or a little lower for stretches at a time. Here in the Midwest, and also in certain cities like Seattle, he said, he mostly does not make direct eye contact during the pitch. I noticed that.Kenny BurnellI was taught and raised to always make direct eye contact. What I found nowadays is I'll make eye contact roughly three times a demo. That's what I aim for-- one in the beginning, one in the middle, one right at the end when you're explaining the warranty and how much they are, but not too much, because I've done that a few times at this fair, where I'm making-- I'm demoing and doing it East Coast style. I'm making direct eye contact, and you can see them kind of looking off down the aisle. And they're just intimidated. And I don't want that. It's--Ira GlassIt's too aggressive to do the eye contact.Kenny BurnellIt's too aggressive, yeah.Ira GlassKenny, this is Bailey, who's worked a ton of fairs, a ton of carnivals.Bailey LeavittI grew up in the carnivals. So I just think you're great at what you do.Kenny BurnellThank you. I appreciate that.Bailey LeavittYeah.Ira GlassAnd then they got into a little chat about headset microphones. Bailey wanted to know why he didn't use one. Kenny was like, I usually do, but I had a problem with my mic and then a problem with my backup mic. Bailey was sympathetic. They liked each other. Game recognizes game. In my line of work, I have to say, putting somebody to sleep means you are not doing your job right. It's one of the worst things you can say to somebody.When I told Kenny that's what Bailey said about him, he laughed and decided to take it as the compliment it was. He ended up selling $33,000 worth of nozzles over the course of the fair. That's 877 nozzles in 11 days, or put another way, for 12 hours a day, every single day, Kenny sold an average of one hose nozzle every 10 minutes.Coming up, we go on a roller coaster of sorts, one filled with bunnies. That's in a minute from Chicago Public Radio when our program continues.ThisAmericanLife.I'm Ira Glass. Today's show, "Meet Me at the Fair," we hang out with some of the 1.2 million people who came to the Iowa State Fair this year to see if they got what they hoped for. And we'll get back to that in a second. But first, let me tell you a story. Back in 2013, the band Motley Crue was getting older. One of its founding members had gotten a degenerative disease. The drummer, Tommy Lee, was going around saying they wanted to stop doing shows before they had to start replacing bandmates.Tommy LeeThat's such a bad look, when bands are still playing the [BLEEP] fairgrounds.Ira GlassA year later, Tommy Lee said, we are not playing county fairs. But Wednesday night, at the Iowa State Fair this year, Motley Crue played. They rocked. Fans partied.FanLegalize cocaine! Hell yeah![SHOUTING][CHATTER]Dana ChivvisHow was the show?FanHuh?Dana ChivvisHow was the show?FanDude, I'm so [BLEEP] drunk, I can't [BLEEP] remember that [BLEEP].Ira GlassCurious about what it is like for the band to do this thing that they had sworn repeatedly they would never, ever do, we asked for an interview. The band said yes. And then a day later, we were told they would still love to talk to us, with one condition. They would not discuss playing state fairs.In other words, Motley Crue is chicken. So I just want to say to the band right now, our offer is still good. We actually do want to hear what this is like for you to do this. Reach out if you change your minds. And with that, we turn to Act Two of our show.Grandstand Chicken (Podcast Only)Ira GlassAct Two, How Bad is Your Bunny? So many people who come to the fair arrive with dreams tied to farmyard animals. There are non-stop animal competitions in hundreds of categories, all 11 days of the fair. One of our co-workers, Dana Chivvis, went to watch the 4H rabbit competition. She had no idea what an emotional roller coaster it would turn out to be. The 4H rabbit program is meant to teach kids lessons about animal science, and breeding, and caretaking, which they do learn, along with some other lessons. Here's Dana.Dana ChivvisThe rabbit show takes place in an industrial building on the outskirts of the fair-- tin roof, beige, metal siding, no frills. Rabbits don't get the respect they deserve, except from the kids.Dana ChivvisHello.Molly FoxHi.Dana ChivvisI'm Dana. What's your name?Molly FoxI'm Molly Fox.Dana ChivvisMolly has shown rabbits at the county fair before, but this is her first year at the state fair, the big time. She's waiting in line to present the incredibly fuzzy black rabbit in her arms, a breed called Lionhead, named for the poof of mane it's supposed to have around its head. This competition is about presentation skills, demonstrating your knowledge about your animal's breed to a panel of three judges. Molly tells me she's not nervous. She carries her bunny to the judges' table.JudgeAll right, you may start whenever you are ready.Molly FoxHi. My name is Molly Fox, I'm 12 years old, and I'm from Hamilton County. This is Onyx. He is a junior buck Lionhead, and his color is black. First, I'm going to check the ears. Let me find the ear tattoo. There's so much fluff.Dana ChivvisMolly flips Onyx onto his back and opens his little rabbit mouth so his teeth show. So she's checking for buck teeth, pegged teeth.Molly FoxMalocclusion, wolf teeth, and broken or chipped teeth.Dana ChivvisThe goal here is for the kids to look for the things a veteran judge would look for if they were evaluating this rabbit. Molly runs through the checklist she memorized with her dad, ears, nose, teeth, and then wraps it up with this professional assessment.Molly FoxI would like to see more of the wool type of fur on his hind legs. But overall, he is a very-- he is an excellent rabbit.Dana ChivvisMolly has learned her 4H lessons well. The judges have no questions. She gets 94 points out of 100. Most of the kids I meet are proud of their rabbits. They talk about how soft they are, how nice their markings are, except for Jillian King, who is 11 and who has absolutely had it with her rabbit.Jillian KingBecause he's molting and he's really ugly right now. So I could get rid of him.Jillian's MomOh, babe.Jillian KingThat sounds bad, but it's true.Jillian's MomIt sounds awful.Jillian KingHe needs more hair. He doesn't match breed standards. He's just the best rabbit I had for this right now.Dana ChivvisThe rabbit in question is named Chacho. He's small and brown and has a bad case of bedhead, hair puffed out in all the wrong places, and a look that says he knows he screwed up.Dana ChivvisOh, he's so cute though.Jillian KingHe is cute, but not cute enough to be like that.Dana ChivvisWhat's his breed again?Jillian KingLionhead.Dana ChivvisOh, he's a Lionhead. I want to see the Lionheads.Jillian KingWell, there's better breed standards ones over here. He is not quite up to the best breed standard.Dana ChivvisSo you said.Jillian KingBut the better ones are over there.Dana ChivvisJillian takes me a few rows over and points to two bunnies. And holy hell, I am telling you, these bunnies are some good-ass-looking bunnies, with that kind of calm demeanor that comes with effortless beauty. One is brownish-gray with dark brown ears that stick up in a regal way and hair that seems feline. The other one has a classically pretty bunny face, light brown, chubby cheeks, button nose. He's sitting up like a dog-- or like a bunny, I guess-- his eyes locked on the back of Chacho's fuzzy head.Dana ChivvisWow.Jillian KingThese two are very up to breed standards. They are gorgeous. They have a perfect mane, and skirt, and saddle, and everything that you should see.If you compare--Dana ChivvisJillian holds Chacho up in front of these hot bunnies so I can see the difference.Jillian KingHe should have a lot more hair. His hair didn't grow out as well, but he's also molting. So he's losing a lot of it right now, but it'll grow back.Dana ChivvisHe's going through an awkward phase right now, though. Poor guy.Jillian KingBut he's still not as good as these guys. These guys would beat him in a regular show. They would just easily beat him. They're just better.Dana ChivvisAw.At the rabbit show, each rabbit is sized up against its breed standards. And then the judge awards the rabbit handler a ribbon. Confoundingly, purple is the best, followed by blue. A blue ribbon says your rabbit is up to breed standards, but isn't exceptional enough to get a purple. Next is red, which means your rabbit is a delinquent, and then white, which means you are a delinquent.Jillian and her older sister Jenna are both having a bad "hare" day. Get it? Chacho is a mess. And Jenna's best rabbit, Martini, just got disqualified. Jenna is sitting in a camping chair in tears.JennaI'm Jenna.Dana ChivvisCan I ask you what happened?JennaSo I breed Harlequin rabbits. I was told one of my rabbits is sick, that her nose is running. And she's the best coloring I've got, and I don't know why she's sick. I'm just super disappointed right now.Dana ChivvisDisappointed and also worried. She loves this snotty rabbit. We walk over to Martini, who's lying across the back of her cage.JennaThat's Martini.Dana ChivvisShe's beautiful.JennaYeah.Dana ChivvisShe has black and white bands across her body, and a perfect face split, which is to say, half her muzzle is white and half is black, a very desirable trait in a Harlequin rabbit.Dana ChivvisShe's not happy.To my untrained eye, she seems pissed. Jenna says Martini and her sister, Tequila, don't really like people. She bred them herself, choosing to pair a rabbit named Whiskey with good coloring to a lady rabbit named Fawn, who has a great face split. Out of that blessed union, Martini was born.JennaIt was the week that things got really cold in January, like, negative 40. Half of her litter did not make it. It really sucked. But her mom got two of them through, which is good. So she's like a little miracle rabbit.Dana ChivvisWas that really sad?JennaYeah. It was my first litter, too. So that was a little bit rough, but you can't let it hold you back. You only get better the farther along you go. You can't really quit in the beginning.Dana ChivvisWell, I guess you could if you wanted, but--JennaYeah, but--Dana ChivvisJenna and I have a difference of opinion here. I'm totally for quitting, especially if the activity involves frozen bunnies. As we're admiring Martini, Jenna's mother, TJ, walks up with news.JennaShe doesn't-- she's what?TJShe's allergic to the sawdust. I just talked to that guy who said, hey, it's an allergy. They did--Dana ChivvisMartini is not sick. She does not have snuffles, which is rabbit sniffles. She's just allergic to the sawdust they put in all the rabbit cages at the fair. Jenna doesn't use sawdust at home, so she had no way of knowing this. She's crying again.JennaThat's so good to know.TJRight. I said, we're learning things the hard way this year, and that sucks.Dana ChivvisI suspect the lesson TJ is referring to is don't put sawdust in a rabbit cage. But I could see another lesson appearing on the horizon, one about the inevitability of disappointment, how disappointment leads to growth, how you don't need some technocrat from the bunny industrial complex to hand you a ribbon to know in your heart that you've got an outstanding rabbit.Dana ChivvisHow does that make you feel? Better?JennaYeah, way better. I really thought something might have happened and I didn't see it. I was kind of worried.TJAnd they invited us to the show in Boone in October because she's a phenomenal rabbit. [LAUGHS]JennaYay.TJCome here. Come here.Dana ChivvisThey hug it out.JennaI'm glad now that we know it's just an allergy. That makes me feel, again, 20 times better.TJDid you just hear what they said over the loudspeaker?JennaNo.TJFor Harlequins? The best rabbit here today had to be disqualified.Dana ChivvisUnderstanding washes over Jenna's face. More tears.TJDon't cry. I'm going to cry for you. You know what that means? You know what it means?JennaI don't want to show Martini again when she's not hay chip sick.TJYes. And that your breeding program is exactly on track where you want it to be. That is the moment you take away from this, that you did something phenomenal genetically. It's not about the show. I'm so proud. You be proud of that.JennaI need some Kleenex.TJI know. Me too. I don't have any. Don't cry.JennaThat's great. I'm excited to breed her now.Dana ChivvisJenna plans to match Martini with Mo, the rabbit in the cage next door, who's a few months younger than Martini and seems like a doofus. But I'm no expert.And what about poor Chacho, Jillian's discombobulated rabbit? He ends up getting a red ribbon, which is second to worst, or if you ask Chacho, third best. Jillian's surprised.Jillian KingIt was better than I was expecting.Dana ChivvisYeah, are you less mad at him now?Jillian KingNo, not really. I'm still getting rid of him. So he's cute, but he's not what I'm looking for to bring into my breeding program.Dana ChivvisThe lesson Chacho takes home from the State Fair is show business isn't for everyone, but he has a happy retirement to look forward to. Jillian plans to sell him to a good home, where he'll be someone's pet-- or maybe better for Chacho, the young buck in someone else's probably unsuccessful breeding program.Ira GlassDana Chivvis is a producer on our show. One quick program note before we go any further. Some of you may have noticed a word usage that you're getting ready to email us about. I just want to say right now, yes, we know that a hare is not the same thing as a rabbit. But can I say, puns breed around this office like punnies.Act Two: How Bad is Your Bunny?Ira GlassAct Three, Limp Biscuit. So every Iowan that I talked to outside the fair this year, when I mentioned that I was going to the fair, what we would end up talking about was food and what to eat. Food is a big thing at so many state fairs. News coverage of Iowa's fair always includes the latest stuff, like this year's bacon cheeseburger egg roll.There are nearly 200 food stands at the fair, and they rarely become available for people who want to try to create the next hit themselves. Those spots are highly coveted because there's so much money to be made. Fair's management says that some vendors earn their entire annual income for the year at those 11 days at the fair. Chris Benderev had followed one family that tried to jump into the game this year.Chris BenderevOf the handful of new food stands at the fair this year, it was obvious which one would be the most interesting to watch. It's run by a couple, Jamie and Jennifer Adkins. And as best as I can tell, they're different from the other food stand managers at the fair in one important way.Chris BenderevSo you guys have not run a restaurant before?Jennifer AdkinsThat's correct.Chris BenderevAnd you guys haven't run your own stand at another state fair before.Jennifer AdkinsCorrect. This is our first big gig.Chris BenderevAll the other new food stands in Iowa this year are owned and run by people in the restaurant business, or they've done other big fairs. So how did Jamie and Jennifer end up doing this? Well, for a long time, Jennifer had dreamt of opening her own coffee shop. Then her husband saw this opportunity, not to launch a coffee shop exactly, but to launch an 11-day-long state fair version of it.He heard about a food stand that was withdrawing from the state fair. They could save money by buying its used trailer and equipment. Jennifer could sell coffee drinks, and they'd do some food on the side-- biscuit sandwiches, they decided, because there aren't many vendors selling breakfast at the fair. And so they jumped in and prepared to launch Biscuit Bar. But when I talked to them in July, before the fair opened, they each had very different expectations for how much money they'd make.Jennifer AdkinsI tend to be more frugal and conservative about finances, so I'm really just hoping to be able to help pay for some of the expenses that we've had. That's really what I'm hoping for.Chris BenderevJennifer just wants to break even, cover all their costs, but she told me she didn't think they'd do that. The costs were too big. They'd spent $300,000 for the trailer and all the equipment. And that's before you get to salaries and food costs. Plus, the State Fair takes 19.5% of every dollar every food vendor brings in. Jamie, her husband, owns a successful trucking business. And when I reached him by phone, he was confident they'd make everything back this first year.Jamie AdkinsIt'll work. I guarantee that it'll work. No doubt about it. It'll work. It's just how much the profit is. My personal thought for this year was, I'd like to do about gross sales of $300,000, $350,000 on the minimum side. It's kind of like going to the casino. [LAUGHS] You go there to win. You just hope you win more than you lose.Chris BenderevThis kind of confidence, of course, is exactly what you'd need if you're an amateur and you decided you're going to get into any part of the restaurant business, a notoriously difficult business to make money in. But Jamie has a cousin, Joni, who runs two popular, very successful food stands at the fair. Jamie's helped her out a little in the past. And seeing his cousin's operation made the idea of raking in lots of cash seem way more possible, at least for him. Again, here's his wife, Jennifer.Jennifer AdkinsProbably for him, because it really looks effortless for her. She's just so good. And there's no way I'd ever be able to get up to her level. And I think for him, she really is inspiring, for sure. [LAUGHS]Chris BenderevCould that be almost a tricky thing because she makes it look deceptively simple?Jennifer AdkinsPossibly, yes.[CLATTER]6:30 AM, August 8, the first day of the fair. And this, employees scraping cooked food out of pots into storage containers, is the sound of a food stand about to debut itself to Iowa. The gates of the fair don't open until 8:00 AM, so let me give you a sense of the place. Right now, I'm in the open-air kitchen that's behind Biscuit Bar. This is where all the raw materials, meats and eggs and biscuits, are cooked, and then get passed into the trailer, where they're assembled into sandwiches. Everyone's calm. They're ready.Chris BenderevCan I ask what you guys are doing at this point?JeffCleaning tubs.Chris BenderevCleaning tubs.JeffAll our-- we got all our stuff made.Chris BenderevThe trailer Jamie and Jennifer paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for is gleaming, with a green and pink facade, emblazoned with real pictures of biscuit sandwiches, but also cartoons of friendly anthropomorphized biscuit sandwiches. The word "espresso" appears in four places. And then at the top, outlined with dots of neon lights in big letters, Biscuit Bar. There are three registers out front, each with a teenager behind it. Lily is the most chipper by far. She's ready to sell.LilyWe're really excited to be here. We've got a couple of great new items. We have the Piggy in a Donut, which won an award, especially for our piggy--Yes, our piggy secret sauce. It's kind of got a kick to it. It's got some chipotle in it. So if you're feeling something a little bit spicier, definitely, that's the way to go. We also have a Bubbly Latte, which is kind of like a hybrid between your--Chris BenderevIt's about 7:45 AM. Some of the people who are allowed in early, fair staff, people here to show livestock, they start lining up at Biscuit Bar, eager for breakfast and coffee. I find Jamie inside the trailer. He's got a buzzed head, goatee, gruff voice, but soft eyes. He's assembling coffee orders alongside one of his new employees.Jamie AdkinsWhat do you need?Customer 3Trying to get me some coffee.Staff 1A small iced espresso.Jamie AdkinsVanilla, and add whipped topping. So it's a small?Staff 1Yeah.Chris BenderevThey're both wearing these hot pink Biscuit Bar t-shirts. Everyone here is. And in this moment, I'm struck by how something as simple as matching t-shirts can create a unifying sense of shared fortune, of teamwork. It's almost beautiful to behold.Jamie AdkinsThe problem is that--Chris BenderevWait, actually, there's some kind of issue with the espresso drink.Jamie AdkinsSee, it looks weak to me.Staff 1That's what she was saying too.Jamie AdkinsWhat is going on here?Chris BenderevThis iced drink looks weird. It tastes weird. Jamie starts inspecting the back side of the large espresso machine.Staff 1See, I've always been intimidated by this thing.Jamie AdkinsSomebody shut this switch off. That's why.Staff 1Oh.Jamie AdkinsIt wasn't brewing because it's not hot. This is never supposed to get shut off, and somebody had shut it off.Staff 2And the two pigs are done.Jamie AdkinsIt's going to probably take five or six minutes. Let's just see.Chris BenderevWhen Jamie says it'll take five or six minutes for the water to reheat, he actually has no idea how long it'll take. A couple espresso drink orders are already waiting, and more are coming in. Five minutes pass. The water still isn't hot. Jamie shows Jennifer.Jamie AdkinsThe problem is that it's not hot, Jennifer. It's going to take five more minutes, probably.Jennifer AdkinsSo we need a vanilla iced espresso?Jamie AdkinsAnd there's fresh grounds in there ready to go, but the water isn't hot enough yet. So somebody shut the switch off on the bottom. I don't know what they was doing, but--Chris BenderevJamie leaves Jennifer to figure out the coffee. Meanwhile, the employees assembling the sandwiches inside the trailer are shouting out the window to the kitchen. They need supplies. Brisket for the brisket sandwich won't be ready for 20 more minutes. And there are other shortages.Staff 1We got sausage gravy?Staff 3Sausage gravy.Jamie AdkinsDo we have more gravy made?JeffNope.Jamie AdkinsOK, well, then we need to be making gravy. Wow.Chris BenderevOr a little later--Staff 1Can we get sausage patties, please?Jamie AdkinsWhat did she want?GrandmaSausage patties. Sausage patties.Jamie AdkinsWe better put some more on. Do you know where they're at?Chris BenderevJamie starts rummaging through the fridge, looking for more individually wrapped sausage patties. He started the day with just 80, and now they're almost out. Jamie does find a huge bag of raw sausage and gets people to start molding that into patties. His brother Jeff starts grilling them. Jamie feels like these handmade patties are a workable solution. Jeff, who is like a shorter version of Jamie with a dash of Joe Pesci mixed in, does not.Jamie AdkinsWe can make them right here.JeffYeah, them don't cook like the other ones do. They're a pain in the fucking dick.Chris BenderevIn case you didn't catch that, Jeff said the handmade patties are a pain in the fucking dick to cook.JeffBecause then you got to check every one of them because they're not the same thickness, not the same shape.Jamie AdkinsIt'll be all right.Chris BenderevJamie does have a secret card he can play in this situation. He phones up Joni, his cousin with the successful food stands, to see if she has extra patties.Jamie AdkinsHello? I think I'm going to run out of pork patties before I can get time to go to the kitchen and get what Josh dropped me. We are busy. We had a few people. Fucking Albert.Chris BenderevAlbert is the guy who was supposed to deliver the milk.Jamie AdkinsGive me that milk.Chris BenderevAnother problem.Jamie AdkinsMust not have brought me whole milk. I'm going to fucking kill him. Told him 12 gallon of whole milk, and he brought me all skim.Chris BenderevThis is a problem. You can't make gravy with skim milk.Jamie AdkinsMotherfucker. OK, bye.Chris BenderevMeanwhile, out in front of the trailer, there's a semicircle of customers waiting for their orders. They all seem pretty calm, including Erika and Kris, two women who are wearing athleisure wear.ErikaWe're waiting.Chris BenderevHas it been a bit of a wait?KrisJust a little bit, but that's OK. They're figuring things out.Chris BenderevCan I ask how long you've been waiting?KrisRight now, we're at eight minutes.Chris BenderevBack inside the big green and pink trailer--Staff 4Hey, we need another three piggies and a hot chick!Chris Benderev--it's very tight in the trailer. And to assemble sandwiches, people are constantly squeezing past each other because the sausage and biscuits and eggs are on one end, and the sauces and dressings and cheese are on the other. Then they drop the finished sandwiches, wrapped in foil, near the front window. But the problem is, there's nothing written on the foil. They all look alike, which is why one of the cashiers sticks his head in and asks me--Kitchen StaffWhat's this? Did you hear what this was?Chris BenderevNo, I have not.AlexIt's probably a regular.Kitchen StaffYeah, that was a regular.Chris BenderevOver and over, the staff have to gently unwrap the corner of a sandwich to check what it is. Of course, there's a simpler solution to this, a way to label the sandwiches. But--Jennifer AdkinsMarker. Where's the marker? Do you have a marker, Brooke?Chris BenderevJennifer, who's in charge of the trailer, cannot find the one permanent marker that they had. Oh, and also, some of the orders aren't showing up on the overhead computer screens inside the trailer. So everyone's resorted to just yelling out orders at each other.AlexI need a regular.Staff 5Regular.Staff 6We need a hot mess.Ben11-07!Staff 6Can we get a confirm on that hot mess?Staff 7Yes, you have to wait.Chris BenderevThings feel so out of control that just 45 minutes after the fair's gates have opened, Jamie calls for reinforcements, his 12-year-old daughter and his 19-year-old stepson, Alex.Jamie AdkinsHello? Where are you at? OK, you need to get to work. I know you're not supposed to start until 10:00, but we are slammed busy. Just get down here as quick as you can. There's people lined up clear to the street. And your mom probably needs you on the inside.Chris BenderevBack out front, I tracked down the customers, Erika and Kris, again. They'd just gotten their food.KrisIt's tasty. It's good, but not worth 35-minute wait.Chris Benderev35 minutes?KrisYes.Chris BenderevAnd what do you think?ErikaIt's very good. Yep. I wouldn't wait again.Chris BenderevThe whole thing's kind of painful to watch. People are requesting refunds. It's obvious this is not how this is supposed to go. I was curious how a food stand at the fair is supposed to work, and I didn't have to go far. A couple stands down is an incredibly successful food vendor that's been around for years.Matt RebarBrad and Harry's cheese curds have been at the Iowa State Fair since somewhere in the mid to early '90s.Chris BenderevMatt Rebar runs three cheese curd stands and one poutine stand here at the Iowa fair. And the way they operate has been refined over decades. And the biggest difference I noticed from Jamie and Jennifer's Biscuit Bar? Simplicity, all emanating from this fact.Matt RebarWe have one item. We have one item. It costs one amount. We know they're in line for cheese curds. We know what the change is. We can see in their wallet and know what bill they're going to grab, and we can already have the change ready by the time that transaction happens.Chris BenderevBiscuit Bar, by contrast, has 11 food items and 16 beverage choices, many with a bunch of different customizations.Matt RebarIt's volume. That's what we're after, is the volume. Quality, but volume.Chris BenderevInside his trailer, it's tightly packed with employees in a smaller space than Biscuit Bar. But somehow, it's more orderly.Matt RebarBut as far as workstations and positions in here, that's another thing. Everybody in there has one job, and they are within one foot of what they need to do. They don't have to take two steps to do anything in there.Chris BenderevReally?Matt RebarWe have enough people where, if you needed to take two steps, we're going to put another person in there to do that for you, just to be efficient as much as possible.Chris BenderevThe trailer was custom-built, so every step of making the food is laid out in perfectly sequential cheese curd assembly stations. Over at the Biscuit Bar, employees make complicated coffee drinks, smoothies, and pour fountain drinks. At Matt's cheese curd stands, his employees don't make drinks at all. Matt sees that as inefficient. Instead--Matt RebarWe've got a self-serve pop. Pop takes a lot of time, so if we can hand them a cup, they can go take their time, fill their ice as much as they want or as little as they want.Chris BenderevOne last note about the simplicity of Matt's cheese curd stands-- paper towels. People need them constantly in a kitchen, and Matt has positioned a roll that hangs horizontally from a bungee cord above the workers. They can grab and tear them off effortlessly without taking up any space. Meanwhile, back at Biscuit Bar--Jamie AdkinsThis stupid fucking thing.Chris Benderev--Jamie had one of those large, black, mechanized paper towel dispensers that you find in public restrooms, the kind you have to wave your hands under. This morning, it was spitting out only a couple inches of paper towel at a time. The whole first morning, it seemed like Biscuit Bar couldn't catch any luck. Then in the early afternoon--(SUBJECT) JENNIFER ADKINS: Are you guys ready to order?Jennifer AdkinsChris Benderev--it finally feels like Biscuit Bar rights the ship.Jennifer AdkinsA piggy? I'll get him a piggy.Chris BenderevEverybody's talking in a more normal volume, the wait times are way shorter, and the kitchen is feeding the sandwich makers what they need when they need it.Jamie AdkinsThere's you some more brisket.Chris BenderevThe lines are shorter now, not exactly 10 or 12 people deep, like during the breakfast rush, but there's still a steady flow of customers. People really like Biscuit Bar. I feel hopeful for them. For the first time, I think maybe they could break even. By the time I catch up with Jennifer again, it's closing time, 10:00 PM. She's at the cash register, is printing out the daily totals.Chris BenderevWhen you print out the totals from the registers, is that the first time you're seeing the numbers?Jennifer AdkinsYeah.Chris BenderevJennifer looks over the receipts, then tucks them away. Her face is hard to read, maybe a little solemn.Chris BenderevCan you tell me, looking at the receipts from the first day, do you have a sense of, oh, at this rate, if we do this for 10 days, we could break even or get close to my goal?Jennifer AdkinsNo. We just have so much money in this stand, and--Chris BenderevReally? Even with this big first day, it feels like--Jennifer AdkinsYeah.Chris BenderevJust then, Jamie wanders over.Jennifer AdkinsHe was asking if we were-- at this rate, if we would break even. [LAUGHS]Jamie AdkinsNo. We got a lot invested in the stand. And my guess, it's two years, three years.Chris Benderev10 days pass. The fair ends, and I check back in with Jamie and Jennifer. They'd both worked from 5:00 in the morning until 11:00 at night on their feet for 11 consecutive days without a break. It was grueling. And the money was way less than they'd hoped for, less than half of what Jamie had predicted. After the food costs and operating expenses, and after the fair took its nearly 20% cut, they were left with about $70,000 profit.$70,000-- good money, but all of it would go towards paying back their original investment, which was, remember, $300,000. At that rate, Jamie and Jennifer will be working for free for four years before they pay off their debts. And after four years, they take home $70,000 every state fair before taxes. A solid chunk of money, for sure. Lots of families would take that deal. But this was still so much less than they talked about earning. Remember, Jamie's estimate would have had them pocketing two or three times that amount.Chris BenderevSo I just wondered, does that math, how does that sit with you? Does that feel worth it to you?Jennifer AdkinsI think so. I mean, look, I'm not really bothered by it now, after the fact.Jamie AdkinsI think it's worth it. It's a lot of work, but it's worth it.Chris BenderevJamie told me he was completely unfazed when he saw the numbers come in.Chris BenderevYou didn't feel anything about, well, I guess we're going to be a little short of kind of half of what I wanted?Jamie AdkinsNo. No.Chris BenderevI think a lot of people would have a hard time adjusting to that reality, or less.Jamie AdkinsI wouldn't.Chris BenderevWait, really? I mean, you're a really blunt guy, Jamie. But on this one thing, I got to say, I don't know if I believe you.Jamie AdkinsYeah, no, you can believe me. I deal with it all the time. My trucking business, a couple of years ago, done right at $12 million in sales, gross sales. And we won't even be $8 million, probably, this year. I've been in business long enough that I know that just because you made that much money yesterday don't mean you're going to make it today.Chris BenderevI didn't appreciate at first just how much Jamie sees opening a business at the fair as being like a trip to the casino. When he predicted that they'd make $300,000 to $350,000 their first summer, that wasn't because he'd done some careful calculations, counting the number of biscuits you could sell each day.It was just a wish. He was going to put his money down on the table, roll the dice, and hope for the best. And even though it'll take years before they pay off Biscuit Bar's debts, Jamie is already encouraging Jennifer to open up her coffee shop this upcoming spring. Jennifer isn't so sure if the finances will work. Jamie, though, he feels lucky.Ira GlassChris Benderev, he's one of the producers of today's episode.Act Three: Limp BiscuitIra GlassAct Four, Last Stand. Saturday night, the part of the park with rides for little kids closes down at 10:00 PM I stopped by there a little before that, wondering if I can talk to Jeremy, the agent of the watergun game.BarryCome up. Look, I got a family special here for you guys. Closing special, guys. If I get four people to play, whoever wins gets a big choice prize.Ira GlassThat hoarse, exhausted-sounding person is Barry, who's doing stock, handling prizes for Jeremy earlier in the day. Now, Jeremy's the one handling prizes, and Barry is on the mic.BarryRight here, are you ready? Have a seat. That's one. I need at least two to start.Ira GlassThere are a few straggler families left, and they are keeping themselves as far as they can from Barry, holding a distance of maybe 35, 40 feet. They look beat, and they are not interested in Barry's shenanigans on the mic. Finally, one woman sits down at the game.BarryI got one in the door. I need at least one more person to start. I see you peeking out there. You can't win it by looking at it, girl. Come on, give it a shot. Show them how it's done.Ira GlassSecond woman pulls up in a motorized wheelchair. Barry pleads with people to sit. And when I ask him what this is about--[CHATTER]BarryWe're $100 short from our goal tonight.Ira GlassJeremy tells me that they have a goal to bring in $10,000 that day for the game.BarryGive it a shot. Look.Ira GlassAnd I want to be clear, this was not management that set this goal. Jeremy did, he said. That's the number he wanted to hit. He and Barry each got a percentage of that $10,000. And they decided on how much they wanted to make for the day. And then they were going to use everything they had to make that number, begging people to sit down.BarryThere you go. I got two in the door. I'm looking for two more. What? I need more than two.Ira GlassBarry ends up running a modified two-person version of the game for a smaller prize and keeps going with more rounds.BarryWho's ready? Who's next?Ira Glass10:00 comes. The rides around us starts shutting down. Ferris wheel lights go off. That feels weird. This gigantic, multi-colored bright thing, suddenly pitch dark. Very tired clumps of people wander past it towards parking lots. But the water gun race is an island of light and noise.BarryCome on. Come on. Last race. Last race of the night. Have a seat, guys. Come on. One more time. We're going to give another big one away, guys. Last race of the night. Last race of the night, guys. Come on up. Give it a shot. One more person.Ira GlassThey finally run their last race four minutes after 10:00.Barry3, 2, 1.Ira GlassFour minutes after this part of the park officially closed.BarryDon't spill. It's neck and neck. It's toe to toe. Go, go, go, go, go. Who's it going to be? Stop, watch, and see. Number![BELL RINGING]Winner, winner, winner. 22, any prize, any size. All right, guys, have a great rest of your night. Thank you all. Appreciate you.Customer 4Whatever.Customer 5I didn't win.Ira GlassThey're done. Sound system is off. They made their goal, they told me. Jeremy said, when 10:00 hit, of course, they had to keep going.Jeremy BuvierWe had a goal. We needed $5 more. All right, we got to flash.BarryYeah, we got to do stuff.Ira GlassGot to flash means they're not done for the night. They have to head over to where the prizes are stored, get some prizes, come back to the game, and put them in place for tomorrow. He said they started to work around 9:00 that morning. It was 10:00 at night. They had another hour's work to go. We kept going, Jeremy said, because we like money.Act Four: Last Stand (Podcast Only)Ira GlassOur program was produced today by Chris Benderev and Ike Sriskandarajah.

One million come to the State Fair. I'm strolling past the swine barn, and the kids' talent show stage, and the lemonade shake up stands, and the many, many corn dog stands, and the Central Iowa Railroad Club Exhibit building, and the chainsaw art, and the live snakes, and the vast, slowly moving rivers of people.Every one of those million is here on their own personal quest for what they want out of the fair. Stuff they want to do, stuff they want to see, everybody has their own mission. Declan and Killian, for instance, seven and nine years old, brothers from a suburb of Des Moines. They want to see the giant bull. Killian, the big brother, talked to my co-worker, Diane Wu.Diane WuWhy are you so excited to see the bull?KillianIt's one of my favorite animals.Diane WuHow come?KillianThey can see red, and red is my favorite color.DeclanWhat? You said it was black every day.Ira GlassHis little brother Declan with a fact check about Killian's favorite color being black. Another fact check-- bulls can't actually see red. The boys wander around the outside of the cattle barn, looking for the right entrance.KillianSuper sized bull.Diane WuOh, I wonder if--KillianThat way.Diane WuYep.Ira GlassThe bull's name is Teddy Bear, and it weighs 3,060 pounds. Signs duct taped onto the pen say, do not touch the bull, which is, like, yeah.Diane WuWhat do you think?KillianThat's cool. And big. I thought it would be smaller.Diane WuYou thought it would be smaller.KillianA little bit.Ira GlassWhen you see a giant animal, if you're a kid or an adult, what is there to say other than, yeah, OK. That's about right. Elsewhere--[GUNSHOTS]Adam RossCowboy-mounted shooting is one of the fastest growing equestrian sports in the country. It's a timed event where we use two 45 single-action long Colt pistols.Ira GlassIn the cowboy-mounted shooting competition, each competitor is on horseback. And they ride a course, shooting burning embers from their guns. They try to pop five balloons with one pistol. Then they change guns, shoot five more balloons with the other pistol, then gallop to the finish line, all without stopping.Adam RossSome of these runs we're going to be doing today are going to be nine seconds, because that's less than a second per shot with a gun change. It's a lot happening all at once.Ira GlassAdam Ross is actually ranked sixth in the world at this sport, but somehow, he has never won first place here in his home state of Iowa. That's his mission for this year's fair, he told my co-worker, Ike Sriskandarajah.Adam RossI'm naturally competitive. When everybody else puts their horses away in the winter, me and my wife take our horses to the barn and we ride all winter long. We try to outwork every one of our competitors.Ike SriskandarajahAnd when you survey this room of competitive riders in your level, who's the one you're most keeping an eye on?Adam RossI look right in the mirror at myself. I know that I'm the fastest one here. I have the horse that's the most proven here this year. So as long as I don't beat myself when I go out there and run my match, I know that there's nobody that will compete with me.[CHATTER][CHOIR MUSIC]Group(SINGING) God will be with you until we meet againHe blows better floating o'er youIra GlassA slightly slower pace over at the replica of Iowa's first church. The original was built in 1834. It's a cozy log cabin, where the goal is to reflect on God's goodness right in the middle of a gigantic, noisy carnival. They hold services twice a day during the fair, where Iowans are not officially permitted to pray, but they are, the guy leading the service says, allowed have to sing prayers.Group[VOCALIZING]ManThank you.[APPLAUSE]Ira GlassHigh above nearly everything at this fair, looking down on everyone, stands Byaunda, age 11, on the giant slide for her very first time. It is a massive metal slide that you fly down on a felt mat. And she has a simple goal of her own.ByaundaSo we're going to go on the slide. And I'm very terrified right now because one wrong move, and I'm done.Ira GlassAnd then she and her sister, Asele, grab their mats and push off.[SCREAMING]ByaundaOh my god.[LAUGHTER]Ira GlassThe Varied Industries building is an enjoyable mishmash of t-shirts and household stuff for sale, but also expensive devices to help your blood circulation or your horse's blood circulation, plus, a guy in one of the more surprising missions at the fair, I thought.Marty GoldenNow, this is--Ira GlassMarty Golden, in a neatly pressed blue uniform and Navy hat, was standing in front of a booth promoting theUSSIowabattleship, a World War II-era ship that's now a floating museum, its restoration paid for in part by grants from the state of Iowa.Marty GoldenWe want to make the citizens of Iowa more aware of the battleshipIowaand let them know that anybody that's a resident of the state of Iowa gets on board theIowabattleship for free. And if they let us know they're from Iowa, we'll take them behind the scenes to places that are not opened up to the general public.Ira GlassBut there's a catch. Iowa happens to be landlocked. The ship is docked in Los Angeles, hence Marty's mission to get Iowans out there. Marty did two years in the Navy, 30 years in the Reserves. He served on a ship right off the coast of Havana during the Cuban Missile Crisis. He's also a marine biologist who studied ocean life, retired now. But he loved the Navy enough that now, he's a tour guide on theIowa,which, again, is in the Port of Los Angeles. Marty is not an Iowan. He lives out there.Marty GoldenI miss the Navy so much that I volunteer now about once a week down on the battleshipIowa.Ira GlassAnd they flew you out here?[CHATTER]Marty GoldenMore or less.Ira GlassOh, you flew yourself out here.Marty GoldenI contributed a substantial amount of the effort to get out here.Ira GlassSo basically, you said, let me go and do this. It'll be fun. And they're like, great.Marty GoldenYeah, they probably would have covered all of my expenses, but I believe in the ship. And the ship is always struggling to bring money in to keep operating.Ira GlassSo you didn't want to take any money away that could have gone to the battleship?Marty GoldenCorrect.Ira GlassThe Iowa State Fair began in 1854, just eight years after Iowa became a state. They hadn't even picked a location to build their State Capitol building yet, but they wanted to come together for a fair, for reasons that aren't that different from why we do it today. And what are they?I think at a state fair, so much of what's on exhibit is us. We come, with the animals we raised, and our pies and sewing projects, our spelling bee skills, and our expertise at shooting balloons from horseback, and our love for a Navy museum battleship that we think others would love also if we could just tell them about it in person.We take in the exhibits and we are the exhibits at a state fair. That's what's so different about a state fair from everything else. Today, we hang out with some of the one million people at the fair and see if they get what they wanted and dreamed of from the fair this year. From WBEZ Chicago,ThisAmericanLife.I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.Act One: Carny ConfidentialIra GlassThis AmericanLife,Act One, Carney Confidential. So Bailey Leavitt has a different relationship to state fairs and carnivals from most of us.Bailey LeavittIt always feels good to be back on a midway. When I come out here, I smell it. It just feels like home to me.Ira GlassBailey grew up in carnivals, comes from a family of carnies.Ira GlassWait, I'm smelling. What is the smell you're talking about?[CHATTER]Bailey LeavittSo I smell turkey legs, for sure. I could smell the cotton candy, that burnt sugar smell. And there's always an underlying kind of grease smell, the diesel smell from the rides and from the generator, which is giving power to all the rides. It's so comforting to me.Ira GlassBailey read on Instagram that we were going to be doing this show about state fairs and she wrote in, talking about her family's life on the road as carnies, mostly out west. I thought it would be fun to walk through the midway with her and see it through her eyes, because she notices all kinds of stuff, big and little, that you and I don't know enough to notice. She grew up with a different vocabulary for everything around us here. She calls all the games joints.Bailey LeavittWell, it's a four-sided joint, but then three sides--Ira GlassCotton candy stands are poppers. Food stands are grabs. Prizes are flash. Carnivals themselves are shows, as in--Bailey LeavittHe's actually still on that show. And I think he's managing rides now.Ira Glass--a bunch of different shows. 13 independent companies provide the games and rides for the Iowa State Fair. We walk up to a balloon game that must be, I don't know, 20, 25 feet tall, a structure made from aluminum scaffolding with flags and prizes hanging everywhere, and two giant banners saying, bust one wins. Bailey gives it a once over. She's impressed.Bailey LeavittYou can tell that they take good care of the joint because you see how clean all this stuff is, where all those connection points are?Ira GlassYou're pointing to the frame of the stand itself.Bailey LeavittYeah, the joints where different pieces link up for this game. All that stuff is really well maintained.Ira GlassBailey tries to spot who's green help and who's a 40 miler-- that means just there for a bit-- and who's a genuine carny. Before I met Bailey, I honestly wasn't so sure if people still use the word carny or if it has some sort of derogatory, old-timey feeling to it. She told me some carnies hate the word, but she and her family embrace it with pride. These days, Bailey works for a little software company that her mom started.Two of Bailey's brothers and her sister are still on the show, and her dad and stepmother were in a show in Alaska that her dad tries to pull her back into now and then. Bailey has happy memories growing up, running around carnivals and state fairs. She could ride any ride or play any game for free, surrounded by adults, her parents' employees, who kept their eyes on her. There were incredibly special days, like stock day, when the stuffed animals for the fair, the stock, would arrive on a giant semi-trailer truck.Bailey LeavittAnd it was a giant pile of toys that I could literally jump in and swim in like a ball pit, but with stuffed animals. That was my favorite.Ira GlassBailey started to work in the fair for real when she was 10, working a goldfish game.Bailey LeavittA four-sided center joint.Ira GlassBailey's mom, Tyna, joined us for a while in the midway. She was watching Bailey's baby while Bailey and I walked around. Tyna co-managed the family carnival for years and jokes that her kids learned to count by counting money. Says Bailey was great at drawing a crowd, loved the attention, loved performing. When she was little, her flaw as an employee? She did not care about convincing people to spend more money on the game.TynaShe would sit there and talk to people. And sometimes, she would get in trouble because, if she's talking to people, she's not actually making money. She's just talking to people. But then as she got older, she focused a little bit better, but--Bailey LeavittWeird that your child labor didn't pay off like you thought it would.TynaChild labor laws do not apply to family, and they learn that very young.Bailey LeavittYes. [LAUGHS]Ira GlassIs that true?TynaIt is true. At least, that's what I told them. And they believed me.Ira GlassMom was actually right about that one. Something you don't think about too deeply as a civilian fairgoer, looking for fun, is that for the people working the fair, it really is all about money, how much you can make and how quickly and efficiently you can bring it in. Among other things, a state fair is a collection of small businesses attracted by the massive crowds. And among the people like Bailey, who work games and rides, the workers who make the most money are called agents.The word "agent" means different things in different regions of the country among carnies. But where Bailey was a carny, agents were just the best there was, so good at getting families and guys trying to impress their girlfriends to throw money at games that carnival owners would pay them more than anybody else, and they would jump from show to show. They're agents, as in free agents. As we walk through the fairgrounds, the thing that Bailey wanted to show me more than anything was an agent.Bailey LeavittYeah, so an agent is someone who can do what we call putting a mark to sleep, where they're going to be able to kind of put you in this state where alls you want to do is continue playing their game. You want to work towards whatever prize they have you working towards, whether it's popping balloons, or knocking over milk bottles, or whatever. You're going to spend way more money than you planned on at that game. And whenever you get somebody in that state, if you're able to do it really well, it's called putting a mark to sleep.Ira GlassBailey and her stepdad once watched an agent who put a mark to sleep so well that he spent all of his money, left the game, and then came back with more money.Bailey LeavittI'm getting chills as I talk about it. I've never seen anybody do that. Once a mark leaves your game, usually, they're awake and it's done.Ira GlassI wanted to see this. I wanted to see an operator who put somebody to sleep. So we headed out in search of an agent.Bailey LeavittThere's going to be a lot of agents here.Barker 1Come on up and come on in, guys. Who else wants to have some water gun fun today?Ira GlassWe head over to a game where there's a row of 14 chairs in front of 14 targets. The way this game works is you sit and fire a water pistol at the target. When you hit the bullseye, the water goes into a tube, filling it up. First player to fill their tube wins a stuffed doll.Barker 1All right.[CHATTER]We got number one.Ira GlassThese long pauses you're hearing, Bailey disapproves.Barker 1All right.Ira GlassThis guy's trying to get people to sit and play the game. Three players sit, then a fourth. 10 seats are empty.Barker 1Last call for this race. At the sound of the bell, the water will start. Everybody ready in 3, 2, 1. Here we go. Go, go, go. All the way to the top. Keep your eye on this dot. Don't look up. It's water racing and water chasing today. Number eight, winner, winner, winner!Ira GlassSo what do you think of him?Bailey LeavittHe's OK. He's not the best I've seen, but he's not the worst.Bailey LeavittHe's doing good at trying to engage people and make them play, but he's had a lot of pauses where he's not talking at all.Ira GlassBailey knows this particular game well, the water race. She's been the one on the mic running the water race for her dad's carnival in Alaska.Barker 11 and 2.Ira GlassShe was taught to do lots of rhyming when you're on the mic, lots of alliteration, like watch them race them, watch them chase them. That's one she did. This guy does not do much of that. Also--Bailey LeavittHe's only getting three to four players each time.Ira GlassDo you think he can be pulling in more people?Bailey LeavittAbsolutely, yeah. It's a nice game. It has great stock. The joint looks really nice, really clean. But they could be making a lot more money, in my opinion.Ira GlassDo you think this guy is an agent?Bailey LeavittNo, definitely not.Ira GlassWe cross the fairgrounds, find another water race game, and this one's huge and beautiful, 26 seats instead of 14 like the first one. It's what Bailey calls a double-sided joint. There are two rows of chairs facing each other, and the guy on the mic stands in the middle on a platform between the two rows. Huge, fluffy prizes hanging everywhere. And the guy on the mic--Jeremy BuvierGet ready, get set, go, go, go, go. All right, don't waste the drippity drop trying to get to the tippity top. Stop, watch, and see. Who's it going to be? And the winner is--Bailey LeavittRight there, all that rhyming, the alliteration.Ira GlassAlliteration.Bailey LeavittYeah.Jeremy BuvierNumber 18, winner, winner, winner.Bailey LeavittHe's constantly talking. He's using a lot of alliteration, and rhyming, and catchy things to draw people in.Ira GlassEven I can tell, this guy's got charisma. He's a stocky, bald guy with a five o'clock shadow. When he's on the mic, you cannot look away.Jeremy BuvierYou guys ready?Ira GlassAnd that great, gruff, rock and roll voice.Jeremy BuvierGet ready, get set, go, go, go. Who's it going to be? Stop, watch, and see. Oh, man. It's close. It's neck to neck. It's toe to toe. Don't waste the drippity drop. Winner, winner, winner, winner, winner, winner, winner, winner, winner, winner, winner, chicken dinner.Bailey LeavittYeah, this setup is great. They've got really hyped up music, flashing lights. They also got their mic turned up, so his voice is a lot more clear than that other guy.Jeremy BuvierDidn't want to do that quick, huh? All right, let's see.Bailey LeavittAnd he's playing off his customers. He's joking around with them.Jeremy BuvierDo it again. All right.Bailey LeavittYeah, he's good at what he does.Jeremy BuvierLook it, brother.Ira GlassBailey's mom, former carnival manager, she's watching him, too.TynaHe's not a 40-miler. He's a carny.Jeremy BuvierCome on.Ira GlassI do get the guy to talk to me in little snatches of conversation while winners are picking their prizes. His name is Jeremy Buvier.Ira GlassHow long have you been doing this?Jeremy Buvier24 years.Ira GlassHow many months of the year do you work?Jeremy BuvierAll year.Barker 3Winner, winner, winner.Ira GlassYou work all year. Do you have a house or apartment somewhere that's yours?Jeremy BuvierI had an apartment up until January. I got tired of paying for it because I'm always gone. I'm buying a motor home in November.Ira GlassSo if you have a motor home, then you just take the motor home with you as you travel?Jeremy BuvierYep.Ira GlassWhat city was the apartment in?Jeremy BuvierLewiston, Maine. That's where I'm from.Ira GlassAnd who do you travel with?Jeremy BuvierI go-- I bounce around.Ira GlassBounce around. So this isn't-- you don't just travel with this ride?Jeremy BuvierNo.Ira GlassAnd you're staying in bunks here?Jeremy BuvierNo, I stay at hotels.Ira GlassSo you're doing good?Jeremy BuvierYes.Ira GlassWhat percentage are they paying you of the gross here?Jeremy BuvierI can't tell you that. It's good money, though.Ira GlassSo are you an agent?Jeremy BuvierPretty much. All right, I got to get back to work, though.Bailey LeavittHe's with it. He's an agent. You heard him talking about how he floats around and he just goes to different shows, he doesn't travel with any particular show-- that's all agent stuff. Staying in hotels-- agent. Agent all the way. Not talking about money-- agent. That's all agent moves.Ira GlassSo we saw an agent. But the truth is, we never got to see him really do his thing full force, because it was after 8:00 PM. This section of the fair, kiddieland, was dying down. So he never filled more than half the seats in his game. We didn't see him put anybody to sleep and keep them playing and spending money.But there was one more person Bailey and I watched. He was not, strictly speaking, a fellow carny. He was a salesman, a traveling salesman. But Bailey and I both watched him, mesmerized. And he was in one of the prime spots that anybody could possibly get at this state fair for selling anything.This was outside the Varied Industries building, next to the door, and also the corner of the building. So you saw him approaching from two different directions. The Iowa State Fair charges a bunch of extra money for that spot, of course. This guy was calmly making bank-- Kenny Burnell. He sells nozzles for garden hoses.Kenny BurnellWell, I have them in any color you want as long as it's green.Ira GlassSome agents, Bailey says, are high-energy, but some are the opposite. They win through calm. That's Kenny. And OK, just to describe his setup, he's standing next to a clear glass box that's maybe two feet by two feet by two feet, spraying water into it with a garden hose, whose nozzle Kenny twists clockwise or counterclockwise to make the spray bigger or smaller.Kenny BurnellGoing from left to right, you're going to have a little soft soak for potted plants. You've got a heavy rinse. You can get the house, the car, the windows. You got a wide fan. As you turn it, we'll go down to a pinpoint jet spray that'll clean the windows, the siding, and the gutters. And last but not least, you get a fine mist for delicate plants. That way--Bailey LeavittThis guy, he puts people to sleep. He's putting marks to sleep. That's what he's doing.[CHATTER]And he's good at it. Even his voice is kind of hypnotic, kind of getting them in the zone.Ira GlassWe stare at him as he puts people to sleep.Kenny BurnellAnd if you guys need a second one for the backyard, we do two for 75. You guys like to feel it as well.Customer 1We bought one, then we bought another. Now we're going to buy another.Kenny BurnellThank you. I appreciate that.Bailey LeavittHe's got a great visual presentation, but he's just really-- he has a really calm energy. And so you feel like this is a comforting guy, safe. So yeah, of course he's going to make the sale.Ira GlassWith every new group of customers, Kenny hits the product against the ground to show how durable it is. He makes the same jokes.Kenny BurnellAnd I have them in any color you want as long as it's green.Customer 2No purple?Kenny BurnellNo purple yet.Ira GlassWhen he gets a minute between customers to talk, Kenny Burnell tells me that his grandfather sold at state fairs, and his father. His own first memory of selling is doing a salsa maker demo at the Colorado State Fair one time with his dad when he was five and a half. He enjoyed it. When he was 10, he toured with his parents to state fairs and had his own booth, selling radio-controlled cars. As he got older, he learned to demo kitchen products.Kenny Burnell--and was pretty decent at it. But in my early teens, I was like, my heart's really not into kitchen gadgets, just not something I felt. And then I took a liking to this product. And I was like, I want to sell that.Ira GlassHe wanted to sell that because it has a great visual pitch. It's a quick pitch. Also, the water is loud. It's attention-getting. There's a wow moment when you hit the jet spray. And there's another wow moment when you go to the mist. And another advantage of these things? They're tiny.Kenny BurnellYou can fit a whole fair's worth of inventory on one pallet.Ira GlassA quick trade show-- he can check all the nozzles he needs into a carry on bag. Way better, he says, than when he sold pillows. It was 24 years ago when he started selling these. Some of his moves today, of course, he doesn't stop talking. Of course, he puts the product in the customer's hand. That's something he saw his dad do.He's learned that to talk for 12 hours straight for a week and a half for a state fair, to preserve his voice, he'll consciously pitch it a little higher or a little lower for stretches at a time. Here in the Midwest, and also in certain cities like Seattle, he said, he mostly does not make direct eye contact during the pitch. I noticed that.Kenny BurnellI was taught and raised to always make direct eye contact. What I found nowadays is I'll make eye contact roughly three times a demo. That's what I aim for-- one in the beginning, one in the middle, one right at the end when you're explaining the warranty and how much they are, but not too much, because I've done that a few times at this fair, where I'm making-- I'm demoing and doing it East Coast style. I'm making direct eye contact, and you can see them kind of looking off down the aisle. And they're just intimidated. And I don't want that. It's--Ira GlassIt's too aggressive to do the eye contact.Kenny BurnellIt's too aggressive, yeah.Ira GlassKenny, this is Bailey, who's worked a ton of fairs, a ton of carnivals.Bailey LeavittI grew up in the carnivals. So I just think you're great at what you do.Kenny BurnellThank you. I appreciate that.Bailey LeavittYeah.Ira GlassAnd then they got into a little chat about headset microphones. Bailey wanted to know why he didn't use one. Kenny was like, I usually do, but I had a problem with my mic and then a problem with my backup mic. Bailey was sympathetic. They liked each other. Game recognizes game. In my line of work, I have to say, putting somebody to sleep means you are not doing your job right. It's one of the worst things you can say to somebody.When I told Kenny that's what Bailey said about him, he laughed and decided to take it as the compliment it was. He ended up selling $33,000 worth of nozzles over the course of the fair. That's 877 nozzles in 11 days, or put another way, for 12 hours a day, every single day, Kenny sold an average of one hose nozzle every 10 minutes.Coming up, we go on a roller coaster of sorts, one filled with bunnies. That's in a minute from Chicago Public Radio when our program continues.ThisAmericanLife.I'm Ira Glass. Today's show, "Meet Me at the Fair," we hang out with some of the 1.2 million people who came to the Iowa State Fair this year to see if they got what they hoped for. And we'll get back to that in a second. But first, let me tell you a story. Back in 2013, the band Motley Crue was getting older. One of its founding members had gotten a degenerative disease. The drummer, Tommy Lee, was going around saying they wanted to stop doing shows before they had to start replacing bandmates.Tommy LeeThat's such a bad look, when bands are still playing the [BLEEP] fairgrounds.Ira GlassA year later, Tommy Lee said, we are not playing county fairs. But Wednesday night, at the Iowa State Fair this year, Motley Crue played. They rocked. Fans partied.FanLegalize cocaine! Hell yeah![SHOUTING][CHATTER]Dana ChivvisHow was the show?FanHuh?Dana ChivvisHow was the show?FanDude, I'm so [BLEEP] drunk, I can't [BLEEP] remember that [BLEEP].Ira GlassCurious about what it is like for the band to do this thing that they had sworn repeatedly they would never, ever do, we asked for an interview. The band said yes. And then a day later, we were told they would still love to talk to us, with one condition. They would not discuss playing state fairs.In other words, Motley Crue is chicken. So I just want to say to the band right now, our offer is still good. We actually do want to hear what this is like for you to do this. Reach out if you change your minds. And with that, we turn to Act Two of our show.Grandstand Chicken (Podcast Only)Ira GlassAct Two, How Bad is Your Bunny? So many people who come to the fair arrive with dreams tied to farmyard animals. There are non-stop animal competitions in hundreds of categories, all 11 days of the fair. One of our co-workers, Dana Chivvis, went to watch the 4H rabbit competition. She had no idea what an emotional roller coaster it would turn out to be. The 4H rabbit program is meant to teach kids lessons about animal science, and breeding, and caretaking, which they do learn, along with some other lessons. Here's Dana.Dana ChivvisThe rabbit show takes place in an industrial building on the outskirts of the fair-- tin roof, beige, metal siding, no frills. Rabbits don't get the respect they deserve, except from the kids.Dana ChivvisHello.Molly FoxHi.Dana ChivvisI'm Dana. What's your name?Molly FoxI'm Molly Fox.Dana ChivvisMolly has shown rabbits at the county fair before, but this is her first year at the state fair, the big time. She's waiting in line to present the incredibly fuzzy black rabbit in her arms, a breed called Lionhead, named for the poof of mane it's supposed to have around its head. This competition is about presentation skills, demonstrating your knowledge about your animal's breed to a panel of three judges. Molly tells me she's not nervous. She carries her bunny to the judges' table.JudgeAll right, you may start whenever you are ready.Molly FoxHi. My name is Molly Fox, I'm 12 years old, and I'm from Hamilton County. This is Onyx. He is a junior buck Lionhead, and his color is black. First, I'm going to check the ears. Let me find the ear tattoo. There's so much fluff.Dana ChivvisMolly flips Onyx onto his back and opens his little rabbit mouth so his teeth show. So she's checking for buck teeth, pegged teeth.Molly FoxMalocclusion, wolf teeth, and broken or chipped teeth.Dana ChivvisThe goal here is for the kids to look for the things a veteran judge would look for if they were evaluating this rabbit. Molly runs through the checklist she memorized with her dad, ears, nose, teeth, and then wraps it up with this professional assessment.Molly FoxI would like to see more of the wool type of fur on his hind legs. But overall, he is a very-- he is an excellent rabbit.Dana ChivvisMolly has learned her 4H lessons well. The judges have no questions. She gets 94 points out of 100. Most of the kids I meet are proud of their rabbits. They talk about how soft they are, how nice their markings are, except for Jillian King, who is 11 and who has absolutely had it with her rabbit.Jillian KingBecause he's molting and he's really ugly right now. So I could get rid of him.Jillian's MomOh, babe.Jillian KingThat sounds bad, but it's true.Jillian's MomIt sounds awful.Jillian KingHe needs more hair. He doesn't match breed standards. He's just the best rabbit I had for this right now.Dana ChivvisThe rabbit in question is named Chacho. He's small and brown and has a bad case of bedhead, hair puffed out in all the wrong places, and a look that says he knows he screwed up.Dana ChivvisOh, he's so cute though.Jillian KingHe is cute, but not cute enough to be like that.Dana ChivvisWhat's his breed again?Jillian KingLionhead.Dana ChivvisOh, he's a Lionhead. I want to see the Lionheads.Jillian KingWell, there's better breed standards ones over here. He is not quite up to the best breed standard.Dana ChivvisSo you said.Jillian KingBut the better ones are over there.Dana ChivvisJillian takes me a few rows over and points to two bunnies. And holy hell, I am telling you, these bunnies are some good-ass-looking bunnies, with that kind of calm demeanor that comes with effortless beauty. One is brownish-gray with dark brown ears that stick up in a regal way and hair that seems feline. The other one has a classically pretty bunny face, light brown, chubby cheeks, button nose. He's sitting up like a dog-- or like a bunny, I guess-- his eyes locked on the back of Chacho's fuzzy head.Dana ChivvisWow.Jillian KingThese two are very up to breed standards. They are gorgeous. They have a perfect mane, and skirt, and saddle, and everything that you should see.If you compare--Dana ChivvisJillian holds Chacho up in front of these hot bunnies so I can see the difference.Jillian KingHe should have a lot more hair. His hair didn't grow out as well, but he's also molting. So he's losing a lot of it right now, but it'll grow back.Dana ChivvisHe's going through an awkward phase right now, though. Poor guy.Jillian KingBut he's still not as good as these guys. These guys would beat him in a regular show. They would just easily beat him. They're just better.Dana ChivvisAw.At the rabbit show, each rabbit is sized up against its breed standards. And then the judge awards the rabbit handler a ribbon. Confoundingly, purple is the best, followed by blue. A blue ribbon says your rabbit is up to breed standards, but isn't exceptional enough to get a purple. Next is red, which means your rabbit is a delinquent, and then white, which means you are a delinquent.Jillian and her older sister Jenna are both having a bad "hare" day. Get it? Chacho is a mess. And Jenna's best rabbit, Martini, just got disqualified. Jenna is sitting in a camping chair in tears.JennaI'm Jenna.Dana ChivvisCan I ask you what happened?JennaSo I breed Harlequin rabbits. I was told one of my rabbits is sick, that her nose is running. And she's the best coloring I've got, and I don't know why she's sick. I'm just super disappointed right now.Dana ChivvisDisappointed and also worried. She loves this snotty rabbit. We walk over to Martini, who's lying across the back of her cage.JennaThat's Martini.Dana ChivvisShe's beautiful.JennaYeah.Dana ChivvisShe has black and white bands across her body, and a perfect face split, which is to say, half her muzzle is white and half is black, a very desirable trait in a Harlequin rabbit.Dana ChivvisShe's not happy.To my untrained eye, she seems pissed. Jenna says Martini and her sister, Tequila, don't really like people. She bred them herself, choosing to pair a rabbit named Whiskey with good coloring to a lady rabbit named Fawn, who has a great face split. Out of that blessed union, Martini was born.JennaIt was the week that things got really cold in January, like, negative 40. Half of her litter did not make it. It really sucked. But her mom got two of them through, which is good. So she's like a little miracle rabbit.Dana ChivvisWas that really sad?JennaYeah. It was my first litter, too. So that was a little bit rough, but you can't let it hold you back. You only get better the farther along you go. You can't really quit in the beginning.Dana ChivvisWell, I guess you could if you wanted, but--JennaYeah, but--Dana ChivvisJenna and I have a difference of opinion here. I'm totally for quitting, especially if the activity involves frozen bunnies. As we're admiring Martini, Jenna's mother, TJ, walks up with news.JennaShe doesn't-- she's what?TJShe's allergic to the sawdust. I just talked to that guy who said, hey, it's an allergy. They did--Dana ChivvisMartini is not sick. She does not have snuffles, which is rabbit sniffles. She's just allergic to the sawdust they put in all the rabbit cages at the fair. Jenna doesn't use sawdust at home, so she had no way of knowing this. She's crying again.JennaThat's so good to know.TJRight. I said, we're learning things the hard way this year, and that sucks.Dana ChivvisI suspect the lesson TJ is referring to is don't put sawdust in a rabbit cage. But I could see another lesson appearing on the horizon, one about the inevitability of disappointment, how disappointment leads to growth, how you don't need some technocrat from the bunny industrial complex to hand you a ribbon to know in your heart that you've got an outstanding rabbit.Dana ChivvisHow does that make you feel? Better?JennaYeah, way better. I really thought something might have happened and I didn't see it. I was kind of worried.TJAnd they invited us to the show in Boone in October because she's a phenomenal rabbit. [LAUGHS]JennaYay.TJCome here. Come here.Dana ChivvisThey hug it out.JennaI'm glad now that we know it's just an allergy. That makes me feel, again, 20 times better.TJDid you just hear what they said over the loudspeaker?JennaNo.TJFor Harlequins? The best rabbit here today had to be disqualified.Dana ChivvisUnderstanding washes over Jenna's face. More tears.TJDon't cry. I'm going to cry for you. You know what that means? You know what it means?JennaI don't want to show Martini again when she's not hay chip sick.TJYes. And that your breeding program is exactly on track where you want it to be. That is the moment you take away from this, that you did something phenomenal genetically. It's not about the show. I'm so proud. You be proud of that.JennaI need some Kleenex.TJI know. Me too. I don't have any. Don't cry.JennaThat's great. I'm excited to breed her now.Dana ChivvisJenna plans to match Martini with Mo, the rabbit in the cage next door, who's a few months younger than Martini and seems like a doofus. But I'm no expert.And what about poor Chacho, Jillian's discombobulated rabbit? He ends up getting a red ribbon, which is second to worst, or if you ask Chacho, third best. Jillian's surprised.Jillian KingIt was better than I was expecting.Dana ChivvisYeah, are you less mad at him now?Jillian KingNo, not really. I'm still getting rid of him. So he's cute, but he's not what I'm looking for to bring into my breeding program.Dana ChivvisThe lesson Chacho takes home from the State Fair is show business isn't for everyone, but he has a happy retirement to look forward to. Jillian plans to sell him to a good home, where he'll be someone's pet-- or maybe better for Chacho, the young buck in someone else's probably unsuccessful breeding program.Ira GlassDana Chivvis is a producer on our show. One quick program note before we go any further. Some of you may have noticed a word usage that you're getting ready to email us about. I just want to say right now, yes, we know that a hare is not the same thing as a rabbit. But can I say, puns breed around this office like punnies.Act Two: How Bad is Your Bunny?Ira GlassAct Three, Limp Biscuit. So every Iowan that I talked to outside the fair this year, when I mentioned that I was going to the fair, what we would end up talking about was food and what to eat. Food is a big thing at so many state fairs. News coverage of Iowa's fair always includes the latest stuff, like this year's bacon cheeseburger egg roll.There are nearly 200 food stands at the fair, and they rarely become available for people who want to try to create the next hit themselves. Those spots are highly coveted because there's so much money to be made. Fair's management says that some vendors earn their entire annual income for the year at those 11 days at the fair. Chris Benderev had followed one family that tried to jump into the game this year.Chris BenderevOf the handful of new food stands at the fair this year, it was obvious which one would be the most interesting to watch. It's run by a couple, Jamie and Jennifer Adkins. And as best as I can tell, they're different from the other food stand managers at the fair in one important way.Chris BenderevSo you guys have not run a restaurant before?Jennifer AdkinsThat's correct.Chris BenderevAnd you guys haven't run your own stand at another state fair before.Jennifer AdkinsCorrect. This is our first big gig.Chris BenderevAll the other new food stands in Iowa this year are owned and run by people in the restaurant business, or they've done other big fairs. So how did Jamie and Jennifer end up doing this? Well, for a long time, Jennifer had dreamt of opening her own coffee shop. Then her husband saw this opportunity, not to launch a coffee shop exactly, but to launch an 11-day-long state fair version of it.He heard about a food stand that was withdrawing from the state fair. They could save money by buying its used trailer and equipment. Jennifer could sell coffee drinks, and they'd do some food on the side-- biscuit sandwiches, they decided, because there aren't many vendors selling breakfast at the fair. And so they jumped in and prepared to launch Biscuit Bar. But when I talked to them in July, before the fair opened, they each had very different expectations for how much money they'd make.Jennifer AdkinsI tend to be more frugal and conservative about finances, so I'm really just hoping to be able to help pay for some of the expenses that we've had. That's really what I'm hoping for.Chris BenderevJennifer just wants to break even, cover all their costs, but she told me she didn't think they'd do that. The costs were too big. They'd spent $300,000 for the trailer and all the equipment. And that's before you get to salaries and food costs. Plus, the State Fair takes 19.5% of every dollar every food vendor brings in. Jamie, her husband, owns a successful trucking business. And when I reached him by phone, he was confident they'd make everything back this first year.Jamie AdkinsIt'll work. I guarantee that it'll work. No doubt about it. It'll work. It's just how much the profit is. My personal thought for this year was, I'd like to do about gross sales of $300,000, $350,000 on the minimum side. It's kind of like going to the casino. [LAUGHS] You go there to win. You just hope you win more than you lose.Chris BenderevThis kind of confidence, of course, is exactly what you'd need if you're an amateur and you decided you're going to get into any part of the restaurant business, a notoriously difficult business to make money in. But Jamie has a cousin, Joni, who runs two popular, very successful food stands at the fair. Jamie's helped her out a little in the past. And seeing his cousin's operation made the idea of raking in lots of cash seem way more possible, at least for him. Again, here's his wife, Jennifer.Jennifer AdkinsProbably for him, because it really looks effortless for her. She's just so good. And there's no way I'd ever be able to get up to her level. And I think for him, she really is inspiring, for sure. [LAUGHS]Chris BenderevCould that be almost a tricky thing because she makes it look deceptively simple?Jennifer AdkinsPossibly, yes.[CLATTER]6:30 AM, August 8, the first day of the fair. And this, employees scraping cooked food out of pots into storage containers, is the sound of a food stand about to debut itself to Iowa. The gates of the fair don't open until 8:00 AM, so let me give you a sense of the place. Right now, I'm in the open-air kitchen that's behind Biscuit Bar. This is where all the raw materials, meats and eggs and biscuits, are cooked, and then get passed into the trailer, where they're assembled into sandwiches. Everyone's calm. They're ready.Chris BenderevCan I ask what you guys are doing at this point?JeffCleaning tubs.Chris BenderevCleaning tubs.JeffAll our-- we got all our stuff made.Chris BenderevThe trailer Jamie and Jennifer paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for is gleaming, with a green and pink facade, emblazoned with real pictures of biscuit sandwiches, but also cartoons of friendly anthropomorphized biscuit sandwiches. The word "espresso" appears in four places. And then at the top, outlined with dots of neon lights in big letters, Biscuit Bar. There are three registers out front, each with a teenager behind it. Lily is the most chipper by far. She's ready to sell.LilyWe're really excited to be here. We've got a couple of great new items. We have the Piggy in a Donut, which won an award, especially for our piggy--Yes, our piggy secret sauce. It's kind of got a kick to it. It's got some chipotle in it. So if you're feeling something a little bit spicier, definitely, that's the way to go. We also have a Bubbly Latte, which is kind of like a hybrid between your--Chris BenderevIt's about 7:45 AM. Some of the people who are allowed in early, fair staff, people here to show livestock, they start lining up at Biscuit Bar, eager for breakfast and coffee. I find Jamie inside the trailer. He's got a buzzed head, goatee, gruff voice, but soft eyes. He's assembling coffee orders alongside one of his new employees.Jamie AdkinsWhat do you need?Customer 3Trying to get me some coffee.Staff 1A small iced espresso.Jamie AdkinsVanilla, and add whipped topping. So it's a small?Staff 1Yeah.Chris BenderevThey're both wearing these hot pink Biscuit Bar t-shirts. Everyone here is. And in this moment, I'm struck by how something as simple as matching t-shirts can create a unifying sense of shared fortune, of teamwork. It's almost beautiful to behold.Jamie AdkinsThe problem is that--Chris BenderevWait, actually, there's some kind of issue with the espresso drink.Jamie AdkinsSee, it looks weak to me.Staff 1That's what she was saying too.Jamie AdkinsWhat is going on here?Chris BenderevThis iced drink looks weird. It tastes weird. Jamie starts inspecting the back side of the large espresso machine.Staff 1See, I've always been intimidated by this thing.Jamie AdkinsSomebody shut this switch off. That's why.Staff 1Oh.Jamie AdkinsIt wasn't brewing because it's not hot. This is never supposed to get shut off, and somebody had shut it off.Staff 2And the two pigs are done.Jamie AdkinsIt's going to probably take five or six minutes. Let's just see.Chris BenderevWhen Jamie says it'll take five or six minutes for the water to reheat, he actually has no idea how long it'll take. A couple espresso drink orders are already waiting, and more are coming in. Five minutes pass. The water still isn't hot. Jamie shows Jennifer.Jamie AdkinsThe problem is that it's not hot, Jennifer. It's going to take five more minutes, probably.Jennifer AdkinsSo we need a vanilla iced espresso?Jamie AdkinsAnd there's fresh grounds in there ready to go, but the water isn't hot enough yet. So somebody shut the switch off on the bottom. I don't know what they was doing, but--Chris BenderevJamie leaves Jennifer to figure out the coffee. Meanwhile, the employees assembling the sandwiches inside the trailer are shouting out the window to the kitchen. They need supplies. Brisket for the brisket sandwich won't be ready for 20 more minutes. And there are other shortages.Staff 1We got sausage gravy?Staff 3Sausage gravy.Jamie AdkinsDo we have more gravy made?JeffNope.Jamie AdkinsOK, well, then we need to be making gravy. Wow.Chris BenderevOr a little later--Staff 1Can we get sausage patties, please?Jamie AdkinsWhat did she want?GrandmaSausage patties. Sausage patties.Jamie AdkinsWe better put some more on. Do you know where they're at?Chris BenderevJamie starts rummaging through the fridge, looking for more individually wrapped sausage patties. He started the day with just 80, and now they're almost out. Jamie does find a huge bag of raw sausage and gets people to start molding that into patties. His brother Jeff starts grilling them. Jamie feels like these handmade patties are a workable solution. Jeff, who is like a shorter version of Jamie with a dash of Joe Pesci mixed in, does not.Jamie AdkinsWe can make them right here.JeffYeah, them don't cook like the other ones do. They're a pain in the fucking dick.Chris BenderevIn case you didn't catch that, Jeff said the handmade patties are a pain in the fucking dick to cook.JeffBecause then you got to check every one of them because they're not the same thickness, not the same shape.Jamie AdkinsIt'll be all right.Chris BenderevJamie does have a secret card he can play in this situation. He phones up Joni, his cousin with the successful food stands, to see if she has extra patties.Jamie AdkinsHello? I think I'm going to run out of pork patties before I can get time to go to the kitchen and get what Josh dropped me. We are busy. We had a few people. Fucking Albert.Chris BenderevAlbert is the guy who was supposed to deliver the milk.Jamie AdkinsGive me that milk.Chris BenderevAnother problem.Jamie AdkinsMust not have brought me whole milk. I'm going to fucking kill him. Told him 12 gallon of whole milk, and he brought me all skim.Chris BenderevThis is a problem. You can't make gravy with skim milk.Jamie AdkinsMotherfucker. OK, bye.Chris BenderevMeanwhile, out in front of the trailer, there's a semicircle of customers waiting for their orders. They all seem pretty calm, including Erika and Kris, two women who are wearing athleisure wear.ErikaWe're waiting.Chris BenderevHas it been a bit of a wait?KrisJust a little bit, but that's OK. They're figuring things out.Chris BenderevCan I ask how long you've been waiting?KrisRight now, we're at eight minutes.Chris BenderevBack inside the big green and pink trailer--Staff 4Hey, we need another three piggies and a hot chick!Chris Benderev--it's very tight in the trailer. And to assemble sandwiches, people are constantly squeezing past each other because the sausage and biscuits and eggs are on one end, and the sauces and dressings and cheese are on the other. Then they drop the finished sandwiches, wrapped in foil, near the front window. But the problem is, there's nothing written on the foil. They all look alike, which is why one of the cashiers sticks his head in and asks me--Kitchen StaffWhat's this? Did you hear what this was?Chris BenderevNo, I have not.AlexIt's probably a regular.Kitchen StaffYeah, that was a regular.Chris BenderevOver and over, the staff have to gently unwrap the corner of a sandwich to check what it is. Of course, there's a simpler solution to this, a way to label the sandwiches. But--Jennifer AdkinsMarker. Where's the marker? Do you have a marker, Brooke?Chris BenderevJennifer, who's in charge of the trailer, cannot find the one permanent marker that they had. Oh, and also, some of the orders aren't showing up on the overhead computer screens inside the trailer. So everyone's resorted to just yelling out orders at each other.AlexI need a regular.Staff 5Regular.Staff 6We need a hot mess.Ben11-07!Staff 6Can we get a confirm on that hot mess?Staff 7Yes, you have to wait.Chris BenderevThings feel so out of control that just 45 minutes after the fair's gates have opened, Jamie calls for reinforcements, his 12-year-old daughter and his 19-year-old stepson, Alex.Jamie AdkinsHello? Where are you at? OK, you need to get to work. I know you're not supposed to start until 10:00, but we are slammed busy. Just get down here as quick as you can. There's people lined up clear to the street. And your mom probably needs you on the inside.Chris BenderevBack out front, I tracked down the customers, Erika and Kris, again. They'd just gotten their food.KrisIt's tasty. It's good, but not worth 35-minute wait.Chris Benderev35 minutes?KrisYes.Chris BenderevAnd what do you think?ErikaIt's very good. Yep. I wouldn't wait again.Chris BenderevThe whole thing's kind of painful to watch. People are requesting refunds. It's obvious this is not how this is supposed to go. I was curious how a food stand at the fair is supposed to work, and I didn't have to go far. A couple stands down is an incredibly successful food vendor that's been around for years.Matt RebarBrad and Harry's cheese curds have been at the Iowa State Fair since somewhere in the mid to early '90s.Chris BenderevMatt Rebar runs three cheese curd stands and one poutine stand here at the Iowa fair. And the way they operate has been refined over decades. And the biggest difference I noticed from Jamie and Jennifer's Biscuit Bar? Simplicity, all emanating from this fact.Matt RebarWe have one item. We have one item. It costs one amount. We know they're in line for cheese curds. We know what the change is. We can see in their wallet and know what bill they're going to grab, and we can already have the change ready by the time that transaction happens.Chris BenderevBiscuit Bar, by contrast, has 11 food items and 16 beverage choices, many with a bunch of different customizations.Matt RebarIt's volume. That's what we're after, is the volume. Quality, but volume.Chris BenderevInside his trailer, it's tightly packed with employees in a smaller space than Biscuit Bar. But somehow, it's more orderly.Matt RebarBut as far as workstations and positions in here, that's another thing. Everybody in there has one job, and they are within one foot of what they need to do. They don't have to take two steps to do anything in there.Chris BenderevReally?Matt RebarWe have enough people where, if you needed to take two steps, we're going to put another person in there to do that for you, just to be efficient as much as possible.Chris BenderevThe trailer was custom-built, so every step of making the food is laid out in perfectly sequential cheese curd assembly stations. Over at the Biscuit Bar, employees make complicated coffee drinks, smoothies, and pour fountain drinks. At Matt's cheese curd stands, his employees don't make drinks at all. Matt sees that as inefficient. Instead--Matt RebarWe've got a self-serve pop. Pop takes a lot of time, so if we can hand them a cup, they can go take their time, fill their ice as much as they want or as little as they want.Chris BenderevOne last note about the simplicity of Matt's cheese curd stands-- paper towels. People need them constantly in a kitchen, and Matt has positioned a roll that hangs horizontally from a bungee cord above the workers. They can grab and tear them off effortlessly without taking up any space. Meanwhile, back at Biscuit Bar--Jamie AdkinsThis stupid fucking thing.Chris Benderev--Jamie had one of those large, black, mechanized paper towel dispensers that you find in public restrooms, the kind you have to wave your hands under. This morning, it was spitting out only a couple inches of paper towel at a time. The whole first morning, it seemed like Biscuit Bar couldn't catch any luck. Then in the early afternoon--(SUBJECT) JENNIFER ADKINS: Are you guys ready to order?Jennifer AdkinsChris Benderev--it finally feels like Biscuit Bar rights the ship.Jennifer AdkinsA piggy? I'll get him a piggy.Chris BenderevEverybody's talking in a more normal volume, the wait times are way shorter, and the kitchen is feeding the sandwich makers what they need when they need it.Jamie AdkinsThere's you some more brisket.Chris BenderevThe lines are shorter now, not exactly 10 or 12 people deep, like during the breakfast rush, but there's still a steady flow of customers. People really like Biscuit Bar. I feel hopeful for them. For the first time, I think maybe they could break even. By the time I catch up with Jennifer again, it's closing time, 10:00 PM. She's at the cash register, is printing out the daily totals.Chris BenderevWhen you print out the totals from the registers, is that the first time you're seeing the numbers?Jennifer AdkinsYeah.Chris BenderevJennifer looks over the receipts, then tucks them away. Her face is hard to read, maybe a little solemn.Chris BenderevCan you tell me, looking at the receipts from the first day, do you have a sense of, oh, at this rate, if we do this for 10 days, we could break even or get close to my goal?Jennifer AdkinsNo. We just have so much money in this stand, and--Chris BenderevReally? Even with this big first day, it feels like--Jennifer AdkinsYeah.Chris BenderevJust then, Jamie wanders over.Jennifer AdkinsHe was asking if we were-- at this rate, if we would break even. [LAUGHS]Jamie AdkinsNo. We got a lot invested in the stand. And my guess, it's two years, three years.Chris Benderev10 days pass. The fair ends, and I check back in with Jamie and Jennifer. They'd both worked from 5:00 in the morning until 11:00 at night on their feet for 11 consecutive days without a break. It was grueling. And the money was way less than they'd hoped for, less than half of what Jamie had predicted. After the food costs and operating expenses, and after the fair took its nearly 20% cut, they were left with about $70,000 profit.$70,000-- good money, but all of it would go towards paying back their original investment, which was, remember, $300,000. At that rate, Jamie and Jennifer will be working for free for four years before they pay off their debts. And after four years, they take home $70,000 every state fair before taxes. A solid chunk of money, for sure. Lots of families would take that deal. But this was still so much less than they talked about earning. Remember, Jamie's estimate would have had them pocketing two or three times that amount.Chris BenderevSo I just wondered, does that math, how does that sit with you? Does that feel worth it to you?Jennifer AdkinsI think so. I mean, look, I'm not really bothered by it now, after the fact.Jamie AdkinsI think it's worth it. It's a lot of work, but it's worth it.Chris BenderevJamie told me he was completely unfazed when he saw the numbers come in.Chris BenderevYou didn't feel anything about, well, I guess we're going to be a little short of kind of half of what I wanted?Jamie AdkinsNo. No.Chris BenderevI think a lot of people would have a hard time adjusting to that reality, or less.Jamie AdkinsI wouldn't.Chris BenderevWait, really? I mean, you're a really blunt guy, Jamie. But on this one thing, I got to say, I don't know if I believe you.Jamie AdkinsYeah, no, you can believe me. I deal with it all the time. My trucking business, a couple of years ago, done right at $12 million in sales, gross sales. And we won't even be $8 million, probably, this year. I've been in business long enough that I know that just because you made that much money yesterday don't mean you're going to make it today.Chris BenderevI didn't appreciate at first just how much Jamie sees opening a business at the fair as being like a trip to the casino. When he predicted that they'd make $300,000 to $350,000 their first summer, that wasn't because he'd done some careful calculations, counting the number of biscuits you could sell each day.It was just a wish. He was going to put his money down on the table, roll the dice, and hope for the best. And even though it'll take years before they pay off Biscuit Bar's debts, Jamie is already encouraging Jennifer to open up her coffee shop this upcoming spring. Jennifer isn't so sure if the finances will work. Jamie, though, he feels lucky.Ira GlassChris Benderev, he's one of the producers of today's episode.Act Three: Limp BiscuitIra GlassAct Four, Last Stand. Saturday night, the part of the park with rides for little kids closes down at 10:00 PM I stopped by there a little before that, wondering if I can talk to Jeremy, the agent of the watergun game.BarryCome up. Look, I got a family special here for you guys. Closing special, guys. If I get four people to play, whoever wins gets a big choice prize.Ira GlassThat hoarse, exhausted-sounding person is Barry, who's doing stock, handling prizes for Jeremy earlier in the day. Now, Jeremy's the one handling prizes, and Barry is on the mic.BarryRight here, are you ready? Have a seat. That's one. I need at least two to start.Ira GlassThere are a few straggler families left, and they are keeping themselves as far as they can from Barry, holding a distance of maybe 35, 40 feet. They look beat, and they are not interested in Barry's shenanigans on the mic. Finally, one woman sits down at the game.BarryI got one in the door. I need at least one more person to start. I see you peeking out there. You can't win it by looking at it, girl. Come on, give it a shot. Show them how it's done.Ira GlassSecond woman pulls up in a motorized wheelchair. Barry pleads with people to sit. And when I ask him what this is about--[CHATTER]BarryWe're $100 short from our goal tonight.Ira GlassJeremy tells me that they have a goal to bring in $10,000 that day for the game.BarryGive it a shot. Look.Ira GlassAnd I want to be clear, this was not management that set this goal. Jeremy did, he said. That's the number he wanted to hit. He and Barry each got a percentage of that $10,000. And they decided on how much they wanted to make for the day. And then they were going to use everything they had to make that number, begging people to sit down.BarryThere you go. I got two in the door. I'm looking for two more. What? I need more than two.Ira GlassBarry ends up running a modified two-person version of the game for a smaller prize and keeps going with more rounds.BarryWho's ready? Who's next?Ira Glass10:00 comes. The rides around us starts shutting down. Ferris wheel lights go off. That feels weird. This gigantic, multi-colored bright thing, suddenly pitch dark. Very tired clumps of people wander past it towards parking lots. But the water gun race is an island of light and noise.BarryCome on. Come on. Last race. Last race of the night. Have a seat, guys. Come on. One more time. We're going to give another big one away, guys. Last race of the night. Last race of the night, guys. Come on up. Give it a shot. One more person.Ira GlassThey finally run their last race four minutes after 10:00.Barry3, 2, 1.Ira GlassFour minutes after this part of the park officially closed.BarryDon't spill. It's neck and neck. It's toe to toe. Go, go, go, go, go. Who's it going to be? Stop, watch, and see. Number![BELL RINGING]Winner, winner, winner. 22, any prize, any size. All right, guys, have a great rest of your night. Thank you all. Appreciate you.Customer 4Whatever.Customer 5I didn't win.Ira GlassThey're done. Sound system is off. They made their goal, they told me. Jeremy said, when 10:00 hit, of course, they had to keep going.Jeremy BuvierWe had a goal. We needed $5 more. All right, we got to flash.BarryYeah, we got to do stuff.Ira GlassGot to flash means they're not done for the night. They have to head over to where the prizes are stored, get some prizes, come back to the game, and put them in place for tomorrow. He said they started to work around 9:00 that morning. It was 10:00 at night. They had another hour's work to go. We kept going, Jeremy said, because we like money.Act Four: Last Stand (Podcast Only)Ira GlassOur program was produced today by Chris Benderev and Ike Sriskandarajah.
