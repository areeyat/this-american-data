This all started with a phone call, a call that eventually led to this episode. So that's where I'm going to start. I was talking to a journalist in Gaza on the phone.Maram HamaidHello?Chana Joffe-WaltHi, this is Chana. Hi.Maram HamaidHow are you?Chana Joffe-WaltThis was back in April. I'd been speaking to people in Gaza for months by then, but nobody where Maram was, in the middle area, Deir Balah. Maram Hamaid, she's a reporter for Al Jazeera English. We were chatting. I was asking some pretty basic questions about what she was experiencing, what she was seeing, what the day had been like. She got interrupted.Maram HamaidIt was a little bit calm day in Deir Balah. You know, like--BaniasWho is it, Mom?Maram HamaidSo Banias is listening. I need to introduce Banias to you.Chana Joffe-WaltHi, Banias.BaniasHi.Chana Joffe-WaltHow are you?BaniasI'm fine, thank you.Chana Joffe-WaltGood.Maram and I kept talking-- or trying to.Chana Joffe-WaltAnd you're in Deir Balah? Are you in Deir Balah?BaniasNow what do I do?Maram HamaidYeah, we are in Deir Balah--BaniasMom--Maram Hamaid--in the central area.Banias--now what do I do?Chana Joffe-WaltIs that where you're from? Is that where your home is, or did you--Maram HamaidUh, no. I'm displaced.Chana Joffe-WaltYeah.Maram HamaidAnd we're living in our relative's home here, with around 80 other family members.Chana Joffe-WaltWow.Banias"Ay-dee"!Chana Joffe-WaltYeah.BaniasIt's "ay-dee," not "ay-tee." Not "ay-tee."Chana Joffe-WaltThat's a lot of people.Maram HamaidYeah. Yeah, yeah. Like a big number--BaniasMom, it's "ay-dee," not "ay-tee."Maram HamaidSo Banias is correcting me regarding the American accent, OK? So she's saying, like, what is it? It's "ay-tee" or "ay-dee"?Banias"Ay-dee"!Maram HamaidOh.Chana Joffe-Walt"Ay-dee." "Ay-dee."Does she correct you a lot?Maram HamaidYeah! A lot, a lot. She speaks English better than me because I started with her from very young.BaniasBack to me.Maram HamaidI'm here around Banias--BaniasBack to me.Maram HamaidBack to me. [LAUGHS] Yeah.Chana Joffe-WaltAnd where--Maram HamaidShe's-- yeah.Chana Joffe-WaltDoes she want to talk?Maram HamaidYeah.BaniasYeah, I'm pretty ready. I'm ready, ready.Chana Joffe-WaltYou're ready, ready. How old are you, Banias?BaniasI'm eight years old.Chana Joffe-WaltYou're eight years old. And where did you learn to speak like an American?BaniasFrom Mama.Chana Joffe-WaltUh-huh. She speaks to you in English?BaniasYeah. Do you hear that? Do you hear that wee-wee-wee?Chana Joffe-WaltI do. Yeah. What is it?Maram HamaidSo Banias is-- [SIGHS] what is it?BaniasIt's the whoosh, whoosh, whoosh. A war plane.Chana Joffe-WaltIt's a warplane. I do hear it, yeah.BaniasI, of course, hear it, because it never ends.Chana Joffe-WaltBanias then takes the phone from her mom-- having told me what they are hearing, begins pointing out what they're seeing, saying, look at this-- as if I can also see, even though we're not on a video call. She says, here we have the window, as you can see. Here's the curtains. There are flowers. We don't have any sofas, just-- Mom, how do you say it?Chana Joffe-WaltMattresses?BaniasJust "may-tresses," as you can see. We sit sometimes on bed, on the ground. Women are covering their heads all the time, as you can see.Maram Hamaid[LAUGHS] She couldn't see. You should tell her.Chana Joffe-WaltYeah, tell me.BaniasOK. Oh, did you see our room?Chana Joffe-WaltNo.BaniasIf you see it, you will-- you will run, run, run, run from this.Chana Joffe-WaltWhy?Maram Hamaid[LAUGHS]BaniasBecause it's so old and dusty.Chana Joffe-WaltMaram told me later she was so surprised at Banias's performance in this call. That was the word she used. Apparently, Banias was marching around with the phone in front of her, telling people, I need the room, please, jumping on the mattress, standing on the table, pointing, saying, here's my brother, Iyas.BaniasThere he is. He's pretty and smart like me.Chana Joffe-WaltGaza is full of kids. About half the population is under 18 years old, and about half of that group is under 10 years old, like Banias. A huge way in which children in this war are different from kids in other war zones is that children in Gaza are not allowed to leave. They're not displaced to some other spot away from the fighting. They're displaced inside Gaza. They're stuck in the violence and stuck with their families, in crowded rooms or tents, doing the things that kids everywhere do, building their inner world, trying to make sense of the world around them. I was calling Maram that day to ask about the situation in Deir Balah, and Banias took the phone and said, no, no, no, don't ask her. Ask me.BaniasBeing in Deir a Balah is boring.Chana Joffe-WaltIt's boring?BaniasReally boring.Chana Joffe-WaltYeah.BaniasNot just-- bored, so bored. I really miss the burgers. And now we are on canned food. We have just the boxes of food, the food boxes. One day-- I want to tell you something.Chana Joffe-WaltTell me.BaniasOne day, when we are sitting in our room talking about something, then boom! A big bomb broke all of the windows, and the home was shaking. And my baby brother, Iyas, has got injured in his head. We have noticed the glass in his head.Chana Joffe-WaltOof. Is he OK, Banias?BaniasYes, now he's all right.Chana Joffe-WaltWe talked for a while and then said goodbye. That was the end of April. And then, in July, I saw Maram's name on my phone.Chana Joffe-WaltHi. Maram? Can you hear me? Hello?BaniasYeah.Chana Joffe-WaltIt was Banias. She wanted to talk, tell me about her day. Then, another day.BaniasHello.Chana Joffe-WaltHi, Banias.BaniasDo you want to talk to me?Chana Joffe-WaltYeah, sure. What are you doing?Through the summer, into the fall, Banias called me, and I called her. Maram, her mother, gave permission for these phone calls, but it was always just Banias on the line, telling me about herself and her life. I wanted to know what it's like to be a kid in this war. And here was this kid who wanted to talk.Banias was a natural narrator of her own life. She was constantly directing my attention. These are my friends. This is my school stationery, as you can see. Do you want to know what we're doing right now? I'll tell you.Unfortunately for me, she also had zero interest in satisfying my journalistic agenda. If I asked Banias a question she was not interested in, she'd yawn dramatically, stage yawn. [YAWNS] It's getting late. I'm so tired. Let's look over here.I had been reading and thinking about what was happening in Gaza all the time, talking to people there. Every call with Banias was something I hadn't heard that was completely different from when adults tell the story.So that is today's episode. We're calling it "The Narrator." We're going to listen to this kid in Gaza, a narrator who does not ask permission to narrate. She takes the phone with a soaring confidence that what she has to tell you is interesting and important, and I agree with her. Stay with us.Part One: Part OneChana Joffe-WaltIt'sThisAmericanLife.My calls with Banias were sporadic. Sometimes we talked once a week. Sometimes a month would go by. Usually, we talked at the end of the day, her time, while she was sitting on a mattress inside the house, fidgeting. There were always lots of people and activity in the background, but Banias never explained much about who was there or what they were doing. She told me about what she was doing, what she wanted me to know and sometimes see.BaniasI prefer a video call.[BEEPING]Chana Joffe-WaltLet me try.BaniasOK.Chana Joffe-WaltHi.BaniasThis is my complete look.Chana Joffe-WaltThat's a good look.She's in a pink shirt that says "Dream." Huge eyes, dark hair, and pigtails with two loose curls very purposefully framing her face.Chana Joffe-WaltAnd you have earrings. I didn't know you had earrings.BaniasOh, yeah, I do have earrings. And this is my blue shorts.Chana Joffe-WaltYeah.BaniasAnd this, this is my head accessory for today. It has rhinestones.Chana Joffe-WaltUh-huh. Purple, furry with rhinestones.BaniasYeah, it's beautiful.Chana Joffe-WaltWhen Banias and I first started talking on the phone, my questions were pretty basic. What do you do all day? She was in a house with 80 people, which is unusual in Gaza right now to live in a house. Most people are in tents or schools or other temporary shelters. Banias and her mom, dad, and baby brother were on the ground floor of this house, sharing that floor with about 20 relatives. There was one bedroom.She slept on a mattress on the floor, alongside her parents, brother, grandpa, uncle, and aunt. Everyone else slept in the living area. If Banias wanted any time in the tiny bathroom, she got up early in the morning. Then she ate breakfast. And then what?BaniasToday we play school games.Chana Joffe-WaltWhat does that mean?BaniasWe're pretending that we're in the school. I was a student. And one of my friends was the teacher.Chana Joffe-WaltWhat classes were you taking?BaniasMath class.Chana Joffe-WaltOK. And did you write actual math, or is it just pretend?BaniasIt was actual, the plus and the minus and the equal. It was actual. But it was in a game, not real.Chana Joffe-WaltAt this point, July, Banias had not been in an actual class in an actual school building for nine months. But she played school every day with three other girls, two younger and one older. There were other kids in the building, but everyone else was just OK, or a boy, or a baby.When aid organizations go into other war zones, one of the first things they do for kids is set up schools, because children need a sense of routine and a sense that life is moving forward toward a future. There's no safe place in Gaza to set up schools like that, so Banias and her friends in the building created that for themselves. They played school for hours. There were lectures. There were assignments. There were exams.Chana Joffe-WaltWho is usually in charge of what you're going to do that day?BaniasThe girl that's older than me. Her name is Dana.Chana Joffe-WaltHow old is Dana?BaniasShe is 12 years old. And she has an iPad.Chana Joffe-WaltDana is generous with her iPad. So this is another part of Banias's day-- games on the iPad. When the war started, her mother's screen time rules went out the window. But also, Israel cut off electricity to Gaza. There's just generators and solar panels, so screen time is limited anyway.BaniasAnd today, we played a cafe game.Chana Joffe-WaltOh, a cafe? That's new.BaniasI was the chef. Yeah. And one of my friends was the customer. I cooked some salad and some pancake.Chana Joffe-WaltSay it one more time?BaniasI cooked salad and pancake. And I made some hamburgers and some pizza.Chana Joffe-WaltBanias was re-enacting her old life, where she had teachers and exams and went out to cafes. There was one they used to go to every Saturday.BaniasYeah, it was really close. It was just in the next street in our house.Chana Joffe-WaltOK. Did they make salad and pancakes?BaniasNo, but I used to order some noodles and some hot chocolate.Chana Joffe-WaltMm-hmm. What did you eat in real life today?BaniasToday we have eaten some beans, some white beans.Chana Joffe-WaltDo you ever get to eat pancakes or noodles or burgers?BaniasI hate pancakes and noodles.Chana Joffe-WaltYou do?BaniasYes.Chana Joffe-WaltOh, wow.BaniasDo you believe somebody hates these things?Chana Joffe-WaltNo.BaniasI do.Chana Joffe-WaltThey're so good.BaniasBut I hate them.Chana Joffe-WaltI was never sure what motivated Banias to want to talk to me. She seemed to like telling me about her day, practicing her English. She had an ongoing fascination with the time difference between us. She always wanted to check in on that.BaniasYou're at morning or at night?Chana Joffe-WaltIt's the afternoon. It's just--BaniasAfternoon?Chana Joffe-WaltMm-hmm.BaniasWe're in the middle of the night.Chana Joffe-WaltShe'd call when she felt annoyed that Dana got to be the teacher that day yet again.BaniasI am bored of being the student every day. I'm the oldest. I should be the teacher. Oof!Chana Joffe-WaltAnd she'd call when she was bored. She'd call because I was an adult who would pay attention to her. Banias had to create activity-- interest-- out of such little material. Sometimes I got the impression I was there to help with that. Like, one night she was on the phone with me, and another phone rang. And like a character in a play, she went, oh, look, the phone is ringing.[PHONE RINGING]BaniasOh, my God. Who's ringing the phone? Get away. Get lost.Chana Joffe-Walt[LAUGHS]BaniasWe have to sleep.Chana Joffe-WaltYou're pretty funny, Banias.BaniasYes, I'm funny. Dana always say for me that I'm a bit funny.Chana Joffe-WaltReally?BaniasFunny bunny.Chana Joffe-WaltMm-hmm. You are funny.BaniasYes. I'm a funny bunny.Chana Joffe-WaltSo Banias had her own reasons to call me. When I called her, it was for different reasons. I'd call her because I'd read about a bombing campaign or fighting near where she was. Was she OK? And what was she thinking about all the violence around her? What is this like for an eight-year-old?In the middle of the summer, there was a series of intense airstrikes near Banias. I was curious if she'd heard them or seen them, but I also wanted to follow her lead and what she wanted to talk about.Chana Joffe-WaltDo you have some time to talk?BaniasOh, yes, of course. I'm available.Chana Joffe-WaltGreat.BaniasI'm actually good.Chana Joffe-WaltYeah?BaniasDoing good. Last days, we have heard a bit of bombing around us.Chana Joffe-WaltUh-huh. Yeah, I've been reading in the news that there's been a lot of bombing.BaniasYeah, I do know. It was loud.Chana Joffe-WaltIs it scary?BaniasNo. For me, no. Me and my friends, we were playing hide-and-seek. We don't ever get bored of it. It's our favorite game. When we are playing, some strange things happens with us. I will tell you then.Chana Joffe-WaltOK, I thought. Here it is. She's about to tell me something big about what it's like to be a kid playing hide-and-seek with bombs going off nearby. Banias told me, so we were playing, and we ran to the backyard.BaniasWhen we run to the backyard, we see some insects in the ground.Chana Joffe-WaltMm-hmm.BaniasWe said, we see some insects on the ground. And me and the kids, we watched it.Chana Joffe-WaltThat's it. That's her whole story. The strange thing that happened when they ran outside is they saw insects, a kind of insect they'd never seen before. Not the bombing-- bugs.Children are not known for their sense of scale or the longevity of their attention. And maybe it wasn't surprising that pretty much every time I asked about the war, Banias didn't really want to engage. She didn't exactly ignore me, but it didn't seem to be the main thing she was thinking about.Like, when an airstrike broke the windows in her house, she wanted to tell me about a prank she played on Dana. In mid-August, when ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas seemed to be unraveling yet again, and all the adults I was talking to in Gaza were deeply dispirited, here was Banias.BaniasI think there will be a ceasefire soon.Chana Joffe-WaltYou do? Why do you think that?BaniasBecause it's really close to end.Chana Joffe-WaltWhy? Why do you say-- what gives you that idea?BaniasMom and Dad tell me. [YAWNS]Chana Joffe-WaltI heard that yawn-- noting it. Discussion of the war-- over. There was one moment when Banias was forced to engage. She couldn't avoid it. Banias's family had been sheltering in Deir Balah for almost a year, when, suddenly, at the end of August, they got an evacuation order. Israel posted a map on social media designating certain blocks in Deir Balah unsafe.And I saw that Maram, Banias's mother, had written something for Al Jazeera about the order. I had hardly spoken to Maram for months, but I had followed her reporting on bombings and food shortages. This article, though, was personal. She wrote about her confusion about what to do next. "I've never felt so worthless as a human being," she wrote."A single Facebook post from an Israeli military spokesperson can upend our lives in an instant. Have you ever felt like a toy being played with left and right, east and west, pushed from one place to another, south to Khan Younis, out of Rafah, back to Khan Younis, then to Nuseirat, only to be driven out again? People are literally running through the streets like mad, clutching what little they have left. We have nothing left. Our hearts are broken, and our minds are frayed.I look around at the few possessions I've managed to gather over the past 10 months-- a stove, cups, plates, pots, winter clothes, summer clothes, mattresses, blankets, batteries, light bulbs, big bottles of drinking water, tubs to wash clothes in. If I leave everything, there's no way to replace it. There are no markets, no supplies, no money to spare. We're running and running aimlessly. People screaming, suffering, and dying while the world watches," end quote. And then my phone rang.Chana Joffe-WaltHello?BaniasHello?Chana Joffe-WaltHi, Banias.BaniasYeah.Chana Joffe-WaltDo you want to talk?BaniasUh, OK. Today, we have done a new thing.Chana Joffe-WaltWhat'd you do?BaniasWe drawed some pictures. I imagined that there's a garden, that there's some people walking inside it.[CHILD CRYING]Stop crying. Go in the bedroom.Chana Joffe-WaltOK.BaniasSo let's continue.Chana Joffe-WaltOK.BaniasOh, my friends were with me, too, drawing. And one of my friends have drawed a plane.Chana Joffe-WaltLike a war plane or a plane you travel in?BaniasUh, traveling.Chana Joffe-WaltOK. Do you ever draw anything about the war?BaniasNo, nothing at all.Chana Joffe-WaltWhy not?BaniasBecause-- I really can't.Chana Joffe-WaltWhy?BaniasI feel mad.Chana Joffe-WaltUh-huh.BaniasI feel mad of this things. I can draw them. But I don't like a war plane, a helicopter, and rockets. I don't like that. There's lots of things here I feel mad from it. My friends always make me mad from things. Sometimes I don't want anybody to enter this room. Get out. Mom! OK.Maram HamaidI'm sorry.BaniasOK, let's continue.Chana Joffe-WaltOK.BaniasI was saying they always attack me.Chana Joffe-WaltYour friends?BaniasYeah.Chana Joffe-WaltI was eager to ask Banias about the news of the evacuation, but what she wanted to talk about was a fight she had that day with another kid in the building, a girl. Banias calls her "the girl with the bad personality." That girl told Banias today that one of her pictures was no good.BaniasShe have a really bad personality. I said for her, are you looking for a fight, in our language.Chana Joffe-WaltAnd what did she say?BaniasYes, I am.Chana Joffe-Walt[LAUGHS]BaniasAnd we fighted all day. She's the most bad friend.Chana Joffe-WaltDid she not know about the evacuation order? She must, right? I didn't want to scare her.Chana Joffe-WaltBanias, I saw your mom wrote about people leaving Deir Balah.BaniasYes.Chana Joffe-WaltHave you--BaniasBut we will go to Al-Zawayda, to our relatives.Chana Joffe-WaltWhat do you think about that?BaniasI think it was a good idea. We're packing our clothes and our-- wait for a minute. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Oh, and we're packing also our mattresses and our money.Chana Joffe-WaltWhere will you sleep if you pack your mattress?BaniasUm, in the tent. Our relatives live in a home. But we will make a camp next to them.Chana Joffe-WaltOK. Have you ever lived in a tent?BaniasNo.Chana Joffe-WaltAre you--BaniasBut I want to try. I think it will be something creative.Chana Joffe-WaltAre you scared to move, to leave your friends or to leave your house?BaniasI'm ready to leave them.Chana Joffe-WaltYou are? [CHUCKLES]BaniasI'm not ready for more fights. I want to leave them. Today, I told one of my friends that I will leave. I've told everybody.Chana Joffe-WaltIs that sad?BaniasIt was drama.Chana Joffe-WaltWhy?BaniasBecause she is a drama girl. Don't leave. That's everything.Chana Joffe-WaltUh-huh.BaniasDon't leave this house. We want more fights.Chana Joffe-WaltBanias was ready to leave because it meant she could get away from the girl with the bad personality. Almost a million kids in Gaza have made a move like this since Israel invaded, many of them multiple times. So it was interesting to hear how a child was thinking about it.Banias was ready to flee the home she'd lived in for 10 months at that point, to move into a tent because she got into a fight with an annoying girl that day, because that is what just happened-- and because Banias is eight. She told me her friend Dana is leaving, too.BaniasShe is going to Al Mawasi. But me, I will go to Zawayda, me and my family. Yeah, our relatives are there. When the Israeli army tell us to move, we'll move to Al Zawayda.Chana Joffe-WaltYou're not scared?Banias[YAWNS] No.Chana Joffe-WaltOK.Maram Hamaid[INAUDIBLE] crying and he was praying.BaniasMom, let that a secret!Maram HamaidNo, it's not a secret. You have to express yourself.BaniasI'm fine, I'm fine.Chana Joffe-WaltWhat does your mom think is a secret?BaniasUh-- a family secret. No. No. I will not give you the mobile. I want to talk to her myself. No, [INAUDIBLE]. No, no.Maram HamaidIs that Chana?Chana Joffe-WaltHi.Maram HamaidHi. How are you?Chana Joffe-WaltGood.BaniasNo, no! Let that away! Let that away! Let that away!Maram HamaidI was just--BaniasNo, no! Let that away.Maram Hamaid--I just heard her--BaniasPlease, please!Maram Hamaid--saying that--BaniasNot here!Chana Joffe-WaltYour--Maram HamaidSo Banias was crying.BaniasNo! Can you keep that away?Maram HamaidIt's normal.BaniasIt's a secret. I don't want--Maram HamaidThis is normal.BaniasI don't want to let anybody know that I was-- I wasn't!Maram HamaidNo.BaniasNo, I was--Maram HamaidYou were crying.Banias--I wasn't!Maram HamaidSo she was afraid. She was nervous. And she went into--BaniasI was not afraid!Maram Hamaid--a circle--BaniasI was not nervous!Maram Hamaid--of feeling sad and feeling nervous--Banias[INAUDIBLE] Keep that away!Maram Hamaid--very afraid of what is going on. And I just surprisingly heard her saying that I'm not.BaniasLet that away!Maram HamaidI didn't feel afraid.BaniasLet that away!Chana Joffe-WaltWhy? Why does she not want to talk about that?Maram HamaidAnd she's now saying that it's a secret. Like, she doesn't want to recall some horrific memories for her, or like she got over the feeling of being afraid.Chana Joffe-WaltWhen did she find out you were evacuating?Maram HamaidExcuse me?BaniasI didn't cry!Maram Hamaid[CHUCKLES]BaniasI didn't cry!Maram HamaidHallas, she believes you. She believes you. She believes you. I know. Like, you're a brave girl. Like, you can get over anything. But I'm telling you, Banias. It's not a shame. It's not a shameful thing to feel afraid that you're scared and you're afraid of something like this. Yeah? So--BaniasSo--Maram Hamaid--right? It's normal. You should be scared. Yeah, this is very normal.BaniasI was not--Maram HamaidAnd do what I can.Banias--scared!Maram HamaidOK, Mama, you are hallas. You are afraid to say what you want. But I want to just to clarify this point. [LAUGHS] You were crying like crazy upon hearing the news. And I'm telling her, like I totally understand her feelings.Chana Joffe-WaltWhen did that happen, Maram? When did you tell her?Maram HamaidIt's just less than two hours ago.Chana Joffe-WaltOh, wow, just recently. OK. OK.Maram HamaidYeah, yeah, yeah. Very recent, you know? Very recent. We got the news suddenly. [LAUGHS] I was really laughing when I heard her trying to show a perfectionist reaction and so positive. She was very positive.But it was totally the opposite, you know? Just, like, two hours, less than two hours, she was hiding behind the curtain, crying and like crazy. And she continued this cycle. And then we find it's really hard.Chana Joffe-WaltI almost couldn't bear hearing this. Banias's visceral, immediate panic was so uncomfortable, hearing her mother pierce the carefully constructed artifice she'd presented to me. And it was disorienting. It made me think of all the things I didn't know.Chana Joffe-WaltDoes she want to talk again?Maram HamaidYeah, yeah. She's here. She's here.Chana Joffe-WaltOK.Maram Hamaid[INAUDIBLE] come and [INAUDIBLE]BaniasHello?Chana Joffe-WaltHi, Banias.BaniasHi.Chana Joffe-WaltHi. How come you didn't want me to know that you were upset?BaniasI'm not upset.Chana Joffe-WaltYou're not upset. Do you want to talk about that or no?BaniasNot yet.Chana Joffe-WaltWhat?BaniasNot yet.Chana Joffe-WaltIs there anything else you want to tell me about how you're doing?BaniasI'm already so sleepy.Chana Joffe-WaltYeah, it's late. So I hope you have an easy night, Banias.BaniasI hope so.Chana Joffe-WaltAn incomplete list of things Banias does not have control over-- can she go home? No. Is there food? Not enough. Is there school? No. Is there safety here? No. Banias lives in what has become the most dangerous place in the world to be a child.Disease in Gaza is widespread. Children face acute malnutrition. Kids are getting horrible skin infections. Polio has reappeared in a 10-month-old baby. Children are losing their limbs, their parents, and they are being killed, constantly. More than 13,000 children have been killed so far, including at least 710 babies, some of them born and then killed since the war began.Maram told me Banias has seen dead children. She's seen their small bodies wrapped in white cloth by the hospital. I asked Maram later, what do you think Banias gets out of talking to me? She told me, you're a bubble for her.Every time you call, she treats it like an important meeting, tries to find a private space away from all of us. Everyone around Banias is in the midst of this chaos, she said. You're not here. You're not experiencing any of this.Banias was telling me a version of life where she has ultimate authority, where she gets to be the narrator. Who doesn't want that? I was coming to her to understand the war, but she was coming to me to not talk about the war, until one day, she did. That's coming up from Chicago Public Radio, when our program continues.Part Two: Part TwoChana Joffe-WaltIt'sThisAmericanLife.I'm Chana Joffe-Walt, sitting in for Ira Glass. Our show today, "The Narrator," an eight-year-old in Gaza, tells us about her life in the middle of a war.This war started in 2023. Hamas attacked Israel, killed about 1,200 people, and took 251 people hostage. Since then, Israel has launched a 14-month ground invasion and bombing campaign in Gaza. More than 44,000 Palestinians have been killed, and more than 13,000 of those dead are children.Banias and her family never moved into a tent. After the Israeli army issued that evacuation order for Deir Balah, her parents agonized over when and if they should flee for days. The dangers of moving into a tent could be worse than tanks outside their house. They decided to stay put. It was early October. The family was coming up on a year of war and displacement, and Banias had an announcement.BaniasThe war stopped. The war stopped. Do you know, the war stopped?Chana Joffe-WaltYesterday, there was no bombing or fighting?BaniasNo. Ever, never. The war stopped.Chana Joffe-WaltWhat are you talking about?BaniasBecause our house was bombed.Chana Joffe-WaltYour house was bombed?BaniasYeah. Just kidding.Chana Joffe-Walt[LAUGHS]BaniasBut--Chana Joffe-WaltWhat are you doing to me, Banias?BaniasBut there was good news yesterday. Yesterday, tonight, it was-- wee! We had a party. There was very, very good news.Chana Joffe-WaltWhat was the good news?BaniasOh. Um-- we have killed all of them.Chana Joffe-WaltWhat do you mean? Who did you kill all of?BaniasNot all of them-- thousands and thousands and thousands of them! But I can't remember who.Chana Joffe-WaltYou're talking about the Israelis?BaniasYes, yes. Thousands and thousands. We killed thousands, thousands, thousands.Chana Joffe-WaltI realized as we were talking, this was October 2. The day before, Iran had launched 180 missiles at Israel.Chana Joffe-WaltThat was--BaniasYes, that was yesterday. Yesterday, we had a party for that. We bring coffee, make juice. Oh! Kay-yef-nah.Chana Joffe-WaltKay-yef-nah?BaniasYes.Chana Joffe-WaltWhat's "kay-yef-nah" mean?BaniasThat means "we had a good time" in Arabic.Chana Joffe-WaltBanias, you're talking about the missiles yesterday to the Israelis?BaniasYes.Chana Joffe-WaltHow did you feel about that?BaniasIt was-- whoa! It was very good. [NON-ENGLISH]Chana Joffe-WaltThis threw me, hearing Banias talk about killing Israelis. No Israelis were killed from these missiles. One Palestinian man was, near Jericho. It's one of those empty truisms about war, that kids in a war learn to hate the other side, a true thing about war that also can feel a little abstract.But here it was, showing up, randomly folded into the rest of Banias's narration to her playing with me, messing with me, that the home she was sheltering in was bombed-- which it could have been, but wasn't. I asked Maram if I could talk with her about this day. I told her what Banias had told me.Chana Joffe-WaltWhat was happening that day?Maram HamaidYeah, actually, on that day, it was a huge surprise, actually. Suddenly, we were at home, and we heard the sounds of cheer and people around us cheering and chanting. The internet was cut.And I thought from the first instance that there was a ceasefire or something like this. The war ended, you know? So people around us started to say that Iran is bombing Israel right now. And we could see the lights of the missiles being sent to Israel, in the sky. And people around us are just cheering and celebrating and clapping.I was in emotion. I was very emotional. I really cried. I felt like, oh, my God, really? Someone who's trying just to stop Israel, and to say that by the missiles and by the rockets, the same language that Israel understands and uses in Gaza throughout the years.Chana Joffe-WaltWere you celebrating? Were you guys celebrating?Maram HamaidI didn't. We were just like excited. We stayed home because maybe missiles could drop by mistake on us. We were just trying to follow up the news.Chana Joffe-WaltMaram told me she does not tell Banias to hate Israel or celebrate when Israel is attacked. Banias's dad, she says, also doesn't do this. But Maram was not surprised to hear Banias was saying this. She remembers feeling the same way when she was a kid growing up in Gaza.Maram was 10 years old when she first experienced Israeli bombing after the Second Intifada broke out. She remembers crying when she saw her first dead body and collapsing when she saw footage of a 12-year-old Palestinian kid, Mohammed al-Durrah, killed while hiding next to his father. Banias was born in 2016. Her first war was when she was four years old.Maram HamaidI totally understand that she herself, as a Palestinian kid, she views Israel as an enemy, an enemy that bombs us, that kills us, that targets us.Chana Joffe-WaltThere's something I've been thinking about when it comes to kids in wars, but kids in Gaza in particular. It's something a psychologist told me, Dr. Iman Farajallah, who studies the effect of war and occupation on Palestinian kids. She told me it really gets under her skin when people at the UN or healthcare professionals or whatever say kids in Gaza are suffering from PTSD.Post-traumatic stress means the traumatic event is over. For kids in Gaza, the trauma is continuous. There is no post. There's no opportunity for recovery. Instead, there is just coping. Dr. Farajallah says, you'll see kids cope in all different ways. Some kids act out. Some can't leave their parents' side. Other kids get obsessed with soccer or drawing. Or children try to shape their world in other ways.For instance, Maram told me when Banias was six years old, there was an Israeli military operation in Gaza, lots of fighting. And Banias was sitting on the window, watching ambulances rush people to the hospital, blowing bubbles out the window. Maram asked her, what are you doing? And Banias said, I'm trying to change the mood.Maram HamaidI know Banias. She is an optimistic one. She's someone who's positive. And she doesn't even want to share her negative thoughts with others--BaniasHello?Maram Hamaid--even when she's fearful. Like--BaniasHello?Maram HamaidThis is my space, Banias. Please go away.BaniasNo!Maram HamaidI'm talking. She's someone who loves life and loves to play and loves to--Chana Joffe-WaltIt's almost like she's willing it. She's willing-- She's using all of her force to will life into being easier than it is.Maram HamaidYeah. Yeah. And she always trying to change the mood for the people to make them feel optimistic.BaniasHi.Chana Joffe-WaltHi, Banias.BaniasHi. Hi, Chana. How are you?Chana Joffe-WaltThat was basically the end of my conversation with Maram. As she did the first time around, Banias decided it was time for us to move on. My calls with Banias have grown more infrequent. The last time she called, I was in my office heading into a meeting. I was going to just say a quick hello, make sure she was OK.BaniasHello?Chana Joffe-WaltHi, Banias. How are you?[BEEPING]BaniasHi.Chana Joffe-WaltAre you calling me on video?BaniasYes, I am.Chana Joffe-WaltOK, hang on. Let's see.BaniasHi.Chana Joffe-WaltOh, there you are. There you are. Hi.BaniasHi. I'm watching a film. Do you want to see? It's calledHomeAlone.Chana Joffe-Walt[CHUCKLES]BaniasDo you know?Chana Joffe-WaltI do.BaniasI love it. Would you like to watch with me? Would you like to watch?Chana Joffe-WaltI paused, looked at my watch, saw my coworkers heading to the meeting room, and decided to go ahead with her agenda.BaniasOh, let's see it together.Chana Joffe-WaltOK, for a few minutes.BaniasOh. Oh, my God. I want to cover myself. It's so cold here. Oh. OK. Oh, my God. I'm here.Chana Joffe-WaltOK.She's under the covers with her phone and her laptop in purple pajamas. She's sitting on her mattress on the floor. And she's pointing the phone at her screen, so we can watch together.BaniasI'm covering myself in the tent.Chana Joffe-Walt[CHUCKLES]BaniasOh. Here. Do you see?Chana Joffe-WaltYeah, I can see.BaniasOh!ManHey! Shoplifter!BaniasOh, my God! Oi!Chana Joffe-WaltOf course, Banias is a vocal movie watcher.BaniasWho is he?Chana Joffe-WaltShe has a running commentary on the characters, repeats English words that are new to her, explains the movie.BaniasHe's now skating on the ice. They leave him alone. But he's happy, happy.Chana Joffe-WaltWould you be happy if that happened?BaniasYes! I'm free!Chana Joffe-WaltYou would?BaniasI will shout in the home, I'm free! I'm free!Chana Joffe-Walt[LAUGHS]ManWe're the Wet Bandits. You're sick. You know that? Really silly!BaniasReally silly.ManThat's it! That's a sick thing to say!Chana Joffe-WaltMcCaulley Caulkin-- who I'd forgotten is also eight years old in this movie-- is walking home, crosses a driveway, just as the two burglars, Joe Pesci and the other guy, pull out in their van, screech to a halt, and McCaulley Caulkin does his blonde surprise face.ManHey, watch out![TIRES SQUEALING][SCREAMING]Chana Joffe-Walt[LAUGHS]BaniasOh. [GIGGLES] That's so funny.Man 1Hey, hey! You gotta watch out for traffic, son, you know?KevinSorry.Man 2Santa don't visit the funeral home, little buddy.Man 1OK, OK. Merry Christmas.BaniasI do like the Christmas design.Chana Joffe-WaltMm-hmm.BaniasI really like this movie. And when they travel to New York-- oh, where do you live?Chana Joffe-WaltI live in New York. That's where I live.BaniasIn the New York?Chana Joffe-WaltMm-hmm.BaniasYes. Kevin's family travels there last time. You live in New York?Chana Joffe-WaltMm-hmm, I do.BaniasOh, I want to tell you something. What about this statue that you have?Chana Joffe-WaltThe Statue of Liberty?BaniasYes! It's in New York.Chana Joffe-WaltYeah.BaniasYou see it? I want to see it!Chana Joffe-WaltOh, yeah. I don't see it right now, but I see it-- I see it pretty often.BaniasWhen you are out of your house, you see it?Chana Joffe-WaltYeah, when I go--BaniasOh, yeah.Chana Joffe-Walt--when I go to work, sometimes I can see it.BaniasOh, I want to go to work with you to see it. I'd love to.Chana Joffe-WaltBanias, the houses there in that part of the movie, does it look anything like Gaza?BaniasNo.Chana Joffe-WaltHow is it different?BaniasNo. Gaza is more beautiful.Chana Joffe-WaltEven now?BaniasYes, even now, and every time.Chana Joffe-WaltTwo days earlier, Israeli airstrikes hit Al Aqsa Hospital in Deir Balah, right near Banias's apartment. The hospital was surrounded by tents filled with displaced people sleeping. The airstrikes caused a fire that ripped through those tents. I'd seen Maram sharing images and videos of people sleeping in the tents burned alive.I wondered if Banias had seen those images, but I didn't ask. Instead, we watched this Christmas movie. We watched Kevin trick the burglars into thinking his family is home by staging a fake party in his house.BaniasOh, my. Oh, my God. What's that?Chana Joffe-WaltAny war is a series of plot points. Even in an ongoing war, a never-ending and no-longer-new war, we track its progress by the worst moments. I kept calling Banias with this expectation, waiting for the story of the war as I was understanding it, to somehow intersect with her life as she was experiencing it.I kept imagining, dreading, that one of those moments will break through, that something bad will happen to Banias. One of those horrible plot points will become her plot point.But something bad is happening to Banias. This is the plot point for her. She's sitting under the covers with no electricity, no heat, winter approaching. Banias has not been in school for over a year. She has no home. She has a cough, and there is no medicine.Her friends have scattered. Some of them are dead. Her relatives are all over. Some of them are dead. She's eating canned beans, instead of burgers. She's finding glass in her brother's head. This is her life. This is the story she has to narrate.BaniasDo you want to see where he will go? I don't know exactly where he will go.Chana Joffe-WaltHe's hiding.BaniasHe's hiding.Chana Joffe-WaltOK, Banias, I'm going to go.BaniasOh? Do you want to leave? I want to continue this movie and then go to sleep.Chana Joffe-WaltOK, sleep well. I'll talk to you soon.BaniasWhere are you? Are you still here?Chana Joffe-WaltI'm here.BaniasHello? Hello?Chana Joffe-WaltI'm here.BaniasAre you still here?Chana Joffe-WaltYes, I am.We have a couple minutes left in this episode, and I have a small update. Recently, Banias's family moved-- not far-- an apartment a couple miles from Deir Balah, where they've been staying. The new place is less crowded. There's more privacy for her family. It has trees outside and a refrigerator-- that doesn't work, but still. The apartment is quiet, temporary.And it's not home. Banias knows she can't go home to the north of Gaza, where she's from. She knows her home was destroyed. She's seen pictures of her neighborhood exploded, on fire. And she's seen video of the empty space where her house was, the small mountains of rubble.The gray couch with yellow cushions that she sat on after school, the chandelier her mother chose, the mirror by the door, the teacups and trays filled with treats, her new reimagined big girl bedroom with an Elsa bedspread, her desk, the pink moon they hung on the ceiling-- all of that is somewhere in that pile of rubble. All of that is there in the north of Gaza, their life.But the north of Gaza has been transformed. There were about a million people living in northern Gaza when the war started, over 270,000 homes. Everyone was told to leave, to go south. Most people did. And now those people are separated from the north of Gaza by a wide militarized zone that they cannot cross.Israel has been building and fortifying this military zone for the last few months. It cuts right across Gaza, splits Gaza in two, completely separating the north of Gaza, where Banias is from, from the south of Gaza, where she's been displaced to. This military zone is called the Netzarim Corridor. It has a constant military presence, and it's big, around 20 square miles. It takes up more than 12% of the entire territory of Gaza.In order to build it, Israel cleared out a wide stretch of land, demolished hundreds of buildings, from the Israeli border all the way to the ocean. And in that space, Israel installed checkpoints and paved roads and flags and water lines and cell phone towers. It looks like something you'd put in place if you're planning to stay a while.A former chief of staff of the Israeli military has called the emptying out of the north of Gaza an ethnic cleansing. He said, quote, "the land is being cleared of Arabs." Human Rights Watch, Oxfam, Amnesty International have all called what is happening in Gaza an ethnic cleansing, or a genocide.Israel denies this, and the Israeli military sent me a statement calling the charge of ethnic cleansing entirely baseless. It says it's working to dismantle Hamas's military infrastructure and is adhering to its obligations under international law.The people who remained in the north and never left are under siege, with increasingly limited food and medical care. The UN says children are, quote, "as ever, the first and most to suffer."So this latest move for Banias's parents, it feels like a new phase. It's a move from "I can't believe it's gone on this long" to "this is going to keep going on." For Banias, it's more of the same, more temporary, more displacement, displacement that looks pretty likely to last most, if not all, of her childhood.CreditsChana Joffe-WaltToday's episode was produced by Valerie Kipnis and edited by Laura Starecheski.

Ira will be back next week with more stories ofThisAmericanLife.Chana Joffe-WaltSo this whole episode of the show is all conversations with you. And--BaniasOK! That's great. I will be the star of Gaza.Chana Joffe-Walt[LAUGHS]BaniasI'll be a star. I'll be a star. By the way, the mushroom, too, wants to be the mushroom star of Gaza. Mushroom is joining us in the conversation.Chana Joffe-WaltHi, mushroom.BaniasHi, Chana. I'm joining you to the conversation--Chana Joffe-WaltDo you want--Banias--to be the mushroom star in Gaza.,Prologue: PrologueChana Joffe-WaltFrom WBEZ Chicago, it'sThisAmericanLife.I'm Chana Joffe-Walt, sitting in for Ira Glass. This all started with a phone call, a call that eventually led to this episode. So that's where I'm going to start. I was talking to a journalist in Gaza on the phone.Maram HamaidHello?Chana Joffe-WaltHi, this is Chana. Hi.Maram HamaidHow are you?Chana Joffe-WaltThis was back in April. I'd been speaking to people in Gaza for months by then, but nobody where Maram was, in the middle area, Deir Balah. Maram Hamaid, she's a reporter for Al Jazeera English. We were chatting. I was asking some pretty basic questions about what she was experiencing, what she was seeing, what the day had been like. She got interrupted.Maram HamaidIt was a little bit calm day in Deir Balah. You know, like--BaniasWho is it, Mom?Maram HamaidSo Banias is listening. I need to introduce Banias to you.Chana Joffe-WaltHi, Banias.BaniasHi.Chana Joffe-WaltHow are you?BaniasI'm fine, thank you.Chana Joffe-WaltGood.Maram and I kept talking-- or trying to.Chana Joffe-WaltAnd you're in Deir Balah? Are you in Deir Balah?BaniasNow what do I do?Maram HamaidYeah, we are in Deir Balah--BaniasMom--Maram Hamaid--in the central area.Banias--now what do I do?Chana Joffe-WaltIs that where you're from? Is that where your home is, or did you--Maram HamaidUh, no. I'm displaced.Chana Joffe-WaltYeah.Maram HamaidAnd we're living in our relative's home here, with around 80 other family members.Chana Joffe-WaltWow.Banias"Ay-dee"!Chana Joffe-WaltYeah.BaniasIt's "ay-dee," not "ay-tee." Not "ay-tee."Chana Joffe-WaltThat's a lot of people.Maram HamaidYeah. Yeah, yeah. Like a big number--BaniasMom, it's "ay-dee," not "ay-tee."Maram HamaidSo Banias is correcting me regarding the American accent, OK? So she's saying, like, what is it? It's "ay-tee" or "ay-dee"?Banias"Ay-dee"!Maram HamaidOh.Chana Joffe-Walt"Ay-dee." "Ay-dee."Does she correct you a lot?Maram HamaidYeah! A lot, a lot. She speaks English better than me because I started with her from very young.BaniasBack to me.Maram HamaidI'm here around Banias--BaniasBack to me.Maram HamaidBack to me. [LAUGHS] Yeah.Chana Joffe-WaltAnd where--Maram HamaidShe's-- yeah.Chana Joffe-WaltDoes she want to talk?Maram HamaidYeah.BaniasYeah, I'm pretty ready. I'm ready, ready.Chana Joffe-WaltYou're ready, ready. How old are you, Banias?BaniasI'm eight years old.Chana Joffe-WaltYou're eight years old. And where did you learn to speak like an American?BaniasFrom Mama.Chana Joffe-WaltUh-huh. She speaks to you in English?BaniasYeah. Do you hear that? Do you hear that wee-wee-wee?Chana Joffe-WaltI do. Yeah. What is it?Maram HamaidSo Banias is-- [SIGHS] what is it?BaniasIt's the whoosh, whoosh, whoosh. A war plane.Chana Joffe-WaltIt's a warplane. I do hear it, yeah.BaniasI, of course, hear it, because it never ends.Chana Joffe-WaltBanias then takes the phone from her mom-- having told me what they are hearing, begins pointing out what they're seeing, saying, look at this-- as if I can also see, even though we're not on a video call. She says, here we have the window, as you can see. Here's the curtains. There are flowers. We don't have any sofas, just-- Mom, how do you say it?Chana Joffe-WaltMattresses?BaniasJust "may-tresses," as you can see. We sit sometimes on bed, on the ground. Women are covering their heads all the time, as you can see.Maram Hamaid[LAUGHS] She couldn't see. You should tell her.Chana Joffe-WaltYeah, tell me.BaniasOK. Oh, did you see our room?Chana Joffe-WaltNo.BaniasIf you see it, you will-- you will run, run, run, run from this.Chana Joffe-WaltWhy?Maram Hamaid[LAUGHS]BaniasBecause it's so old and dusty.Chana Joffe-WaltMaram told me later she was so surprised at Banias's performance in this call. That was the word she used. Apparently, Banias was marching around with the phone in front of her, telling people, I need the room, please, jumping on the mattress, standing on the table, pointing, saying, here's my brother, Iyas.BaniasThere he is. He's pretty and smart like me.Chana Joffe-WaltGaza is full of kids. About half the population is under 18 years old, and about half of that group is under 10 years old, like Banias. A huge way in which children in this war are different from kids in other war zones is that children in Gaza are not allowed to leave. They're not displaced to some other spot away from the fighting. They're displaced inside Gaza. They're stuck in the violence and stuck with their families, in crowded rooms or tents, doing the things that kids everywhere do, building their inner world, trying to make sense of the world around them. I was calling Maram that day to ask about the situation in Deir Balah, and Banias took the phone and said, no, no, no, don't ask her. Ask me.BaniasBeing in Deir a Balah is boring.Chana Joffe-WaltIt's boring?BaniasReally boring.Chana Joffe-WaltYeah.BaniasNot just-- bored, so bored. I really miss the burgers. And now we are on canned food. We have just the boxes of food, the food boxes. One day-- I want to tell you something.Chana Joffe-WaltTell me.BaniasOne day, when we are sitting in our room talking about something, then boom! A big bomb broke all of the windows, and the home was shaking. And my baby brother, Iyas, has got injured in his head. We have noticed the glass in his head.Chana Joffe-WaltOof. Is he OK, Banias?BaniasYes, now he's all right.Chana Joffe-WaltWe talked for a while and then said goodbye. That was the end of April. And then, in July, I saw Maram's name on my phone.Chana Joffe-WaltHi. Maram? Can you hear me? Hello?BaniasYeah.Chana Joffe-WaltIt was Banias. She wanted to talk, tell me about her day. Then, another day.BaniasHello.Chana Joffe-WaltHi, Banias.BaniasDo you want to talk to me?Chana Joffe-WaltYeah, sure. What are you doing?Through the summer, into the fall, Banias called me, and I called her. Maram, her mother, gave permission for these phone calls, but it was always just Banias on the line, telling me about herself and her life. I wanted to know what it's like to be a kid in this war. And here was this kid who wanted to talk.Banias was a natural narrator of her own life. She was constantly directing my attention. These are my friends. This is my school stationery, as you can see. Do you want to know what we're doing right now? I'll tell you.Unfortunately for me, she also had zero interest in satisfying my journalistic agenda. If I asked Banias a question she was not interested in, she'd yawn dramatically, stage yawn. [YAWNS] It's getting late. I'm so tired. Let's look over here.I had been reading and thinking about what was happening in Gaza all the time, talking to people there. Every call with Banias was something I hadn't heard that was completely different from when adults tell the story.So that is today's episode. We're calling it "The Narrator." We're going to listen to this kid in Gaza, a narrator who does not ask permission to narrate. She takes the phone with a soaring confidence that what she has to tell you is interesting and important, and I agree with her. Stay with us.Part One: Part OneChana Joffe-WaltIt'sThisAmericanLife.My calls with Banias were sporadic. Sometimes we talked once a week. Sometimes a month would go by. Usually, we talked at the end of the day, her time, while she was sitting on a mattress inside the house, fidgeting. There were always lots of people and activity in the background, but Banias never explained much about who was there or what they were doing. She told me about what she was doing, what she wanted me to know and sometimes see.BaniasI prefer a video call.[BEEPING]Chana Joffe-WaltLet me try.BaniasOK.Chana Joffe-WaltHi.BaniasThis is my complete look.Chana Joffe-WaltThat's a good look.She's in a pink shirt that says "Dream." Huge eyes, dark hair, and pigtails with two loose curls very purposefully framing her face.Chana Joffe-WaltAnd you have earrings. I didn't know you had earrings.BaniasOh, yeah, I do have earrings. And this is my blue shorts.Chana Joffe-WaltYeah.BaniasAnd this, this is my head accessory for today. It has rhinestones.Chana Joffe-WaltUh-huh. Purple, furry with rhinestones.BaniasYeah, it's beautiful.Chana Joffe-WaltWhen Banias and I first started talking on the phone, my questions were pretty basic. What do you do all day? She was in a house with 80 people, which is unusual in Gaza right now to live in a house. Most people are in tents or schools or other temporary shelters. Banias and her mom, dad, and baby brother were on the ground floor of this house, sharing that floor with about 20 relatives. There was one bedroom.She slept on a mattress on the floor, alongside her parents, brother, grandpa, uncle, and aunt. Everyone else slept in the living area. If Banias wanted any time in the tiny bathroom, she got up early in the morning. Then she ate breakfast. And then what?BaniasToday we play school games.Chana Joffe-WaltWhat does that mean?BaniasWe're pretending that we're in the school. I was a student. And one of my friends was the teacher.Chana Joffe-WaltWhat classes were you taking?BaniasMath class.Chana Joffe-WaltOK. And did you write actual math, or is it just pretend?BaniasIt was actual, the plus and the minus and the equal. It was actual. But it was in a game, not real.Chana Joffe-WaltAt this point, July, Banias had not been in an actual class in an actual school building for nine months. But she played school every day with three other girls, two younger and one older. There were other kids in the building, but everyone else was just OK, or a boy, or a baby.When aid organizations go into other war zones, one of the first things they do for kids is set up schools, because children need a sense of routine and a sense that life is moving forward toward a future. There's no safe place in Gaza to set up schools like that, so Banias and her friends in the building created that for themselves. They played school for hours. There were lectures. There were assignments. There were exams.Chana Joffe-WaltWho is usually in charge of what you're going to do that day?BaniasThe girl that's older than me. Her name is Dana.Chana Joffe-WaltHow old is Dana?BaniasShe is 12 years old. And she has an iPad.Chana Joffe-WaltDana is generous with her iPad. So this is another part of Banias's day-- games on the iPad. When the war started, her mother's screen time rules went out the window. But also, Israel cut off electricity to Gaza. There's just generators and solar panels, so screen time is limited anyway.BaniasAnd today, we played a cafe game.Chana Joffe-WaltOh, a cafe? That's new.BaniasI was the chef. Yeah. And one of my friends was the customer. I cooked some salad and some pancake.Chana Joffe-WaltSay it one more time?BaniasI cooked salad and pancake. And I made some hamburgers and some pizza.Chana Joffe-WaltBanias was re-enacting her old life, where she had teachers and exams and went out to cafes. There was one they used to go to every Saturday.BaniasYeah, it was really close. It was just in the next street in our house.Chana Joffe-WaltOK. Did they make salad and pancakes?BaniasNo, but I used to order some noodles and some hot chocolate.Chana Joffe-WaltMm-hmm. What did you eat in real life today?BaniasToday we have eaten some beans, some white beans.Chana Joffe-WaltDo you ever get to eat pancakes or noodles or burgers?BaniasI hate pancakes and noodles.Chana Joffe-WaltYou do?BaniasYes.Chana Joffe-WaltOh, wow.BaniasDo you believe somebody hates these things?Chana Joffe-WaltNo.BaniasI do.Chana Joffe-WaltThey're so good.BaniasBut I hate them.Chana Joffe-WaltI was never sure what motivated Banias to want to talk to me. She seemed to like telling me about her day, practicing her English. She had an ongoing fascination with the time difference between us. She always wanted to check in on that.BaniasYou're at morning or at night?Chana Joffe-WaltIt's the afternoon. It's just--BaniasAfternoon?Chana Joffe-WaltMm-hmm.BaniasWe're in the middle of the night.Chana Joffe-WaltShe'd call when she felt annoyed that Dana got to be the teacher that day yet again.BaniasI am bored of being the student every day. I'm the oldest. I should be the teacher. Oof!Chana Joffe-WaltAnd she'd call when she was bored. She'd call because I was an adult who would pay attention to her. Banias had to create activity-- interest-- out of such little material. Sometimes I got the impression I was there to help with that. Like, one night she was on the phone with me, and another phone rang. And like a character in a play, she went, oh, look, the phone is ringing.[PHONE RINGING]BaniasOh, my God. Who's ringing the phone? Get away. Get lost.Chana Joffe-Walt[LAUGHS]BaniasWe have to sleep.Chana Joffe-WaltYou're pretty funny, Banias.BaniasYes, I'm funny. Dana always say for me that I'm a bit funny.Chana Joffe-WaltReally?BaniasFunny bunny.Chana Joffe-WaltMm-hmm. You are funny.BaniasYes. I'm a funny bunny.Chana Joffe-WaltSo Banias had her own reasons to call me. When I called her, it was for different reasons. I'd call her because I'd read about a bombing campaign or fighting near where she was. Was she OK? And what was she thinking about all the violence around her? What is this like for an eight-year-old?In the middle of the summer, there was a series of intense airstrikes near Banias. I was curious if she'd heard them or seen them, but I also wanted to follow her lead and what she wanted to talk about.Chana Joffe-WaltDo you have some time to talk?BaniasOh, yes, of course. I'm available.Chana Joffe-WaltGreat.BaniasI'm actually good.Chana Joffe-WaltYeah?BaniasDoing good. Last days, we have heard a bit of bombing around us.Chana Joffe-WaltUh-huh. Yeah, I've been reading in the news that there's been a lot of bombing.BaniasYeah, I do know. It was loud.Chana Joffe-WaltIs it scary?BaniasNo. For me, no. Me and my friends, we were playing hide-and-seek. We don't ever get bored of it. It's our favorite game. When we are playing, some strange things happens with us. I will tell you then.Chana Joffe-WaltOK, I thought. Here it is. She's about to tell me something big about what it's like to be a kid playing hide-and-seek with bombs going off nearby. Banias told me, so we were playing, and we ran to the backyard.BaniasWhen we run to the backyard, we see some insects in the ground.Chana Joffe-WaltMm-hmm.BaniasWe said, we see some insects on the ground. And me and the kids, we watched it.Chana Joffe-WaltThat's it. That's her whole story. The strange thing that happened when they ran outside is they saw insects, a kind of insect they'd never seen before. Not the bombing-- bugs.Children are not known for their sense of scale or the longevity of their attention. And maybe it wasn't surprising that pretty much every time I asked about the war, Banias didn't really want to engage. She didn't exactly ignore me, but it didn't seem to be the main thing she was thinking about.Like, when an airstrike broke the windows in her house, she wanted to tell me about a prank she played on Dana. In mid-August, when ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas seemed to be unraveling yet again, and all the adults I was talking to in Gaza were deeply dispirited, here was Banias.BaniasI think there will be a ceasefire soon.Chana Joffe-WaltYou do? Why do you think that?BaniasBecause it's really close to end.Chana Joffe-WaltWhy? Why do you say-- what gives you that idea?BaniasMom and Dad tell me. [YAWNS]Chana Joffe-WaltI heard that yawn-- noting it. Discussion of the war-- over. There was one moment when Banias was forced to engage. She couldn't avoid it. Banias's family had been sheltering in Deir Balah for almost a year, when, suddenly, at the end of August, they got an evacuation order. Israel posted a map on social media designating certain blocks in Deir Balah unsafe.And I saw that Maram, Banias's mother, had written something for Al Jazeera about the order. I had hardly spoken to Maram for months, but I had followed her reporting on bombings and food shortages. This article, though, was personal. She wrote about her confusion about what to do next. "I've never felt so worthless as a human being," she wrote."A single Facebook post from an Israeli military spokesperson can upend our lives in an instant. Have you ever felt like a toy being played with left and right, east and west, pushed from one place to another, south to Khan Younis, out of Rafah, back to Khan Younis, then to Nuseirat, only to be driven out again? People are literally running through the streets like mad, clutching what little they have left. We have nothing left. Our hearts are broken, and our minds are frayed.I look around at the few possessions I've managed to gather over the past 10 months-- a stove, cups, plates, pots, winter clothes, summer clothes, mattresses, blankets, batteries, light bulbs, big bottles of drinking water, tubs to wash clothes in. If I leave everything, there's no way to replace it. There are no markets, no supplies, no money to spare. We're running and running aimlessly. People screaming, suffering, and dying while the world watches," end quote. And then my phone rang.Chana Joffe-WaltHello?BaniasHello?Chana Joffe-WaltHi, Banias.BaniasYeah.Chana Joffe-WaltDo you want to talk?BaniasUh, OK. Today, we have done a new thing.Chana Joffe-WaltWhat'd you do?BaniasWe drawed some pictures. I imagined that there's a garden, that there's some people walking inside it.[CHILD CRYING]Stop crying. Go in the bedroom.Chana Joffe-WaltOK.BaniasSo let's continue.Chana Joffe-WaltOK.BaniasOh, my friends were with me, too, drawing. And one of my friends have drawed a plane.Chana Joffe-WaltLike a war plane or a plane you travel in?BaniasUh, traveling.Chana Joffe-WaltOK. Do you ever draw anything about the war?BaniasNo, nothing at all.Chana Joffe-WaltWhy not?BaniasBecause-- I really can't.Chana Joffe-WaltWhy?BaniasI feel mad.Chana Joffe-WaltUh-huh.BaniasI feel mad of this things. I can draw them. But I don't like a war plane, a helicopter, and rockets. I don't like that. There's lots of things here I feel mad from it. My friends always make me mad from things. Sometimes I don't want anybody to enter this room. Get out. Mom! OK.Maram HamaidI'm sorry.BaniasOK, let's continue.Chana Joffe-WaltOK.BaniasI was saying they always attack me.Chana Joffe-WaltYour friends?BaniasYeah.Chana Joffe-WaltI was eager to ask Banias about the news of the evacuation, but what she wanted to talk about was a fight she had that day with another kid in the building, a girl. Banias calls her "the girl with the bad personality." That girl told Banias today that one of her pictures was no good.BaniasShe have a really bad personality. I said for her, are you looking for a fight, in our language.Chana Joffe-WaltAnd what did she say?BaniasYes, I am.Chana Joffe-Walt[LAUGHS]BaniasAnd we fighted all day. She's the most bad friend.Chana Joffe-WaltDid she not know about the evacuation order? She must, right? I didn't want to scare her.Chana Joffe-WaltBanias, I saw your mom wrote about people leaving Deir Balah.BaniasYes.Chana Joffe-WaltHave you--BaniasBut we will go to Al-Zawayda, to our relatives.Chana Joffe-WaltWhat do you think about that?BaniasI think it was a good idea. We're packing our clothes and our-- wait for a minute. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Oh, and we're packing also our mattresses and our money.Chana Joffe-WaltWhere will you sleep if you pack your mattress?BaniasUm, in the tent. Our relatives live in a home. But we will make a camp next to them.Chana Joffe-WaltOK. Have you ever lived in a tent?BaniasNo.Chana Joffe-WaltAre you--BaniasBut I want to try. I think it will be something creative.Chana Joffe-WaltAre you scared to move, to leave your friends or to leave your house?BaniasI'm ready to leave them.Chana Joffe-WaltYou are? [CHUCKLES]BaniasI'm not ready for more fights. I want to leave them. Today, I told one of my friends that I will leave. I've told everybody.Chana Joffe-WaltIs that sad?BaniasIt was drama.Chana Joffe-WaltWhy?BaniasBecause she is a drama girl. Don't leave. That's everything.Chana Joffe-WaltUh-huh.BaniasDon't leave this house. We want more fights.Chana Joffe-WaltBanias was ready to leave because it meant she could get away from the girl with the bad personality. Almost a million kids in Gaza have made a move like this since Israel invaded, many of them multiple times. So it was interesting to hear how a child was thinking about it.Banias was ready to flee the home she'd lived in for 10 months at that point, to move into a tent because she got into a fight with an annoying girl that day, because that is what just happened-- and because Banias is eight. She told me her friend Dana is leaving, too.BaniasShe is going to Al Mawasi. But me, I will go to Zawayda, me and my family. Yeah, our relatives are there. When the Israeli army tell us to move, we'll move to Al Zawayda.Chana Joffe-WaltYou're not scared?Banias[YAWNS] No.Chana Joffe-WaltOK.Maram Hamaid[INAUDIBLE] crying and he was praying.BaniasMom, let that a secret!Maram HamaidNo, it's not a secret. You have to express yourself.BaniasI'm fine, I'm fine.Chana Joffe-WaltWhat does your mom think is a secret?BaniasUh-- a family secret. No. No. I will not give you the mobile. I want to talk to her myself. No, [INAUDIBLE]. No, no.Maram HamaidIs that Chana?Chana Joffe-WaltHi.Maram HamaidHi. How are you?Chana Joffe-WaltGood.BaniasNo, no! Let that away! Let that away! Let that away!Maram HamaidI was just--BaniasNo, no! Let that away.Maram Hamaid--I just heard her--BaniasPlease, please!Maram Hamaid--saying that--BaniasNot here!Chana Joffe-WaltYour--Maram HamaidSo Banias was crying.BaniasNo! Can you keep that away?Maram HamaidIt's normal.BaniasIt's a secret. I don't want--Maram HamaidThis is normal.BaniasI don't want to let anybody know that I was-- I wasn't!Maram HamaidNo.BaniasNo, I was--Maram HamaidYou were crying.Banias--I wasn't!Maram HamaidSo she was afraid. She was nervous. And she went into--BaniasI was not afraid!Maram Hamaid--a circle--BaniasI was not nervous!Maram Hamaid--of feeling sad and feeling nervous--Banias[INAUDIBLE] Keep that away!Maram Hamaid--very afraid of what is going on. And I just surprisingly heard her saying that I'm not.BaniasLet that away!Maram HamaidI didn't feel afraid.BaniasLet that away!Chana Joffe-WaltWhy? Why does she not want to talk about that?Maram HamaidAnd she's now saying that it's a secret. Like, she doesn't want to recall some horrific memories for her, or like she got over the feeling of being afraid.Chana Joffe-WaltWhen did she find out you were evacuating?Maram HamaidExcuse me?BaniasI didn't cry!Maram Hamaid[CHUCKLES]BaniasI didn't cry!Maram HamaidHallas, she believes you. She believes you. She believes you. I know. Like, you're a brave girl. Like, you can get over anything. But I'm telling you, Banias. It's not a shame. It's not a shameful thing to feel afraid that you're scared and you're afraid of something like this. Yeah? So--BaniasSo--Maram Hamaid--right? It's normal. You should be scared. Yeah, this is very normal.BaniasI was not--Maram HamaidAnd do what I can.Banias--scared!Maram HamaidOK, Mama, you are hallas. You are afraid to say what you want. But I want to just to clarify this point. [LAUGHS] You were crying like crazy upon hearing the news. And I'm telling her, like I totally understand her feelings.Chana Joffe-WaltWhen did that happen, Maram? When did you tell her?Maram HamaidIt's just less than two hours ago.Chana Joffe-WaltOh, wow, just recently. OK. OK.Maram HamaidYeah, yeah, yeah. Very recent, you know? Very recent. We got the news suddenly. [LAUGHS] I was really laughing when I heard her trying to show a perfectionist reaction and so positive. She was very positive.But it was totally the opposite, you know? Just, like, two hours, less than two hours, she was hiding behind the curtain, crying and like crazy. And she continued this cycle. And then we find it's really hard.Chana Joffe-WaltI almost couldn't bear hearing this. Banias's visceral, immediate panic was so uncomfortable, hearing her mother pierce the carefully constructed artifice she'd presented to me. And it was disorienting. It made me think of all the things I didn't know.Chana Joffe-WaltDoes she want to talk again?Maram HamaidYeah, yeah. She's here. She's here.Chana Joffe-WaltOK.Maram Hamaid[INAUDIBLE] come and [INAUDIBLE]BaniasHello?Chana Joffe-WaltHi, Banias.BaniasHi.Chana Joffe-WaltHi. How come you didn't want me to know that you were upset?BaniasI'm not upset.Chana Joffe-WaltYou're not upset. Do you want to talk about that or no?BaniasNot yet.Chana Joffe-WaltWhat?BaniasNot yet.Chana Joffe-WaltIs there anything else you want to tell me about how you're doing?BaniasI'm already so sleepy.Chana Joffe-WaltYeah, it's late. So I hope you have an easy night, Banias.BaniasI hope so.Chana Joffe-WaltAn incomplete list of things Banias does not have control over-- can she go home? No. Is there food? Not enough. Is there school? No. Is there safety here? No. Banias lives in what has become the most dangerous place in the world to be a child.Disease in Gaza is widespread. Children face acute malnutrition. Kids are getting horrible skin infections. Polio has reappeared in a 10-month-old baby. Children are losing their limbs, their parents, and they are being killed, constantly. More than 13,000 children have been killed so far, including at least 710 babies, some of them born and then killed since the war began.Maram told me Banias has seen dead children. She's seen their small bodies wrapped in white cloth by the hospital. I asked Maram later, what do you think Banias gets out of talking to me? She told me, you're a bubble for her.Every time you call, she treats it like an important meeting, tries to find a private space away from all of us. Everyone around Banias is in the midst of this chaos, she said. You're not here. You're not experiencing any of this.Banias was telling me a version of life where she has ultimate authority, where she gets to be the narrator. Who doesn't want that? I was coming to her to understand the war, but she was coming to me to not talk about the war, until one day, she did. That's coming up from Chicago Public Radio, when our program continues.Part Two: Part TwoChana Joffe-WaltIt'sThisAmericanLife.I'm Chana Joffe-Walt, sitting in for Ira Glass. Our show today, "The Narrator," an eight-year-old in Gaza, tells us about her life in the middle of a war.This war started in 2023. Hamas attacked Israel, killed about 1,200 people, and took 251 people hostage. Since then, Israel has launched a 14-month ground invasion and bombing campaign in Gaza. More than 44,000 Palestinians have been killed, and more than 13,000 of those dead are children.Banias and her family never moved into a tent. After the Israeli army issued that evacuation order for Deir Balah, her parents agonized over when and if they should flee for days. The dangers of moving into a tent could be worse than tanks outside their house. They decided to stay put. It was early October. The family was coming up on a year of war and displacement, and Banias had an announcement.BaniasThe war stopped. The war stopped. Do you know, the war stopped?Chana Joffe-WaltYesterday, there was no bombing or fighting?BaniasNo. Ever, never. The war stopped.Chana Joffe-WaltWhat are you talking about?BaniasBecause our house was bombed.Chana Joffe-WaltYour house was bombed?BaniasYeah. Just kidding.Chana Joffe-Walt[LAUGHS]BaniasBut--Chana Joffe-WaltWhat are you doing to me, Banias?BaniasBut there was good news yesterday. Yesterday, tonight, it was-- wee! We had a party. There was very, very good news.Chana Joffe-WaltWhat was the good news?BaniasOh. Um-- we have killed all of them.Chana Joffe-WaltWhat do you mean? Who did you kill all of?BaniasNot all of them-- thousands and thousands and thousands of them! But I can't remember who.Chana Joffe-WaltYou're talking about the Israelis?BaniasYes, yes. Thousands and thousands. We killed thousands, thousands, thousands.Chana Joffe-WaltI realized as we were talking, this was October 2. The day before, Iran had launched 180 missiles at Israel.Chana Joffe-WaltThat was--BaniasYes, that was yesterday. Yesterday, we had a party for that. We bring coffee, make juice. Oh! Kay-yef-nah.Chana Joffe-WaltKay-yef-nah?BaniasYes.Chana Joffe-WaltWhat's "kay-yef-nah" mean?BaniasThat means "we had a good time" in Arabic.Chana Joffe-WaltBanias, you're talking about the missiles yesterday to the Israelis?BaniasYes.Chana Joffe-WaltHow did you feel about that?BaniasIt was-- whoa! It was very good. [NON-ENGLISH]Chana Joffe-WaltThis threw me, hearing Banias talk about killing Israelis. No Israelis were killed from these missiles. One Palestinian man was, near Jericho. It's one of those empty truisms about war, that kids in a war learn to hate the other side, a true thing about war that also can feel a little abstract.But here it was, showing up, randomly folded into the rest of Banias's narration to her playing with me, messing with me, that the home she was sheltering in was bombed-- which it could have been, but wasn't. I asked Maram if I could talk with her about this day. I told her what Banias had told me.Chana Joffe-WaltWhat was happening that day?Maram HamaidYeah, actually, on that day, it was a huge surprise, actually. Suddenly, we were at home, and we heard the sounds of cheer and people around us cheering and chanting. The internet was cut.And I thought from the first instance that there was a ceasefire or something like this. The war ended, you know? So people around us started to say that Iran is bombing Israel right now. And we could see the lights of the missiles being sent to Israel, in the sky. And people around us are just cheering and celebrating and clapping.I was in emotion. I was very emotional. I really cried. I felt like, oh, my God, really? Someone who's trying just to stop Israel, and to say that by the missiles and by the rockets, the same language that Israel understands and uses in Gaza throughout the years.Chana Joffe-WaltWere you celebrating? Were you guys celebrating?Maram HamaidI didn't. We were just like excited. We stayed home because maybe missiles could drop by mistake on us. We were just trying to follow up the news.Chana Joffe-WaltMaram told me she does not tell Banias to hate Israel or celebrate when Israel is attacked. Banias's dad, she says, also doesn't do this. But Maram was not surprised to hear Banias was saying this. She remembers feeling the same way when she was a kid growing up in Gaza.Maram was 10 years old when she first experienced Israeli bombing after the Second Intifada broke out. She remembers crying when she saw her first dead body and collapsing when she saw footage of a 12-year-old Palestinian kid, Mohammed al-Durrah, killed while hiding next to his father. Banias was born in 2016. Her first war was when she was four years old.Maram HamaidI totally understand that she herself, as a Palestinian kid, she views Israel as an enemy, an enemy that bombs us, that kills us, that targets us.Chana Joffe-WaltThere's something I've been thinking about when it comes to kids in wars, but kids in Gaza in particular. It's something a psychologist told me, Dr. Iman Farajallah, who studies the effect of war and occupation on Palestinian kids. She told me it really gets under her skin when people at the UN or healthcare professionals or whatever say kids in Gaza are suffering from PTSD.Post-traumatic stress means the traumatic event is over. For kids in Gaza, the trauma is continuous. There is no post. There's no opportunity for recovery. Instead, there is just coping. Dr. Farajallah says, you'll see kids cope in all different ways. Some kids act out. Some can't leave their parents' side. Other kids get obsessed with soccer or drawing. Or children try to shape their world in other ways.For instance, Maram told me when Banias was six years old, there was an Israeli military operation in Gaza, lots of fighting. And Banias was sitting on the window, watching ambulances rush people to the hospital, blowing bubbles out the window. Maram asked her, what are you doing? And Banias said, I'm trying to change the mood.Maram HamaidI know Banias. She is an optimistic one. She's someone who's positive. And she doesn't even want to share her negative thoughts with others--BaniasHello?Maram Hamaid--even when she's fearful. Like--BaniasHello?Maram HamaidThis is my space, Banias. Please go away.BaniasNo!Maram HamaidI'm talking. She's someone who loves life and loves to play and loves to--Chana Joffe-WaltIt's almost like she's willing it. She's willing-- She's using all of her force to will life into being easier than it is.Maram HamaidYeah. Yeah. And she always trying to change the mood for the people to make them feel optimistic.BaniasHi.Chana Joffe-WaltHi, Banias.BaniasHi. Hi, Chana. How are you?Chana Joffe-WaltThat was basically the end of my conversation with Maram. As she did the first time around, Banias decided it was time for us to move on. My calls with Banias have grown more infrequent. The last time she called, I was in my office heading into a meeting. I was going to just say a quick hello, make sure she was OK.BaniasHello?Chana Joffe-WaltHi, Banias. How are you?[BEEPING]BaniasHi.Chana Joffe-WaltAre you calling me on video?BaniasYes, I am.Chana Joffe-WaltOK, hang on. Let's see.BaniasHi.Chana Joffe-WaltOh, there you are. There you are. Hi.BaniasHi. I'm watching a film. Do you want to see? It's calledHomeAlone.Chana Joffe-Walt[CHUCKLES]BaniasDo you know?Chana Joffe-WaltI do.BaniasI love it. Would you like to watch with me? Would you like to watch?Chana Joffe-WaltI paused, looked at my watch, saw my coworkers heading to the meeting room, and decided to go ahead with her agenda.BaniasOh, let's see it together.Chana Joffe-WaltOK, for a few minutes.BaniasOh. Oh, my God. I want to cover myself. It's so cold here. Oh. OK. Oh, my God. I'm here.Chana Joffe-WaltOK.She's under the covers with her phone and her laptop in purple pajamas. She's sitting on her mattress on the floor. And she's pointing the phone at her screen, so we can watch together.BaniasI'm covering myself in the tent.Chana Joffe-Walt[CHUCKLES]BaniasOh. Here. Do you see?Chana Joffe-WaltYeah, I can see.BaniasOh!ManHey! Shoplifter!BaniasOh, my God! Oi!Chana Joffe-WaltOf course, Banias is a vocal movie watcher.BaniasWho is he?Chana Joffe-WaltShe has a running commentary on the characters, repeats English words that are new to her, explains the movie.BaniasHe's now skating on the ice. They leave him alone. But he's happy, happy.Chana Joffe-WaltWould you be happy if that happened?BaniasYes! I'm free!Chana Joffe-WaltYou would?BaniasI will shout in the home, I'm free! I'm free!Chana Joffe-Walt[LAUGHS]ManWe're the Wet Bandits. You're sick. You know that? Really silly!BaniasReally silly.ManThat's it! That's a sick thing to say!Chana Joffe-WaltMcCaulley Caulkin-- who I'd forgotten is also eight years old in this movie-- is walking home, crosses a driveway, just as the two burglars, Joe Pesci and the other guy, pull out in their van, screech to a halt, and McCaulley Caulkin does his blonde surprise face.ManHey, watch out![TIRES SQUEALING][SCREAMING]Chana Joffe-Walt[LAUGHS]BaniasOh. [GIGGLES] That's so funny.Man 1Hey, hey! You gotta watch out for traffic, son, you know?KevinSorry.Man 2Santa don't visit the funeral home, little buddy.Man 1OK, OK. Merry Christmas.BaniasI do like the Christmas design.Chana Joffe-WaltMm-hmm.BaniasI really like this movie. And when they travel to New York-- oh, where do you live?Chana Joffe-WaltI live in New York. That's where I live.BaniasIn the New York?Chana Joffe-WaltMm-hmm.BaniasYes. Kevin's family travels there last time. You live in New York?Chana Joffe-WaltMm-hmm, I do.BaniasOh, I want to tell you something. What about this statue that you have?Chana Joffe-WaltThe Statue of Liberty?BaniasYes! It's in New York.Chana Joffe-WaltYeah.BaniasYou see it? I want to see it!Chana Joffe-WaltOh, yeah. I don't see it right now, but I see it-- I see it pretty often.BaniasWhen you are out of your house, you see it?Chana Joffe-WaltYeah, when I go--BaniasOh, yeah.Chana Joffe-Walt--when I go to work, sometimes I can see it.BaniasOh, I want to go to work with you to see it. I'd love to.Chana Joffe-WaltBanias, the houses there in that part of the movie, does it look anything like Gaza?BaniasNo.Chana Joffe-WaltHow is it different?BaniasNo. Gaza is more beautiful.Chana Joffe-WaltEven now?BaniasYes, even now, and every time.Chana Joffe-WaltTwo days earlier, Israeli airstrikes hit Al Aqsa Hospital in Deir Balah, right near Banias's apartment. The hospital was surrounded by tents filled with displaced people sleeping. The airstrikes caused a fire that ripped through those tents. I'd seen Maram sharing images and videos of people sleeping in the tents burned alive.I wondered if Banias had seen those images, but I didn't ask. Instead, we watched this Christmas movie. We watched Kevin trick the burglars into thinking his family is home by staging a fake party in his house.BaniasOh, my. Oh, my God. What's that?Chana Joffe-WaltAny war is a series of plot points. Even in an ongoing war, a never-ending and no-longer-new war, we track its progress by the worst moments. I kept calling Banias with this expectation, waiting for the story of the war as I was understanding it, to somehow intersect with her life as she was experiencing it.I kept imagining, dreading, that one of those moments will break through, that something bad will happen to Banias. One of those horrible plot points will become her plot point.But something bad is happening to Banias. This is the plot point for her. She's sitting under the covers with no electricity, no heat, winter approaching. Banias has not been in school for over a year. She has no home. She has a cough, and there is no medicine.Her friends have scattered. Some of them are dead. Her relatives are all over. Some of them are dead. She's eating canned beans, instead of burgers. She's finding glass in her brother's head. This is her life. This is the story she has to narrate.BaniasDo you want to see where he will go? I don't know exactly where he will go.Chana Joffe-WaltHe's hiding.BaniasHe's hiding.Chana Joffe-WaltOK, Banias, I'm going to go.BaniasOh? Do you want to leave? I want to continue this movie and then go to sleep.Chana Joffe-WaltOK, sleep well. I'll talk to you soon.BaniasWhere are you? Are you still here?Chana Joffe-WaltI'm here.BaniasHello? Hello?Chana Joffe-WaltI'm here.BaniasAre you still here?Chana Joffe-WaltYes, I am.We have a couple minutes left in this episode, and I have a small update. Recently, Banias's family moved-- not far-- an apartment a couple miles from Deir Balah, where they've been staying. The new place is less crowded. There's more privacy for her family. It has trees outside and a refrigerator-- that doesn't work, but still. The apartment is quiet, temporary.And it's not home. Banias knows she can't go home to the north of Gaza, where she's from. She knows her home was destroyed. She's seen pictures of her neighborhood exploded, on fire. And she's seen video of the empty space where her house was, the small mountains of rubble.The gray couch with yellow cushions that she sat on after school, the chandelier her mother chose, the mirror by the door, the teacups and trays filled with treats, her new reimagined big girl bedroom with an Elsa bedspread, her desk, the pink moon they hung on the ceiling-- all of that is somewhere in that pile of rubble. All of that is there in the north of Gaza, their life.But the north of Gaza has been transformed. There were about a million people living in northern Gaza when the war started, over 270,000 homes. Everyone was told to leave, to go south. Most people did. And now those people are separated from the north of Gaza by a wide militarized zone that they cannot cross.Israel has been building and fortifying this military zone for the last few months. It cuts right across Gaza, splits Gaza in two, completely separating the north of Gaza, where Banias is from, from the south of Gaza, where she's been displaced to. This military zone is called the Netzarim Corridor. It has a constant military presence, and it's big, around 20 square miles. It takes up more than 12% of the entire territory of Gaza.In order to build it, Israel cleared out a wide stretch of land, demolished hundreds of buildings, from the Israeli border all the way to the ocean. And in that space, Israel installed checkpoints and paved roads and flags and water lines and cell phone towers. It looks like something you'd put in place if you're planning to stay a while.A former chief of staff of the Israeli military has called the emptying out of the north of Gaza an ethnic cleansing. He said, quote, "the land is being cleared of Arabs." Human Rights Watch, Oxfam, Amnesty International have all called what is happening in Gaza an ethnic cleansing, or a genocide.Israel denies this, and the Israeli military sent me a statement calling the charge of ethnic cleansing entirely baseless. It says it's working to dismantle Hamas's military infrastructure and is adhering to its obligations under international law.The people who remained in the north and never left are under siege, with increasingly limited food and medical care. The UN says children are, quote, "as ever, the first and most to suffer."So this latest move for Banias's parents, it feels like a new phase. It's a move from "I can't believe it's gone on this long" to "this is going to keep going on." For Banias, it's more of the same, more temporary, more displacement, displacement that looks pretty likely to last most, if not all, of her childhood.CreditsChana Joffe-WaltToday's episode was produced by Valerie Kipnis and edited by Laura Starecheski.
